Teenager dead after stabbings – as it happened,"Thank you for joining us on the blog today. Here is a wrap: Back and forth ensued over the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, comparing a pro-Palestinian protest at the Sydney Opera House to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Dutton defended the comparison today (“I don’t resile from that at all”), while the federal education minister, Jason Clare, slammed it (“if you want to run the country, you can’t run your mouth”). The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, said “it is never appropriate to compare the Port Arthur tragedy with anything, in any circumstance,” and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties argued such statements “dangerously conflate unrelated issues, leading to misinformation and unwarranted associations”. The Australian Medical Association released new analysis showing private health insurers’ management expenses and profits are the “key drivers of premium increases” for customers. Tasmania’s Liberals formally secured minority support, after independent MP and former Labor leader David O’Byrne provided a written assurance of confidence and supply. A 36-year old woman was taken to hospital after a reported stabbing at Bondi beach. In another reported stabbing across the state, one teenage boy died and another was hospitalised in Sydney’s west. New data revealed two-thirds of Tafe teachers are considering leaving the sector due to the ongoing impact of nearly a decade of Coalition cuts to public vocational education and pressure from the fee-free Tafe program. Save the Children Australia called on the Australian Government to urgently address rising starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, and avert a catastrophic famine in the occupied territory. And women in a Victorian community rocked by three recent killings demanded an end to male violence in a Ballarat rally. That is all for today, see you next week. Vaping penalties should be kept in ‘civil space’ rather than criminal, police tell NSW inquiry Assistant commissioner Scott Cook said it was not known how much money organised criminal groups made from vapes while disputing claims that gangs controlled the market. He suggested penalties around vaping be kept in the “civil space”, such as a licensing scheme under which suppliers could be threatened with cancellations. The last thing we want to see as police is criminalisation of vaping, particularly for young people – it will bring them into contact with the criminal justice system they will never get out of. The illicit market around tobacco and nicotine products with import restrictions was “nowhere near the prohibited drugs illicit market”, he added. Asked if police needed more power to control the sector, the assistant commissioner said: “no, not at all.” In addition to sufficient search and seizure powers, police had “significantly higher priorities than doing enforcement work for vapes”, he said. The committee’s deputy chair, Hugh McDermott, suggested those priorities were not for police to decide, adding that children as young as 11 were becoming addicted to illegally sold vapes due to a lack of enforcement. But Cook said if that was the government’s position, then NSW Health should be resourced to do that properly. McDermott earlier noted industry representatives declined to appear at the inquiry. - AAP Holding the smoke, students find new way to hide vaping Attempts to combat vaping could have perverse outcomes as students try to avoid detection and organised criminals eye off a market that only recently became illicit. An inquiry has been told schools are taking a health-focused approach to getting children to quit while a senior police officer has warned against criminalisation. Students caught vaping at school were being offered health-based interventions, education department deputy secretary of student wellbeing Martin Graham told a NSW parliamentary committee today. “There’s lot of vaping going on,” he said. The direction is not just about the education for why you shouldn’t vape, but also, moving them onto cessation, so helping them to get off the vapes. Graham said vaping had been added to behavioural policies with principals “who know their kids best” entitled to suspend students. Schools with a specific need for vaping detectors in toilets can request them, but they provided a false sense of security and could drive more dangerous behaviour. One that was brought to us by the young people and health professionals was suddenly a trend to try and hold the smoke in your lungs to avoid the detector … that’s just making things way worse. Enforcement since a crackdown started in January has primarily been handled by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Border Force and, more locally, NSW Health. NSW police were mainly interested in retailers with suspected links to organised crime, which assistant commissioner Scott Cook told the inquiry might take an increased foothold in a now-illicit market. “The vape market, up until recently, was supplied on a legal basis … in other countries where these vapes are coming from, they’re all legal,” he said. - AAP (More to come) A teen has died and another is in serious condition after multiple stabbings near a school in Sydney’s west. One person has been arrested, according to a NSW Police media release. Emergency services responded to the stabbings on Power Street, Doonside, about 3.40pm today. Before officers could arrive on scene, two teenage boys presented to Blacktown police station with stab wounds. They were treated at the scene for serious injuries. A teenage boy died at the scene, and the other was taken to hospital in a serious condition. Police have established crime scenes at both locations and are investigating. Inquiries are ongoing. Union denounces ACT government’s appointment of robodebt official  The Community and Public Sector Union has called out the ACT government for its decision to appoint an official involved in the robodebt scandal, saying it could have a “detrimental impact” on the union’s dealings with the territory’s administration and could “undermine the confidence of public servants”. The main public sector union has singled out the appointment of Lisa Carmody as the new deputy director general of the ACT government’s central department as “alarming”. During royal commissions hearings, Carmody, then the human service department’s acting chief counsel, said she had brief discussions in early 2017 with the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) about concerns over the scheme’s lawfulness. Ultimately, the AGS did not end up providing a legal opinion until late March 2019, more than two years later. The AGS said then the scheme was likely unlawful. The royal commission’s final report, which found the scheme was “crude and cruel” and illegal, did not make any adverse findings against Carmody. In a media release on Friday afternoon, the CPSU’s ACT regional secretary, Maddy Northam, called on the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, to reconsider the decision. The CPSU is concerned that this appointment could have a detrimental impact on the ACT government’s relationship with the union movement and undermine the confidence of public servants when raising concerns with management. An ACT government spokesperson clarified Barr was not involved in the recruitment process and added the CPSU’s assertions were not supported by the final robodebt report. A nationwide search was undertaken to recruit for this role, including a full merit based assessment and due diligence process. The Robodebt Royal Commission final report does not support the assertions of the CPSU. When Ms Carmody commences in the role, she will look to actively engage with all key stakeholders. Andrew Forrest accuses Facebook of ‘blatantly refusing’ to take action against scam ads Australian billionaire and philanthropist Andrew Forrest has accused Facebook’s parent company of “blatantly refusing” to take action against scam ads on its platform, as a criminal case he brought against Meta in WA was discontinued. On Friday, the commonwealth director of public prosecutions filed a discontinuance motion due to insufficient evidence in the criminal case brought by Forrest in the Western Australia district court over scam cryptocurrency ads bearing his likeness on Facebook. Forrest said it was a tragedy for the innocent victims of the adverts who had lost their life savings.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Veterans’ Affairs Minister Matt Keogh said he was concerned by the revelations: The minister has requested an urgent briefing by the ANAO (Australian National Audit Office) on its findings and recommendations, and will discuss these with the Australian War Memorial’s management as a priority.

The region, at the end of the River Murray in South Australia, provides vital habitat for a host of native aquatic and bird species, but is also used by some of the planet’s most impressive travellers. Dozens of species that migrate from as far away as Siberia and Alaska visit the area each year, to feed and rest alongside native birds including the endangered Australasian bittern and the vulnerable sharp-tailed sandpiper. The money, for the Coorong, Lower Lakes, Murray Mouth and South-East landscape, will be used to improve shorebird and wetland habitat. Specifically, there will be new infrastructure on wetland and flood plain flats to increase the area and duration of quality shorebird and wetland habitat, among other things. The money will underpin Australia’s commitment to international obligations including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: Restoring the Murray Mouth, Lower Lakes and Coorong is a critical investment in the health of the whole system. This new project will ensure the survival of our internationally significant wetlands and the plants and animals who call them home. - Australian Associated Press Thanks to Emily Wind for the day’s blog coverage.

Take care, and enjoy your weekend. Advocacy groups call for ‘programs and funding’ in response to heat map Advocacy groups have welcomed the release of a heat map from the federal government (see earlier post) but are urging them to address the root cause of extreme heat – climate change. Emma Bacon, the executive director of Sweltering Cities, said certain communities are feeling the impacts of extreme heat more than others. She pointed to Western Sydney, facing “climate, health, housing and cost of living crises all at once”. In my experience, the people living in hot homes and hot suburbs across the country know that heatwaves are dangerous and that members of their community are at risk. People aren’t underprepared for extreme heat through lack of knowledge, they’re being prevented from following health advice because they’re anxious about electricity bills so don’t turn on air con, or they’re renters and can’t make simple upgrades to their homes to be more energy efficient. The map demonstrates that some of the most dangerous areas are home to millions of people. We need to stop burning fossil fuels that contribute to rising temperatures and will make this crisis unmanageable for the public and the government. We cannot properly adapt to run-away global warming. Bacon hopes the heat map will be a “wake up call” for the government, and said she is “eagerly awaiting” an announcement of how federal, state and territory governments will respond to the map “with programs and funding to help our communities be safe”.",2024-04-12T07:54:57Z,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/apr/12/australia-news-live-victoria-police-to-resume-search-for-samantha-murphys-body-wong-urges-iran-not-to-attack-israel,The Guardian
"UK has real concerns about AI risks, says competition regulator","Just six major technology companies are at the heart of the AI sector through an “interconnected web” of more than 90 investments and partnerships links, the UK’s competition regulator has warned, sparking increased concern about the anti-competitive nature of the technology. Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, said AI foundation models – general-purpose AI systems such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini, on which consumer and business products are frequently built – were a potential “paradigm shift” for society. Speaking in Washington, she added that the immense concentration of power they represented would give a small number of companies “the ability and incentives to shape these markets in their own interests”. “When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,” Cardell said. “The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We’re committed to applying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at our disposal, now and in the future, to ensure that this transformational and structurally critical technology delivers on its promise.” The six identified by the CMA are Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, the leading supplier of chips for training and using AI. Their involvement in more than 90 partnerships and investments, the CMA said, could limit diversity and choice in the market. The “winner takes all” dynamics of digital markets led to the dominance of a few powerful platforms, Cardell said, and she was “determined to apply the lessons of history” to prevent the same thing from happening again. Highlighting three “interlinked” risks, Cardell said that competition in the AI sector could be harmed by companies that control critical inputs, from data to chips, restricting access to shield themselves from competition; companies using their market power to distort choice in AI services; and partnerships between key players exacerbating concentrations of market power. The CMA first announced its plans to investigate the market in AI foundation models in May 2023. The initial review, published in September, found that people should not expect the technology to have a positive outcome in the world at large.

Shohei Ohtani’s translator reportedly discussing plea deal around alleged $4.5m theft,"Shohei Ohtani’s former translator plans to plead guilty to federal crimes related to the alleged theft of money from the Los Angeles Dodgers star, the New York Times and ESPN reported on Wednesday. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers last month after admitting that he stole at least $4.5m from Ohtani, the biggest star in baseball, to pay off gambling debts. According to the Times and ESPN, Mizuhara’s plea agreement would include an admission that corroborates Ohtani’s version of the events – that the player never wagered on sports, had no idea that Mizuhara did so and was the victim of a “massive theft” by his former friend. A source told ESPN that Ohtani’s story around the events is accurate. MLB players are forbidden from betting on baseball, and face a lifetime ban if found to have placed a wager on their own team. They are allowed to bet on other sports in the nearly 40 US states where gambling is legal, but not in California. Mizuhara’s attorney, Michael G Freedman, declined comment to the Times and ESPN. The alleged theft became public knowledge when wire transfers from Ohtani’s bank account were discovered in a federal investigation of an alleged illegal bookmaker. Mizuhara initially said that Ohtani agreed to cover his gambling debts, then backtracked and admitted that Ohtani was unaware of the payment to the bookie in California. According to the reports, the IRS, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California conducted a joint investigation into Mizuhara’s actions. According to the Times, Mizuhara interacted with law-enforcement officials upon returning from South Korea after the Dodgers’ season-opening trip, but he was not arrested and his current whereabouts are unknown. The Times also says that Mizuhara changed the settings on Ohtani’s bank account so the player would not receive alerts if money was withdrawn. Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers while the team was in South Korea after initially telling the club that Ohtani aided him in paying off his debts. The Times says Ohtani became aware of Mizuhara’s story during a clubhouse meeting conducted in English. Although Ohtani does not speak fluent English, he understood enough of the conversation to confront Mizuhara later. It was at that point that Mizuhara allegedly admitted the theft to Ohtani. Mizuhara had been Ohtani’s translator since the star moved from Japan to play for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, and the pair were close friends as well as having a working relationship. Ohtani joined the Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal, and is one of the most famous people in his homeland.",2024-04-11T11:37:09Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/11/shohei-ohtanis-translator-reportedly-discussing-plea-deal-around-alleged-45m-theft,The Guardian
Five of the best books about siblings,"From the Marx Brothers to George Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss, siblings have a funny way of stealing the show. In Zadie Smith’s On Beauty, brothers and sisters are the “first evidence” and “last confirmation” of love – but in other books, riding solo wins out. “Part of the joy of being a novelist,” writes Cólm Tóibín, in the LRB essay collection, Sisters Come Second, “is to erase all trace of siblinghood”. The US calendar marks 10 April as National Sibling Day, but Europeans who choose to celebrate have a little longer to wait (it’s 31 May ). A brother, for Baldwin’s narrator, Hall Montana, is both a person and a means of comparison. “One’s little brother begins his life,” he reflects, “within the sturdy gates of one’s imagination … he is everything that you are not … Your life can now be written anew on the empty slate of his.” When that once-little brother is found dead “in a pool of blood”, Hall must relearn what his own life means. Blood and bloodlines dominate Baldwin’s musical, painful final novel. Against a sweeping backdrop of Harlem, Africa and Korea, Baldwin’s cast of siblings, friends and lovers tell a story about the families that are given to us, and the ones we create for ourselves. Set in the 1960s in what was then the German Democratic Republic, this tense, slim autobiographical novel spans three days in the life of Elisabeth, a painter, as she reflects on her relationship with her brother Uli. The narrative flickers between her memories of their childhood, with all its postwar hardship and her agonising realisation that her beloved brother is planning to defect to the west. A brilliant exploration of what happens when “the myth of sibling love” collides with political ideals, rendered in a sparkling new translation by Lucy Jones. A cult 60s coming-of-age tale, Cassandra at the Wedding feels very much of its time. Shades of the phoney-hating Holden Caulfield hover around our cool-eyed narrator, as she heads home to “hook-and-zip” her twin sister into her wedding gown, and “take over the bouquet while she received the ring, through the nose or on the finger”. Cassandra’s penchant for brandy, uppers and angst make for increasingly untethered behaviour, and the novel unfurls like a bacchanalian comedy of errors, with plenty of poolside action.

Literary delights delivered direct you after newsletter promotion Rausing’s account of her brother Hans’s and sister-in-law Eva’s struggles with drug addiction is, in many ways, an ordinary story. The “individuality of addicts”, Rausing writes “is curiously erased by the predictable progress of the disease”. But in this case, the Rausing family’s Tetra Pak fortune, and the grim circumstances around her sister-in-law’s death, created something more seemingly sensational, and her family’s life swiftly became the stuff of tabloid headlines. This is a thoughtful and compelling memoir about guilt, boundaries and the fictions of memory – “the stories that hold a family together, and the acts that can split it apart”. A girl begs the authorities to be allowed to bring her twin brother’s body home. The state resists. The story of Antigone is reshaped here for the 21st century, and on a global stage. This time the actors are not warring factions in Thebes but a young man drawn into Islamic State, his family in the UK, and the press that shapes and moulds their stories. With moving characterisation and elegant prose, Shamsie paints a tragedy of faith, loyalty and family on a grand canvas, but stays true to her all-too human characters.

World’s coal power capacity rises despite climate warnings,"The world’s coal power capacity grew for the first time since 2019 last year, despite warnings that coal plants need to close at a rate of at least 6% each year to avoid a climate emergency. A report by Global Energy Monitor found that coal power capacity grew by 2% last year, driven by an increase in new coal plants across China and a slowdown of plant closures in Europe and the US. About 69.5 gigawatts (GW) of coal plant capacity came online last year, of which two-thirds were built in China, according to the report. There were also plants built in Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Korea, Greece and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, a slowdown in coal plant shutdowns in the US and Europe led to more than 21GW retiring last year. This resulted in a net annual increase of almost 48.5GW for the year, the highest since 2016. The authors of the report said coal plants needed to shut at a faster pace, and that China needed to adopt stricter controls on its expansion of capacity. Flora Champenois, a Global Energy Monitor analyst, said: “Otherwise we can forget about meeting our goals in the Paris agreement and reaping the benefits that a swift transition to clean energy will bring,.” Climate scientists have said all coal plants should be shut by 2040 – unless they are fitted with effective carbon-removal technology – if governments hope to limit global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels. This would require an average of 126GW of coal plants to retire from the current fleet of 2,130GW every year for the next 17 years, according to the report, or the equivalent of about two plants a week. Champenois described last year’s coal plant expansion as an “anomaly” as more signs point to it “reversing course”. “But countries that have coal plants to retire need to do so more quickly, and countries that have plans for new coal plants must make sure these are never built.” Research by Capital Economics suggests China’s appetite for coal power may reduce as low-carbon options accelerate. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The report found that a resurgence in hydropower this year, combined with China’s expansion of wind, solar and nuclear power, could mark the start of a steady decline in its coal demand. Coal plant retirements were expected to pick up speed across Europe and the US this year, and fewer countries were beginning construction of new plants, Champenois said. The report found that construction started on less than 4GW of new projects outside China last year, a quarter of the annual average between 2015 and 2022 for the same set of countries.",2024-04-11T04:00:20Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/11/worlds-coal-power-capacity-rises-despite-climate-warnings,The Guardian
US and Japan announce new military agreements aimed at countering China,"Joe Biden and Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, have announced a new era of military cooperation during the pomp and pageantry of a White House state visit aimed at countering China. The US president said the two nations’ forces will cooperate on a joint command structure and, along with Australia, develop a new air missile defence network. “We’re increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way,” Biden said at a joint press conference with Kishida in the bright sunshine of the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. “This is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since it was first established. “I’m also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile and defence architecture. We’re also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.” The president, born a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that prompted US entry into the second world war, said the agreements set a “new benchmark for our military cooperation”. The move appears aimed at making US and Japanese forces more nimble in the event of a crisis such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden insisted that it was “purely defensive” and “not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region”. Kishida told reporters that the two leaders had discussed tense relations between Taiwan and China and pledged to uphold international order based on the rule of law. “We confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable,” Kishida said. The US and Japan will continue to respond to such actions, including challenges from China, he added. “Regarding Russia’s aggression of Ukraine, based on a recognition that Ukraine today may be east Asia tomorrow.” The leaders also announced deals for technology, including artificial intelligence and the economy, along with a joint partnership to accelerate development and commercialisation of nuclear fusion. Biden said they had a shared goal that a Japanese person will be the first non-American to walk on the moon, flying on a US mission due to take place in a few years’ time. Japan is taking on a more prominent global role after a series of security law changes in the past decade that have transformed its pacifist constitution. Biden also noted that Japan is the top foreign investor in the US. Overall the US and Japan have struck about 70 agreements on defence cooperation, including moves to upgrade the US military command structure in Japan, the biggest such change since the 1960s. The two sides will set up a forum for the co-development and co-production of missiles and maintenance of US warships and aircraft, as well as a working group for fighter pilot training and co-development and co-production of jet trainers. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion A joint statement said the US’s Aukus defence partnership with Australia and Britain is considering cooperation with Japan on advanced capabilities and technologies including quantum computing, undersea, hypersonic, artificial intelligence and cyber technology. Asked if there was a path for Japan to become a full member of Aukus, Kishida replied: “We want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region and therefore we have consistently supported Aukus … But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with Aukus, nothing has been decided at this moment.” Kishida is the first Japanese leader to get a US state visit since Shinzo Abe in 2015 and only the fifth world leader to receive one since Biden took office in 2021. The dinner was held in the grand East Room of the White House, decorated by fans and cherry blossom branches. White House chefs served a meal featuring Japanese flavors, starting with house-cured salmon, followed by dry-aged ribeye with wasabi sauce, and salted caramel pistachio cake with cherry ice-cream. After dinner, singer Paul Simon performed hits while playing guitar, including Graceland and Slip Slidin’ Away. Simon is one of Jill Biden’s favourite artists, according to the White House. At the dinner, Kishida quoted from the science fiction series Star Trek, telling guests “I would like to propose a toast to our voyage to the frontier of the Japan-US relationship with this word: boldly go,” a phrase from the iconic opening monologue of the TV series. Other notable guests at the dinner included Bill and Hillary Clinton and actor Robert De Niro. Kishida will address Congress on Thursday and join Biden and the Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, for a meeting expected to focus on Beijing’s South China Sea incursions. Biden also expressed support for Japan’s attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea. “We welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea,” he commented. “As I’ve said many times, we’re open to dialogue ourselves at any time but without preconditions from the DPRK.”",2024-04-10T22:03:23Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/us-japan-military-agreement,The Guardian
Appeal court judge denies Trump’s third attempt this week to delay hush money trial – as it happened,"The appeals court judge, just moments after the hearing wrapped up in New York this afternoon, has ruled against Donald Trump’s third attempt this week to delay his hush-money criminal trial Trump was denied his attempt to push back his 15 April trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, paving the way for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, Reuters reports. During an earlier hearing, Trump lawyer Emil Bove said the trial should be delayed because justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the case, has not yet ruled on their request for him to recuse himself. Bove also said Merchan was wrong to deny their request to bar prosecutors from presenting Trump’s tweets during his 2017-2021 presidential term as evidence. Bove said presidential immunity should prevent the prosecutors from presenting those posts as evidence. At the hearing before associate justice Ellen Gesmer at a mid-level state appeals court called the appellate division, Bove said: We are scheduled to begin trial under circumstances that will violate President Trump’s rights. Steven Wu, a lawyer for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, said Trump’s lawyers had brought the requests too late, saying: There is a powerful public interest in ensuring that this criminal trial go forward. An appeals court judge in New York denied Donald Trump’s third attempt in three days to delay his hush-money criminal trial. Trump was denied his attempt to push back the 15 April trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, paving the way for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president. Donald Trump said he believes the Arizona supreme court went too far with its ruling upholding a near-total abortion ban. Asked if he would sign a national abortion ban if elected president in 2024, Trump said: “No.” In response, the Biden campaign said Trump “owns the suffering and chaos happening right now” and warned that he has banned abortion “every chance he gets”. Asked what he would say to the people of Arizona, Joe Biden said: “Elect me. I’m in the … 21st century, not back then.” Biden also said he is “considering” a request from Australia to end the prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Kamala Harris will visit Arizona on Friday as part of her nationwide reproductive freedoms tour. The White House said Harris would highlight “extremists” in the state who are pushing for abortion bans during her visit. Democrats in Florida are teaming up with operatives from Biden’s re-election campaign in an all-out assault on Republicans’ extremist positions on abortion, believing it will bring victory in presidential and Senate races in November. The House voted to block the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a high-profile warrantless surveillance program that is now in limbo before a 19 April expiration date. House speaker Mike Johnson will meet on Friday with Donald Trump for a press conference on “election integrity” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, a Trump campaign official said. Johnson met with Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday, marking the first time the two have spoken since Greene filed a motion to vacate the speakership late last month. Greene described the meeting as “passionate”. The independent presidential candidate Cornel West announced that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate, joining the former Harvard professor’s long-shot bid in the US presidential race. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, told donors and supporters last weekend that he would help raise money for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, according to multiple reports. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, is accused of covering up a $130,000 hush-money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006, Reuters neatly recaps. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and denies any such encounter with Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan has not yet ruled on Trump’s motion for him to recuse himself. The defense has argued that the judge’s daughter’s work for a political consulting firm with Democratic clients poses a conflict of interest. On Monday, a judge at the appellate division denied Trump’s request to delay the case while he pursues a challenge to the trial being held in heavily Democratic Manhattan. On Tuesday, another judge rejected his bid to pause the trial while he appeals Merchan’s decision to impose a gag order restricting his public statements about potential witnesses, court staff, lawyers and family members of the judge and district attorney Alvin Bragg. Those appeals will still be heard by a full panel.

Steven Wu, a lawyer for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, said Trump’s lawyers had brought the requests too late, saying: There is a powerful public interest in ensuring that this criminal trial go forward. The hearing is over at the appeals court in New York where lawyers for Donald Trump are making the argument for the third time in three days that his hush-money criminal trial should be delayed. Jury selection will begin on Monday, so time is running out for Trump. We await the court’s decision. As colleague Cameron Joseph wrote earlier today, this follows a longstanding pattern of Trump freaking out as major threats approach, and his team responding with frenetic energy. Trump’s team throws everything it can at the wall, while Trump continues his tirade against presiding judge Juan Merchan – while pushing the bounds of the judge’s gag order.

Lawyers for Donald Trump have been back in court for almost the last hour trying to stave off the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, which begins on Monday. In a more technical legal take from NBC, the TV network explains the following: The court docket for the state Appellate Division shows Trump’s attorneys filed the challenge as a lawsuit invoking a provision of New York law known as Article 78. Article 78 challenges allow litigants, whether in ongoing litigation or otherwise, to seek relief from allegedly unlawful state or local government action. The documents were filed under seal. The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting the case, said it involved Judge Juan Merchan’s refusal to step aside from presiding over the case. Lawyers for former President Trump head back to a New York appeals court with their third legal challenge involving his impending criminal trial in three days. https://t.co/kBDIs74KWC Trump is a defendant in four criminal cases, two federal and two state. The hush-money case in New York is first up. The Georgia election interference case, the federal election interference case and the federal classified documents case do not have trial dates yet. The presidential election is on 5 November and Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, prior to his expected anointment at the Republican National Convention this summer. Donald Trump’s lawyers told a New York appeals court judge on Wednesday that the former US president’s 15 April trial should be delayed because the judge has not yet ruled on their motion for him to recuse himself, in his third last-ditch attempt so far this week to delay the case, Reuters reports. The Republican presidential candidate is accused of covering up a $130,000 hush-money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence ahead of the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and denies any such encounter with Daniels. On Monday, a judge at a mid-level state appeals court known as the appellate division denied Trump’s request to delay the case while he pursues a challenge to the trial being held in heavily Democratic Manhattan. And on Tuesday, another judge rejected his bid to pause the trial while he appeals Judge Juan Merchan’s decision to impose a gag order restricting his public statements about potential witnesses, court staff, lawyers, and family members of the judge and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg. Those appeals will still be heard by a full panel. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the trial on Monday. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, told donors and supporters last weekend that he would help raise money for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, according to multiple reports. DeSantis, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race in January, told his allies about his plans to help his former rival during a private gathering at the Hard Rock Hotel in south Florida, a DeSantis adviser told NBC News. DeSantis is “committed to helping Trump in any and every way”, said Texas businessman Roy Bailey, who attended the retreat. He said: I will follow the governor’s lead and I will do anything that he or President Trump ask me to do to help him win this election. A Trump campaign adviser said they were not aware that the Florida governor was going to start raising money for them but added that “everyone should be working towards defeating Joe Biden and electing President Trump”, NBC reported. Joe Biden, during a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, at the White House, said Japan’s attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea is “a good thing” as he reiterated his administration’s willingness for its own talks without preconditions. Biden said: We welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. As I’ve said many times, we’re open to dialogue ourselves without preconditions with the DPRK. The Biden administration has repeatedly expressed openness to talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but has never received a response. House speaker Mike Johnson will meet on Friday with Donald Trump for a press conference on “election integrity”, a Trump campaign official said. The press conference is scheduled to take place at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, AP reported, citing a source as saying that Johnson and Trump will have a “joint announcement” on Friday. NEWS w/ @KristenhCNN:  Speaker Mike Johnson is making plans to deliver a joint press conference with Donald Trump  at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, focused on ""election integrity,"" per sources.Plans still fluid, but comes as Johnson is facing a threat to his speakership from MTG. When the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, Republicans across the country cheered. Freed from Roe’s regulations, GOP lawmakers promptly blanketed the US south and midwest in near-total abortion bans. But today, after a string of electoral losses, stories of women being denied abortions and polls that confirm abortion bans remain wildly unpopular, the political calculus has changed. Republicans are now trying to slow down the car whose brakes they cut – and to convince voters that, if the car crashes, they had nothing to do with it anyway. Nowhere encapsulates the GOP’s backpedal on abortion better than Arizona, whose state supreme court on Tuesday ruled to let an 1864 near-total abortion ban go into effect. That ban, which outlaws abortion in all cases except to save the life of a woman, was passed before Arizona became a state, before the end of the civil war and before women gained the right to vote. Read the full analysis by the Guardian’s reproductive health and justice reporter: Arizona’s abortion ban is a political nightmare for Republicans in the 2024 election The House has voted to block the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a high-profile warrantless surveillance program that is now in limbo ahead of a 19 April expiration date. House Republicans have been fiercely divided over how to handle the issue, and Wednesday’s vote comes months after a similar process to reform and reauthorize the program fell apart before it even reached the House floor. The law allows the US government to collect the communications of targeted foreigners abroad by compelling service providers to produce copies of messages and internet data, or networks to intercept and turn over phone call and message data. It is controversial because it allows the government to incidentally collect messages and phone data of Americans without a court order if they interacted with the foreign target, even though the law prohibits section 702 from being used by the National Security Agency to specifically target US citizens. Joe Biden was asked what he would say to the people of Arizona following the state supreme court’s ruling to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect. The president, referring to the 1864 abortion ban which passed when Arizona was still a territory, replied: Elect me. I’m in the 20th century … 21st century … not back then. They weren’t even a state. From the Washington Post’s JM Rieger: REPORTER: On the issue of abortion, what do you say to the people of Arizona right now...?BIDEN: Elect me. I'm in the 20th century — 21st century, not back then. They weren't even a state. pic.twitter.com/0T2ASk1E0w Cornel West’s announcement that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate comes as West, an author and leftwing activist, continues his efforts to get on the ballot in every US state. West’s campaign said he had already secured ballot access in Alaska, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah, but some states require a running mate for independent candidates to get on the ballot. As part of his 50-state campaign, West announced in January that he would launch a new political party, called the Justice for All party, to help ease his path to ballot access in some states. West has no path to victory, as national polls show his support languishing in the low single digits. A survey conducted last month by the Marquette Law School found that just 4% of likely US voters named West as their preferred candidate. But West’s presence on the ballot in key battleground states could draw support away from Joe Biden, raising concerns among Democrats that the independent candidate might serve as a spoiler for the incumbent president. According to a Quinnipiac University poll of US voters conducted last month, Biden leads Donald Trump by three points, 48% to 45%, in a head-to-head match-up, but the president’s support dipped down to 38% (compared with Trump’s 39%) when third-party candidates such as West, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Jill Stein of the Green party were listed as options. The independent presidential candidate Cornel West announced on Wednesday that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate, joining the former Harvard professor’s long-shot bid in the US presidential race. Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, helped to form the LA chapter of the group Black Lives Matter, and West praised her as “one of the great freedom fighters of her generation”. West told the talkshow host Tavis Smiley on Wednesday"": I wanted somebody whose heart, mind and soul is committed to the empowerment of poor and working peoples of all colors. And Melina has a history of longevity, of putting her heart, mind, soul and body in the struggle. Abdullah told Smiley that West’s offer took her by surprise, but she quickly accepted because of her belief in his “platform of truth, love and justice”. “How can you not get behind that platform?” Abdullah said. So I’ve been following him and had been really enthusiastic about his candidacy and just was excited to be able to share space with him. Democrats in Florida are teaming up with operatives from Joe Biden’s re-election campaign in an all-out assault on Republicans’ extremist positions on abortion, believing it will bring victory in presidential and Senate races in November. They fired an opening salvo on Tuesday, tearing into Donald Trump’s “boasting” about overturning federal abortion protections a day earlier, and assailing the incumbent Republican senator Rick Scott for supporting Florida’s six-week ban that takes effect next month. Ron DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor and former candidate for the party’s presidential nomination who signed the ban into law, also found himself under fire. The Florida supreme court ruled last week that the six-week ban will take effect on 1 May, as well as allowing a ballot measure for November that could see voters enshrine the right to the procedure into law. The moves instantly propelled the state to the forefront of the national abortion debate, and allowed Democrats, all but wiped out in Florida in successive national elections, to seize on the issue as vote-winner. Biden’s campaign has released a statement following Trump’s criticism of the Arizona abortion ban, warning that he has previously “[banned] abortion every chance he gets”. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign said that Trump will enact a national abortion ban given his track record, adding that the former president “proudly overturned Roe”. Donald Trump owns the suffering and chaos happening right now, including in Arizona, because he proudly overturned Roe – something he called ‘“an incredible thing’” and ‘“pretty amazing’” just today. Trump lies constantly – about everything – but has one track record: banning abortion every chance he gets. The guy who wants to be a dictator on day one will use every tool at his disposal to ban abortion nationwide, with or without Congress, and running away from reporters to his private jet like a coward doesn’t change that reality. Greene added that Johnson asked if she was “interested” in being apart of a group of advisers for him. Green said: I said, ‘I’ll wait and see what his proposal is on that.’ Right now. he does not have my support, and I’m watching what happens with FISA and Ukraine. Greene added that she told Johnson he “failed” on the latest government spending dealing and received “a lot of excuses” in return. Rep. MTG after Johnson meeting says she explained her positions on FISA, Ukraine aid and how he “failed” them on the govt spending dealSays she got a “lot of excuses” of how that happened Greene said he discussed having a kitchen cabinet group that would be a group of advisers for him and asked her if she  “was interested.”“I said, ‘I'll wait and see what his proposal is on that.’ Right now. he does not have my support, and I'm watching what happens with FISA… https://t.co/V7LMlxGCTt The House speaker, Mike Johnson, and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have concluded their meeting, with varying descriptions on how it went. The meeting, which lasted over an hour, came after Greene filed a motion to vacate the speakership. Greene described the meeting as “passionate”, NBC News reported. When asked if the meeting was “productive”, Greene said: He’d have to completely change everything he’s done to be productive. Meanwhile, Johnson gave a more diplomatic answer, calling Greene a “friend” even as the two Republicans have differed on “strategy”. She’s a colleague. I’ve always considered her a friend … Marjorie and I don’t disagree on philosophy. We’re both conservatives. Sometimes we disagree on strategy.

Trump also said that he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected president in 2024, ABC News reported. Trump further clarified his position while speaking with reporters on Wednesday. In response to the question of if he would sign an abortion ban, Trump said “no” and shook his head. Trump says that Arizona’s abortion ruling went too far: “Yeah they did, and that will be straightened out.” Also tells @ABC he wouldn’t sign a national abortion ban as president. pic.twitter.com/wQdByVodtv The latest remarks from Trump come as Democrats have warned that he would authorize an extreme ban if elected, noting how federal abortion rights were overturned due to supreme court judges secured during Trump’s administration.",2024-04-10T21:52:52Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/apr/10/trump-biden-campaign-election-abortion-ban-latest-updates,The Guardian
Idaho teen arrested for alleged plans to attack churches in name of Islamic State,"An Idaho teenager who was allegedly planning an attack on churches in the name of Islamic State has been arrested. Last Saturday, federal authorities arrested 18-year-old Alexander Scott Mercurio of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, a day before his alleged planned attack on churches in the city using weapons including knives, firearms and fire. The federal investigation into Mercurio began when he allegedly reached out to confidential human sources online and indicated his support for IS, according to a criminal complaint. Unbeknown to him, Mercurio detailed his support to an FBI informant. In addition to spreading IS propaganda online, Mercurio allegedly solicited the terror organization’s involvement in and approval of his propaganda efforts, as well as discussed traveling from the US to join IS. In what federal authorities believe to be an online message from Mercurio to a group chat on an “encrypted social media and mobile messaging electronic communication service”, the teenager allegedly wrote in October 2022: “I’m 17 in USA…I know I try to keep secret, I’m in north Idaho very Christian and conservative parents are mad cause I’m not shaving beard and not letting pants go below ankle.” Mercurio also allegedly wrote: “Okay brother it was calm for a couple days, now its serious. They’re sending me to in person school again more therapy more stuff like that etc etc probably not coming back anytime soon. Obviously make dua, tell brothers, etc. Im in for the long haul. I gotta keep my Iman firm, no matter what. They may even send me to a ‘youth program’ (ship me off hundreds of miles to force me to ‘behave’) etv etc. Kinda scared but In Sha Allah everything will be okay, goodbye brother.” In addition to his alleged online messages, federal authorities also found “numerous files confirming Mercurio’s commitment to IS and its ideology” on his school-issued laptop. Those files allegedly include a picture of him wearing a black balaclava and holding up the number one finger, a gesture commonly used by IS supporters, as well as documents concerning the Norwegian neo-Nazi terrorist Anders Breivik, US school massacres, the suicide epidemic in Japan and Korea, as well as austerity suicides in Europe. Mercurio also allegedly considered and planned ways to support IS financially. He is accused of planning to assault his father with a metal pipe, acquire his father’s firearms and attack up to approximately 21 churches. The criminal complaint reveals that at the beginning of this year, Mercurio allegedly planned to carry out his suicide attack on a church in Coeur d’Alene on 7 April, a date “intentionally selected by him so his attack would occur before the end of Ramadan”. The complaint also says his plan involved using “flame-covered weapons”, explosives, knives, a machete, a pipe and firearms. As the date of his planned attack drew near, Mercurio also allegedly devised a plan to incapacitate his father, restrain him with handcuffs and steal his firearms “to use for maximum casualties in his attack”. In planning the attack, Mercurio also allegedly made a ba’yah, or an Islamic pledge of allegiance, to IS and stated his intention to die while killing others in the name of the terror organization. In a statement released following Mercurio’s arrest, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said: “Thanks to the investigative efforts of the FBI, the defendant was taken into custody before he could act, and he is now charged with attempting to support Isis’s mission of terror and violence. The justice department will continue to relentlessly pursue, disrupt, and hold accountable those who would commit acts of terrorism against the people and interests of the United States.” Echoing similar sentiments, Shohini Sinha, special agent in charge of the Salt Lake City FBI, said: “This case should be an eye-opener to the dangers of self-radicalization, which is a real threat to our communities. Protecting the American people from terrorism remains the FBI’s number one priority, and we continue to encourage the public to report anything suspicious to the FBI or your local law enforcement.” Mercurio is charged with attempting to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, Mercurio faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison.",2024-04-10T19:26:31Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/idaho-isis-teen-attack,The Guardian
"Aggressive use of state subsidies risks expensive trade wars, IMF warns","Aggressive use of industrial policy by the world’s most powerful economies risks becoming an expensive mistake that could trigger a tit-for-tat subsidy war, the International Monetary Fund has said. In a warning shot to governments around the world, the IMF said attempts to increase innovation only worked under certain limited conditions and were not a “magic cure” for slow growth. Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department, said: “History shows that getting industrial policy right can be a tall order, and there are many cautionary tales of policy mistakes, high fiscal costs and negative spillovers to other countries.” It comes as leading western governments adopt an increasingly interventionist approach to boosting economic growth, gradually turning away from a reliance on the private sector, low taxes and the light-touch regulation built up over the past four decades. In a sign of increasing tensions over industrial policy, Beijing has accused the EU of protectionism after Brussels launched a subsidy investigation into Chinese wind turbine companies. “China is highly concerned about the discriminatory measures taken by the European Union against Chinese companies and even industries,” the country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. The EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, announced an investigation on Tuesday into whether Chinese companies involved in wind farms across Europe may have benefited from support from Beijing. While careful to avoid singling out any country for criticism, the IMF used a chapter from its half-yearly fiscal monitor to express scepticism about the benefits claimed for industrial strategies and urged rich countries to concentrate on support for underfunded basic research. It said recent initiatives – such as the Chips Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the US, the Green Deal Industrial Plan in the EU, the New Direction on Economy and Industrial Policy in Japan, and the K-Chips Act in Korea – as well as longstanding policies in large emerging market economies such as China were alike in having a strong emphasis on innovation in specific sectors. Most packages involve governments offering tax and subsidy incentives for investment in green and advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Dabla-Norris said the resurgence in industrial policy was motivated by concerns about economic and energy security, and the hope that it would re-ignite productivity growth, which has been weak in many parts of the world since the global financial crisis of 2008. Using industrial policy to promote innovation was only worth it if the benefits could be well identified and measured, and the subsidies were provided to sectors that generated higher knowledge spillovers to other sectors, Dabla-Norris said. Gains could be particularly high in the case of innovation that accelerated the development of green technologies to lower carbon emissions. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion However, she feared activist government policies could lead to “misallocation of resources and capture by special interests”, because most approaches relied heavily on costly subsidies. “Potential gains could quickly run into sizeable losses,” she said. “Further, we show that discriminating against foreign firms can actually prove self-defeating, as such policies can trigger costly retaliation in most countries. Even major advanced economies rely on innovation that is done elsewhere.” The IMF said in technologically advanced economies, a more cost-effective way to increase innovation and growth was a mix of public funding for fundamental research, research and development grants for innovative startups, and tax incentives to encourage applied innovation across firms. “We estimate that increasing spending on these policies by 0.5 percentage points of gross domestic product – or about 50% of the current level in OECD economies – could raise GDP by up to 2% for the average advanced economy. That level of spending on innovation could even reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the long term.”",2024-04-10T13:30:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/10/industrial-policy-to-boost-innovation-not-magic-cure-for-slow-growth-imf-warns,The Guardian
Eric Abetz handed senior Tasmanian cabinet roles – as it happened,"We’re going to leave it here for the day. Here’s what happened: Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff has reached an agreement with the Jacqui Lambie Network to form government, with JLN members Miriam Beswick, Andrew Jenner, and Rebekah Pentland agreeing to provide confidence to his government on a number of measures. Former federal Coalition senator Eric Abetz has been named Tasmanian minister for business, industry and resources, which includes salmon and forestry. Abetz will also be minister for transport, and the leader of the government in the lower house. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has said “we are seeing breakouts of strategic disorder across the globe” and accused the Albanese government of being “weak at articulating the threats we face”. A Melbourne council in the city’s west says asbestos has been discovered at Altona Coastal Park, as the discovery of contaminated material spreads to seven parks across the city. Thanks for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow to take you through all the news Thursday has to offer. The conservative Liberal will have responsibility for contentious salmon farms and native forest logging in Tasmania after being appointed to senior roles in Jeremy Rockliff‘s new cabinet. The former federal Coalition senator has been named the state minister for business, industry and resources, which includes salmon and forestry. Abetz will also be minister for transport, and the leader of the government in the lower house as the Rockliff government attempts to navigate a parliament in which it holds only 14 of 35 seats. The announcement of the cabinet followed the Liberals reaching an agreement with the state’s three new Jacqui Lambie Network MPs - Miriam Beswick, Andrew Jenner and Rebekah Pentland. JLN promised to back the Liberals on confidence and censure votes that did not involve “malfeasance or corruption” and guaranteed to support all budget bills. The minor party also said it would give the government notice if it intended to vote against any of its legislation, and then vote for an adjournment so the parties could negotiate. Rockliff still needs a deal on confidence votes with at least one of the state’s three independent MPs – Craig Garland, Kristie Johnston and David O’Byrne – to reach the 18 votes needed in parliament. Greens leader calls on government to ‘immediately recognise Palestine’ Posting on social media site X, Adam Bandt also said the government should “end military exports and stop military contracts with Israel, and stop backing the invasion”. The Labor government should immediately recognise Palestine.Labor must also end military exports & stop military contracts with Israel, and stop backing the invasion.No need to wait. There’s no barrier to this happening right now. Qatar Airways avoids Australian lawsuit The airline has dodged legal action over an incident at Doha airport in which women were forcibly removed from planes by armed guards and some intimately examined. However, while the federal court dismissed the case against the airline, justice John Halley determined the five Australian women bringing the case could instead re-plead their claims for damages against Matar, a Qatar Airways-owned subsidiary engaged by the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) to run Doha airport. The five women initiated legal action against the airline in 2022, later adding the QCAA and Matar to the case over the incident in October 2020, seeking damages over “unlawful physical contact”, false imprisonment and mental health impacts, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. They were among more than a dozen passengers who were escorted off the Sydney-bound Qatar Airways plane by armed guards as authorities searched for the mother of a newborn baby found abandoned in a plastic bag at Hamad international airport. The infant survived. The women were taken to ambulances on the tarmac and some were forced to submit to invasive examinations for evidence they had recently given birth. The lawsuit claims one passenger was forced to undergo a strip-search holding her five-month-old son. Tammy Tyrrell, the Tasmanian senator who spectacularly quit the Jacqui Lambie Network before the Easter weekend, has likened the deterioration of her relationship with Lambie and the minor party to a marriage breakdown. Tyrell told ABC on Wednesday afternoon she had made the decision to “rip the Band-Aid off and separate” with the minor party after it became clear they were no longer happy with her. “If someone is not happy in a relationship, and it is made obvious they are not happy with the way the other person in the relationship is representing them, someone has to make a decision. I said before that the people of Tasmania are the children in this relationship and they will be looked after fabulously.” Asked whether there was tension or a “blow up” between the two Tasmanians, Tyrell said she would not speak badly about the senator she once worked for as an office manager. I would love to say there was a huge drama but, in any relationship, there are highs and lows and in all honesty, we’re not really in a low, we are just travelling the course of our relationship. Jacqui and I wish each other well. We’re not going to do anything different in that we are going to try and get the best for Tasmania with the legislation. We will work together moving forward. And I will never speak badly about them. Tyrell was also asked about the role of the minor party’s board in her resignation. The now independent senator said there was nothing murky about the board she had sat on before resigning. We are new to the political game but we were not silly so we knew we had to make sure that the network was protected and a board was created. But if you speak to Jacqui or another senator I am sure they would be happy to explain more. Barnaby Joyce is criticising delays in implementing a new system of compensation and rehabilitation for veterans, the draft legislation of which he says was initially meant to be released in 2023. He says the legislation, which is meant to combine the three current acts that govern these issues – the veterans entitlement act, the military act, and defence rehabilitation act – “was supposed to go through or be complete in 2025. Now they are saying it won’t be complete until 2026. They might not even be the government then.” Joyce says it’s important that Australians know the context of this issue, in understanding his frustration: Since 1997 about 1600 Australian ex-servicemen and women have committed suicide … If that happened in a number of plane crashes, we will be having royal commission after royal commission, so this is incredibly important. These people have served our nation. Joyce calls for peace before statehood discussion on Israel and Palestine Barnaby Joyce has said “it’s not the right time and it’s not the place” to be having a discussion about recognising a Palestinian state. “The only thing we should be discussing is how we bring about peace,” he has told the ABC. At this point in time, Gaza is run by a terrorist organisation called Hamas and so a plan to create a separate terrorist state, how does that work? Obviously we would want, as things progress, for Israel and the Palestinians to come to an arrangement which brings peace over the longer term and that’s what everybody wants … Nobody wants what is happening there at the moment. It is a complete and utter human tragedy but the source of this, the instigator of this, was a terrorist organisation and you cannot start saying I’m going to open up negotiations with a terrorist organisation. Is Australia going to have diplomatic relations with a terrorist organisation representatives of the Gaza Strip? Concern among LGBTQ+ groups about Cass review findings into trans healthcare practices in UK The findings of a major review of trans healthcare practices in the UK have been met with deep concern by Australian LGBTQ+ organisations, with “caution and care” urged in local interpretations of it. The Cass review – named for Dr Hilary Cass, the paediatrician commissioned to conduct a review of the services provided by the UK health system to children and young people exploring their gender identity – found gender medicine was “built on shaky foundations” and that there was a dearth of robust data in the field. Representatives from Equality Australia, the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH), Acon, the Trans Justice Project and more, said the review “ignores the consensus of major medical bodies around the world and lacks relevance within an Australian context”. The director of community health at Acon, Teddy Cook, said: Trans people everywhere should have access to the highest attainable level of health through a robust, evidence based, multi-disciplinary and affirming approach, an approach that demonstrably saves trans lives. In ignoring key evidence and research, the Cass review does not meet that standard and has today let down the very people, families, health providers and communities it seeks to support. LGBTIQ+ Health Australia has urged local institutions to “hold the report at arm’s length” and ensure that it is not used “to drive extremist responses … that do more harm than good” to trans healthcare, such as the withdrawal of puberty blockers from trans and gender-diverse young people. LGBTIQ+ Health Australia chief executive Nicky Bath said: The report itself acknowledges that the review is marred by poor quality data and flawed methodologies, which in and of itself, calls into question the validity of the report’s conclusions … We call on the Australian government to stand by trans and gender diverse young people, listen to them, their families, organisations and clinicians and resist the pressure that will come to withdraw access to puberty blockers and instead support affirming care practices that respects children-centred care, the autonomy and dignity of transgender and gender-diverse people. Claims flowing in to insurance firms Insurers have received 11,527 claims to date from last weekend’s severe storm in New South Wales, the Insurance Council of Australia has reported. Most of these claims related to damage to buildings and contents as a result of wind and heavy rain causing gutters to overflow and flash flooding to occur. The ICA said that at this stage it was too early to estimate the insurance damage bill, which most severely affected the Hawkesbury-Nepean and Illawarra regions of New South Wales. The ICA’s advice to people whose property has been affected by storm-related damage is: If property or a vehicle have been affected, customers are advised to contact their insurer as soon as possible to commence the claims process even if they do not know the full extent of damage. Insurance customers are not required to keep destroyed property, including carpets and furnishings, and should instead take photos, note any identifying information, and keep materials samples. New data also released today shows that losses from declared insurance catastrophes this summer have reached close to $1.6bn, with the cost of the Christmas storms now exceeding $1.1bn. What did Penny Wong say about recognising Palestinian statehood – and is Australia at odds with its allies? The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said a “pathway out of the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East can only come with recognition of “a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel”. Some commentators have interpreted the speech as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term. So what did Wong actually say about a two-state solution, what was she silent about, and how does this fit in with what Australia’s allies are doing? Daniel Hurst has this excellent explainer: Icac concludes probe of former Labor minister’s conduct The New South Wales corruption watchdog has ended its investigation into former Labor minister Tim Crakanthorp after concluding there were “no reasonable prospects” of finding his conduct corrupt. Crakanthorp was sacked from cabinet last August after it was revealed the Newcastle MP had allegedly failed to declare “substantial private family holdings” relating to his wife’s family. Neither Crakanthorp’s wife nor her family were accused of any wrongdoing. The premier, Chris Minns, referred the matter to the Independent Commission Against Corruption after asking Crakanthorp to resign as a minister after he became aware of the properties across the Hunter region, for which he was the minister. A spokesperson for the Icac on Wednesday said: As the Commission is satisfied that there are no reasonable prospects of finding Mr Crakanthorp’s conduct is sufficiently serious to justify a finding of corrupt conduct, it has terminated its investigation. Hi, Kate Lyons here, I’ll be taking you through the rest of the day’s news. To start us off, AAP have an update after the late-breaking news yesterday that Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art have lost a legal battle over its Ladies Lounge exhibit. The artist behind the Ladies Lounge said she is deeply saddened after the exhibit was found to be unlawful. A case was brought against the operators of Mona in the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal by Jason Lau, who was refused access to the lounge, because only women are allowed entry. The Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal decision ruled on Tuesday that Kirsha Kaechele’s artwork may have had a point but violated the law. The women-only, curtained-off lounge now has 28 days to allow “persons who do not identify as ladies” access to the installation. Ms Kaechele posted on Instagram on Wednesday that she was “saddened by the court’s ruling against the Ladies Lounge”. “But, by grace of due process, I have been granted a 28-day period. This allows me space to absorb the situation, seek counsel and compose myself,” she wrote. “I am so grateful for your ongoing understanding and support through one of the most difficult periods of my life. Such periods can be painful, as many of us know.” A MONA spokesperson said the museum is taking time to figure out its next steps. “We are deeply disappointed by this decision. We will take some time to absorb the result and consider our options,” she said. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Kate Lyons will be here to guide you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care! China calls US remarks on Taiwan ‘very dangerous’ Reuters is reporting some pushback from China on the Aukus deal, particularly where it comes to discussions surrounding Taiwan. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office has called remarks made by the US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell dangerous, after he suggested Aukus could help deter any Chinese move against Taiwan. “His remarks are very dangerous,” said spokesperson Zhu Fenglian when responding to a question at a weekly press conference. The establishment of the so-called trilateral security partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia is essentially to provoke military confrontation in the region through military cooperation in small circles. Campbell, who made a rare link between Taiwan and Aukus, told Washington’s Center for a New American Security thinktank that new submarine capabilities would enhance peace and stability, including in the strait that separates China and Taiwan. Zhu: Any attempt to use relevant military cooperation to intervene in the Taiwan issue is to interfere in China’s internal affairs, violate the one-China principle, and endanger peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We firmly oppose. Wong on two-state solution for Israel Palestine There’s been much discussion today about a speech Penny Wong gave last night, suggesting support for a Palestinian state may provide a pathway to a two-state solution. The foreign minister said the recognition of a Palestinian state would help ensure long-term security for Israel, and further undermine Hamas.

US defense secretary rejects Israel genocide accusations; Blinken and Cameron urge US House to pass Ukraine aid - as it happened,"The US has seen no evidence that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said. Austin, addressing a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing today, said: We don’t have any evidence of genocide being created. He also avoided referring to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October as a genocide, calling it a “horrific terrorist attack” and “certainly … a war crime”. Austin’s testimony was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding the war. A protester interrupted Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin during a Senate hearing on the Defense Dept.'s budget, calling for a cease-fire in Gaza as they were removed from the room by police. pic.twitter.com/JRdzFBTwL0 Arizona’s supreme court ruled to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect. The justices said Arizona could enforce a 1864 near-total abortion ban that went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade. Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said Tuesday was a “dark day” for the state and implored abortion rights supporters to make their voices heard in November. Joe Biden criticized the Arizona supreme court ruling, blaming “the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women’s freedom” and calling the ban “cruel”. Kamala Harris, in response to the ruling by the Arizona supreme court, said the state had “rolled back the clock to a time before women could vote”, and said Donald Trump was resopnsible for the ruling. Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday. Secretary of state Antony Blinken and his UK counterpart, foreign secretary David Cameron, urged Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine after talks in Washington during a joint press conference following talks in Washington on Tuesday. Blinken said the supplemental budget request that the president has made of Congress is “urgent” and should be taken to a vote “as quickly as possible”. Victory for Ukraine is “vital for American and European security”, Cameron said. Cameron also met with Trump over dinner on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. During the briefing with Blinken, Cameron defended the meeting as a standard encounter with an opposition figure and said it covered a number of pressing global issues but did not elaborate. “These things are entirely proper,” he said. Trump’s campaign said the former president and Cameron discussed the Ukraine war and “the need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements”. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the US has seen “no evidence” that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Austin addressed a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing and was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding Israel’s war in Gaza. A New York appeals court judge rejected the latest bid by Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Republican far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. Kamala Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday just days after the state’s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban. The vice president’s trip to Arizona, her second this year, was already in the works prior to Tuesday’s court decision and will likely take on a heightened focus on abortion rights and access, Politico reported. The White House said Harris will use her visit “to continue her leadership in the fight for reproductive freedoms”. Fifteen prominent historians filed an amicus brief with the supreme court, rejecting Donald Trump’s claim in his federal election subversion case that he is immune to criminal prosecution for acts committed as president. Authorities cited in the document include the founders Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Adams, in addition to the historians’ own work. Trump, the historians said, “asserts that a doctrine of permanent immunity from criminal liability for a president’s official acts, while not expressly provided by the constitution, must be inferred. To justify this radical assertion, he contends that the original meaning of the constitution demands it. But no plausible historical case supports his claim. Despite widespread legal and historical opinion that Trump’s immunity claim is groundless, the supreme court, to which Trump appointed three justices, will consider the claim. Oral arguments are scheduled for 25 April. The court recently dismissed attempts, supported by leading historians, to remove Trump from ballots under the 14th amendment, passed after the civil war to bar insurrectionists from office. As we reported earlier, defense secretary Lloyd Austin told the Senate earlier today that the US government has seen “no evidence” that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Austin addressed a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing and was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding Israel’s war in Gaza. The UK also confirmed in meetings with US counterparts that there would be no changes to arms exports to Israel, although it would be kept under review. Here’s the clip: Louisiana’s Republican-controlled senate advanced a bill on Monday that would empower state and local law enforcement to arrest and jail people in the state who entered the US illegally, similar to embattled legislation in Texas. Amid national fights between Republican states and Joe Biden over how and who should enforce the US-Mexico border, Louisiana joins a growing list of legislatures seeking to expand states’ authority over border enforcement. Proponents of the bill, such as the legislation’s author, GOP state senator Valarie Hodges, say Louisiana has the “right to defend our nation”. Hodges has accused the federal government of neglecting responsibilities to enforce immigration law, an argument heard from GOP leaders across the country. Opponents argue the bill is unconstitutional, will not do anything to make the state safer, and will only fuel negative and false rhetoric directed toward migrants. Across the nation, reliably red legislatures have advanced tougher immigration enforcement measures. The Oklahoma house passed a bill that would prohibit state revenue from being used to provide benefits to those living in the state illegally. A bill in Tennessee, which is awaiting the governor’s signature, would require law enforcement agencies in the state to communicate with federal immigration authorities if they discover people who are in the country illegally. Measures that mirror parts of the Texas law are awaiting the governor’s signature in Iowa, while another is pending in Idaho’s statehouse. Lawmakers and climate advocates called on utilities to “ditch the American Gas Association” at a press conference at the US Capitol on Tuesday. “Americans are already paying the price of climate change,” said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. They shouldn’t have to pay the salaries of those who are fueling it. A trade association representing more than 200 US utilities, the AGA has a well-documented history of lobbying against climate regulations and policies – activity funded in part by members’ ratepayers’ utility bills. It’s a “dirty game,” said Xavier Boatwright of the Sierra Club. Both the event and a protest outside the AGA’s headquarters earlier Tuesday were led by the anti-gas nonprofit organization the Gas Leaks Project. “There’s nothing natural about natural gas,” said the group’s senior communications director Maria Luisa Cesar. The extraction and use of gas, called natural gas by industry interests, emits planet-heating and toxic pollution. Reports show the AGA has been aware of these dangers for 50 years, but has continued to undercut climate efforts. Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse said: The fossil fuel industry depends in roughly equal parts on hydrocarbons and lies. In August, the New England utility Eversource cut ties with the American Gas Association. Advocates are calling on other utilities to follow its lead. Four states have also passed legislation to prevent the use of ratepayer dollars to fund political activity. Also in Arizona, Eva Burch, a Democratic state lawmaker who drew national attention after announcing her decision to seek an abortion earlier this month, said today’s court decision to enforce a ban - using a law that was originally drafted in the 19th Century before women could vote and before Arizona was a state - would have devastating consequences for women such as her. “A couple of weeks ago I had an abortion – a safe legal abortion here in Arizona for a pregnancy that I very much wanted,” Burch said. Somebody gave me a procedure so that I wouldn’t have to experience another miscarriage – the pain, the mess, the discomfort. And now we’re talking about whether or not we should put that doctor in jail. This is outrageous. Burch predicted the ruling would backfire on conservatives who have fought to allow the ban to be enforced. “The people of Arizona have had enough,” Burch said. We are electing pro-choice candidates in November. Watch it happen. Kamala Harris has responded to a ruling by the Arizona supreme court to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect, saying the state had “rolled back the clock to a time before women could vote”. In a statement, the vice president said there was “one person responsible” for the ruling, which will allow a law first passed in 1864 to go into effect, “by his own admission … Donald Trump”. Harris said the “extreme and dangerous” ban criminalizes almost all abortion care in the state and “puts women’s lives at risk”, adding: It’s a reality because of Donald Trump, who brags about being ‘proudly the person responsible’ for overturning Roe v. Wade, and made it possible for states to enforce cruel bans. She added: The alarm is sounding for every woman in America: if he has the opportunity, Donald Trump would sign off on a national abortion ban. He has called for punishing women and doctors. If he wins, he and his allies have plans to ban abortion and restrict access to birth control, with or without Congress. Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, called today’s news from the state’s supreme court on an abortion ban a “dark day” for the state and implored abortion rights supporters to make their voices heard in November. Hobbs vowed to do everything in her power to preserve access to reproductive care and contraception in the state, pointing to actions she has already taken. After winning the election in 2022, Hobbs last year issued a sweeping executive order banning county attorneys from prosecuting women who seek abortions and doctors who perform them. Asked about the possibility that her directive could be challenged in court, Hobbs said: “Bring it on.” At the news conference, held moments after the state supreme court released its decision, Hobbs called on the Republican-led state legislature to “immediately” repeal the ban. But the legislature is unlikely to do so. The leaders of both chambers joined anti-abortion activists in favor of allowing the territorial-era ban to take effect. “The legislature has ignored the will of the voters on this issue for decades,” she said. The ballot box is the way that voters can have their say and overrule the legislature on this issue that the vast majority of Arizonans support. It is a dark day in Arizona. We are just fourteen days away from one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country.But my message to Arizona women is this: I won't rest, and I won't stop fighting until we have secured the right to abortion.That is my promise to you. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just said that US government agencies were still involved in an “informal review” of the Israel Defense Forces’ review of the killing by the Israeli military of seven aid workers with the group World Central Kitchen in Gaza earlier this month. Sullivan said that the CIA director, Bill Burns, was involved in further talks in Cairo in Egypt at the weekend, where states such as the US and Qatar are trying to broker a ceasefire in Israel’s war in Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages held by Hamas since the massacre it perpetrated in southern Israel last 7 October. Sullivan said the US “has seen Israel take some steps forward” in the talks, while the latest statements from Hamas were regarded as “less than encouraging”. He said more humanitarian aid was reaching Gaza, which he said was “good, but not good enough”, amid Israel’s blockade and siege of the Palestinian territory. And amid Israel pulling troops out of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, in a pause in its offensive actions, Sullivan said the US has still not seen “a credible and executable” plan from Israel about what it would do to move or protect Palestinians in the event that, as it has pledged to do, it invades Rafah. Joe Biden has just arrived back at the White House after a very short trip to Washington’s main Union Station rail hub, to deliver remarks about healthcare. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was originally due to brief the media at 1.30pm in the regular daily session in the west wing, but obviously everything is being pushed back because the president’s schedule shifted later than originally expected, also. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will join the briefing. It’s getting underway now. We’ll bring you highlights from the briefing. There has been a lot of international-facing news today, especially with the latest on high-level talks in the Middle East about Israel’s war in Gaza and US secretary of state Antony Blinken and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron meeting in Washington, DC, and urging the US Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine. Joe Biden has criticized the Arizona supreme court ruling from earlier today to let an old law on the books banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect – albeit with a 14-day delay to allow further legal challenges before it does. The US president blamed “the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women’s freedom” and called the ban “cruel”. In a statement issued from the White House moments ago, Biden said: “Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest. This cruel ban was first enacted in 1864 – more than 150 years ago, before Arizona was even a state and well before women had secured the right to vote.” The statement ended with: “Vice-President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose. We will continue to fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade for women in every state.” Kamala Harris has taken a strong lead in recent months on efforts by the Biden administration and the Biden-Harris re-election campaign to win support for protecting reproductive rights. This follows, in particular, the landmark overturning of the federal right to abortion by the conservative-dominated supreme court in 2022 and further attacks on rights ranging from abortion pills to contraception to IVF by the hard right. The Arizona supreme court ruled on Tuesday to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect, a decision that could curtail abortion access in the US south-west and could make Arizona one of the biggest battlefields in the 2024 electoral fight over abortion rights. The justices said Arizona could enforce a 1864 near-total abortion ban, first passed before Arizona became a state, that went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade. However, the justices also ruled to hold off on requiring the state to enforce the ban for 14 days, in order to allow advocates to ask a lower court to pause it again. The ban can only be enforced “prospectively”, according to the 4-2 ruling. Minutes after the ruling Kris Mayes, Arizona’s Democratic attorney general, vowed not to prosecute any doctors or women under the 1864 ban. You can read the full story here. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, urged Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine after talks in Washington. Blinken and Cameron held a joint press conference where the US secretary of state said the stalled Ukraine funding is critical for US, European and world security. The supplemental budget request that Joe Biden has made of Congress is “urgent” and should be taken to a vote “as quickly as possible”, Blinken said. Victory for Ukraine is “vital for American and European security”, Cameron said. Cameron also met with Donald Trump over dinner on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. During the briefing with Blinken, Cameron defended the meeting as a standard encounter with an opposition figure and said it covered a number of pressing global issues but did not elaborate. “These things are entirely proper,” he said. Trump’s campaign said the former president and Cameron discussed the Ukraine war and “the need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements”. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, told a Senate armed services committee hearing that the US has seen no evidence that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. A New York appeals court judge rejected the latest bid by Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Republican far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. There’s a key US Senate race in Ohio this year, where the incumbent leftwing Democrat, Sherrod Brown, is expected to face a tough challenge from Bernie Moreno, a car dealer turned Trump-backed populist firebrand. Like many Trump-backed candidates, Moreno is making it his business to blame China for woes affecting blue-collar workers. Earlier this year, he went so far as to tell a conservative radio host: “The Buick Envision was made in China, I told General Motors I wouldn’t sell one of them, don’t even ship it to me.” The problem about the claim, which Moreno has made elsewhere, is that as Spectrum News reports … “Moreno’s dealership did sell the Chinese-made SUVs for several years, and even promoted the vehicles on social media, according to numerous social media posts.” After detailing such posts, Spectrum adds: “GM, the parent company of Buick, confirmed to Spectrum News the Envision was only manufactured in China. The SUV became the first Chinese-made vehicle to be imported by a major US automaker when it debuted in Michigan in 2016. The imports were called a “slap in the face” by the United Auto Workers union, which felt the vehicles should be made on US soil by American workers. A spokesperson for Moreno, Reagan McCarthy, told Spectrum: “In response to the closure of the Lordstown Plant here in Ohio [in March 2019], Bernie made a decision to stop any new inventory of Envision’s [sic] from being sold at his dealership. After he sold off the inventory he already had on the lot, he refused to take orders for more Envisions. There is zero contradiction here.” There are contradictions elsewhere in Moreno’s campaign statements, though, as the Guardian discussed here: A New York appeals court judge has rejected the latest bid by Donald Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Trump’s lawyers had requested the trial to be postponed indefinitely while he appeals a gag order that bars him from commenting about jurors, witnesses and others connected to the case. Trump’s attorneys argue that Justice Juan Merchan’s order restricting his public comments is an unconstitutional prior restraint on his free speech rights while he campaigns for president. Merchan imposed the order last month after finding Trump made statements in various legal cases that the judge called “threatening, inflammatory” and “denigrating”. During the hearing on Tuesday, Trump’s lawyer Emil Bove said: The First amendment harms arising from this gag order right now are irreparable. Justice Cynthia Kern issued the order following a Tuesday morning hearing, but a full panel of appeals judges will later consider the former president’s underlying challenge to the gag order. Austin, asked what the consequences of a deadly mass famine in Gaza would be, said: It will accelerate violence, and it will have the effect of ensuring that there’s a long-term conflict. Addressing the Senate armed services committee, the defense secretary added: It doesn’t have to happen ... We should continue to do everything we can, and we are doing this, to encourage the Israelis to provide humanitarian assistance.",2024-04-09T20:04:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/apr/09/trump-biden-election-campaign-updates-congress-ukraine,The Guardian
"To boost birthrates, we must give women the freedom of choice | Letters","Prof Devi Sridhar’s fine article gives a broad overview of a critical issue facing humanity that is far too often avoided: overpopulation (When desperate measures to persuade women to have children fail, it’s time for fresh thinking, 2 April). She gives sub-Saharan Africa as an example, but the issue applies globally. We are over 8 billion people on a planet that scientists estimate could sustainably support around 2 billion at a modest western living standard. Yes, fertility rates – the number of children a woman gives birth to – are falling, but too slowly. The world’s population is still rising by 80 million every year, each of whom will need food, water, accommodation and more, when these are already in short supply. Prof Sridhar calls for a more sympathetic view on immigration – a good call, but no solution to overpopulation. Instead, we should give more support to the excellent work being done by charities in sub-Saharan Africa. They are freeing girls from the cultural norm of having a large family by providing them with school places, often available only to boys. One survey found that providing girls with secondary school education dropped their fertility rate from the traditional six or seven to four, coupled with opportunities to find employment. Girls supported through tertiary education later had on average just two children. Richard VernonOxford  I have no disagreement with Devi Sridhar’s point about immigration. But when discussing falling birthrates, she only briefly mentions the obstacles to having children, focusing instead on women’s freedom of choice. She talks of women being able “to make choices based on the kind of happy life they want to live”, and that “it’s now acceptable and feasible … to decide against child-raising”. Even setting aside the fact that, historically, contraceptives were more widespread and family sizes smaller than we assume, these points about women’s choices are certainly true. But I am struck by how much my peers describe a lack of freedom. What Prof Sridhar fails to express are the ways in which those obstacles to child-raising, rarely addressed by government incentives, significantly impact women’s freedom of reproductive choice. I know many women who want another child, but find it all but impossible because of the impact on their careers, their finances, their bodies and their families. Having only one or two children might appear to be a victory of choice and access to contraceptives, but the reality is that those obstacles make it hard for women to have the children they desire. It is no coincidence that South Korea, which is failing to raise its birthrate, ranks at the bottom of the Economist’s list of working conditions for women. If people were truly able to “make choices based on the kind of happy life they want”, it would mean the freedom to decide not just against child-raising but also for child-raising. Robyn Boeré Oslo, Norway  I appreciate Devi Sridhar pointing out that declining fertility rates are a success story reflecting women gaining more choices over their bodies and lives. The trend towards smaller families is not a new one, and it has never been something to lament, but media outlets around the world sadly continue to portray it as a crisis. The panic over the economic impacts of smaller populations is absurd when you consider that the alternative – continuous population growth on a finite planet – can only lead to disaster. The UN projects that we are on track for 10 billion people by the 2050s, which will make it increasingly difficult to end environmental degradation and avert the worst outcomes of the climate crisis. Let’s be honest: a people shortage is the opposite of our problem. Prof Sridhar rightly points to immigration as a neglected policy solution that can help counter the effects of population ageing. Better preventive healthcare to keep older citizens fit and healthy for as long as possible is another one. So is investing in children’s health and education, improving their wellbeing and the odds that they’ll eventually become productive members of the workforce. We also need to recognise the many socioeconomic benefits of reduced population pressure, such as lower housing costs and less competition for jobs. Instead of fighting low birthrates, let’s plan for a more sustainable future by prioritising people over profits and ensuring that women everywhere are free to choose their family size.Olivia NaterPopulation Connection, Washington DC, US  Prof Devi Sridhar underlines what many women have known for years – this manufactured panic about falling birthrates is little more than misogyny, with a heap of racism thrown in for good measure. If a simple lack of working-age population were really the problem, immigration from countries with a growing fertility rate is an obvious salve. But for some reason, no one wants to acknowledge that. Victoria Williams London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For 30 years I saw my kidnapping as character-building – until I finally faced what happened to me | Anna Broinowski,"In the scorching summer of 1987, young, invincible and hungry for adventure, I left my cloistered life at the University of Sydney to hitchhike to Darwin. I wanted to discover the “real” Australia, that classless utopia of rugged, self-made blokes in the Foster’s ads; the quixotic outback of explorers and mavericks celebrated by Xavier Herbert and Patrick White. Hitchhiking for art was a masculine pursuit, mythologised by Jack Kerouac and the beatniks. I wanted to update their 60s machismo with some brazenly female 80s cool. I would document my 8,000km trip, return to Sydney unscathed, and write a novel. Or so I thought. My companion, Andrew Peisley, and I hit the highway at Lithgow, armed with a tarp, seven books and a guitar. We’d survive on Peisley’s dole cheque and busk for counter-meals in pubs along the way. We agreed to remain platonic, accept every lift that got us closer to Darwin, and never split up. Four days in, at a Cunnamulla roadhouse, our rules imploded. I was kidnapped by truckies. Four of them, driving two road trains in convoy. They couldn’t fit us both in one truck so they offered to take me in the first and Peisley in the second. I climbed, just as Kerouac would, into the first rig and we drove off. But when Peisley approached the second truck, the driver slammed the door in his face. For five hours up a desolate stretch of the Simpson known as Death Highway, the truckies faked conversations on their two-way to convince me Peisley was in the second truck. They were drunk and high on ox blood, a trucker amphetamine. They made me drive the road train, force fed me pills, stripped and assaulted me. Gang-rape, perhaps something worse, was on the cards. Through stubbornness, arrogance and a miraculous stroke of luck, I survived. A random driver dropped Peisley at the Augathella turnoff, just when my abductors stopped for a rest. We escaped into the bush, made it to Darwin and had a magnificent adventure. I filed away my kidnapping as a useful character-building exercise and got on with life. If I had PTSD, I didn’t notice. I didn’t identify as a victim. I didn’t describe the ordeal in detail to others, or cry. When a friend asked if I’d been scared, I insisted, “No, I was furious!” As a gen X-er I discovered feminism in the 80s, when Thatcher and Reagan rejected collectivist civil rights in favour of profit-focused individualism. Women’s lib and bra burners were on the nose. For young, aspirational women like me, there was a palpable sense we had to compete with each other to climb up the pole. We navigated the daily hurdles of sexism alone, proud of our ability to not complain and get things done. For 30 years I thought I was unscarred, until Alyssa Milano’s groundbreaking 2017 tweet popped on to my feed: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ … ” I normally rejected invitations to overshare as narcissistic but this time I felt compelled to reply: “1. the truckies who kidnapped me hitching to darwin 2. the film producer who asked to see my breasts in an audition 3. the man who stalked me in newtown and watched me shower 4. the men who whispered filthy things on the street even when I hid my body 5. the men who have started to look at my teenage daughter the same way – watch out.” Milano’s hashtag was retweeted 1m times with 12m Facebook reposts in less than two days – with many stories more horrific than mine. With two words, #MeToo created a digital sisterhood. It resurrected the mass activism of the second-wave feminists, reclaiming the collective voice the 80s backlash against “angry feminism” had erased and turbo-charging it across the globe. #MeToo’s 24 million contributors proved the misogyny we’d battled in private was endemic, part of a patriarchal power structure that divided us to remain intact. In 2019 I drove my daughter to Darwin to retrace my 80s hitchhiking trip, curious if the outback misogyny I’d encountered was still there. We found decency and antipathy in equal measure. At her co-ed primary, my daughter was surrounded by supportive boys, and she resisted my patriarchal critiques as too absolute. She forged her own connection with #MeToo in 2021, when a fellow high schooler, Chanel Contos, triggered a viral campaign against sexual abusers from Sydney’s all-male schools. #MeToo has weathered inevitable pushback since it began: for being too “politically white”; for not generating tangible change; for waging a “witch-hunt” against “gallant” men; for encouraging victims to speak out when punishment mechanisms are not in place; for making men feel confused, unsafe and fearful. But #MeToo has also unleashed an evolving, nuanced and crucial conversation, shifting the spotlight from abused to abuser. It has spread across the global south, giving agency and visibility to women in India, Bangladesh, China and South Korea. It has catalysed an overhaul of workplace practices and brought new credibility to the survivors of gendered-violence. It is providing parents of vulnerable boys, targeted by misogynists like Andrew Tate, an alternative path that shows feminism is good for men too. Male allies of #MeToo embody a new, more chivalrous masculinity that holds perpetrators of rape culture to account. In my own life, #MeToo brought me closer to my male friends, who responded to my Facebook post with concern. It gave me the confidence to document my kidnapping in a book, not as a victim, but as a survivor. It enabled me, emotionally, to finally process my assault, three decades on. And it has armed my daughter and her gen Z peers with the language they’ll need to reconfigure the nexus between feminism, gender and power in a fracturing world.

Six ‘implicitly optimistic’ novels make the International Booker prize shortlist,"Korean writer Hwang Sok-yong and German author Jenny Erpenbeck appear on this year’s International Booker shortlist, which features books exploring “divided families and divided societies”, according to prize administrator Fiammetta Rocco. Hwang is shortlisted for his ninth novel translated into English, Mater 2-10, translated by Sora Kim-Russell and Youngjae Josephine Bae. The nearly 500-page novel traces a century of Korean history through the story of three generations of a family of rail workers and a laid-off factory worker. In her Guardian review, Maya Jaggi said it provides “a worker’s-eye view of the 20th-century history surrounding Korea’s partition”. It is the third year running that a South Korean author has been shortlisted for the prize. Not a River by Selva Almada, translated by Annie McDermott (Charco) Kairos by Jenny Erpenbeck, translated by Michael Hofmann (Granta)  The Details by Ia Genberg, translated by Kira Josefsson (Wildfire)    Mater 2-10 by Hwang Sok-yong, translated by Sora Kim-Russell and Youngjae Josephine Bae (Scribe) What I’d Rather Not Think About by Jente Posthuma, translated by Sarah Timmer Harvey (Scribe)  Crooked Plow by Itamar Vieira Junior, translated by Johnny Lorenz (Verso)  While the six-strong shortlist is “implicitly optimistic”, the books engage “with current realities of racism and oppression, global violence and ecological disaster”, said judging chair and broadcaster Eleanor Wachtel. The winning author and translator, due to be announced at a London ceremony on 21 May, will each receive £25,000. Each shortlisted winner and translator will receive £2,500. Erpenbeck is shortlisted for Kairos, translated by Michael Hofmann, which tells the story of a relationship set against the collapse of the German Democratic Republic. While the novel is “bleak in its view of love and politics, spending time with Erpenbeck’s rigorous and uncompromising imagination is invigorating all the way to the final page,” wrote Natasha Walter in her Guardian review. Brazilian author Itamar Vieira Junior is shortlisted for his debut novel, Crooked Plow, translated by Johnny Lorenz. The novel looks at the lives of subsistence farmers in Brazil’s poorest region, three generations after the 1888 abolition of slavery. Its “deep dive into the quilombo communities offers a unique window into a world where the legacy of resistance and the fight for land rights weave through the personal and collective narratives of its characters, a perspective rarely captured with such intimacy and authenticity,” said the judges. Wachtel was joined on the judging panel by poet Natalie Diaz, novelist Romesh Gunesekera, visual artist William Kentridge and writer, editor and translator Aaron Robertson. The panel selected the shortlist from a longlist of 13 titles, which featured four authors from South America, signalling a “second ‘boom’ in Latin American fiction”, according to Rocco. The longlist was chosen from 149 books published in the UK and/or Ireland between 1 May 2023 and 30 April 2024. Selva Almada is the fourth author from Argentina to be shortlisted since 2020, with her novel Not a River, translated by Annie McDermott. The “deceptively simple” novel about three men going fishing on a river “slowly reveals a deep sense of foreboding and memories of trauma,” said judges. Longlisted books that did not make the shortlist include A Dictator Calls by Ismail Kadare, translated by John Hodgson; The Silver Bone by Andrey Kurkov, translated by Boris Dralyuk; and The House on Via Gemito by Domenico Starnone, translated by Oonagh Stransky. Swedish writer Ia Genberg was shortlisted for The Details, translated by Kira Josefsson, in which a woman bedridden with a high fever revisits books and memories from her past. “The nonlinear narrative renders the protagonist both vivid and obscure – the perfect conduit for this compelling, uncannily precise meditation on transience,” wrote Hephzibah Anderson in the Observer.

"Date set for Israel’s invasion of Rafah, Netanyahu says | First Thing","Good morning. Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a date had been set for an Israeli invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. He did not disclose a specific date. In preparation for the invasion, Israel is buying 40,000 tents for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the city on the border of Egypt. Israeli officials maintain that Rafah is Hamas’s last major stronghold in Gaza. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians – more than half of Gaza’s population – have taken refuge after fleeing Israeli bombardments elsewhere in the territory. What’s the situation in the rest of Gaza? The world’s global authority on food security is predicting that a famine is either already happening or will begin before July. “Everyone here has lost more than a quarter of their body weight due to malnutrition. There is no food,” said Mohammed Salha, acting director of al-Awda hospital. What about in Khan Younis? After Israel withdrew its troops from Khan Younis, thousands of Palestinians returned to the devastated city, where about 55% of buildings have been destroyed or damaged. Ahmad Abu al-Rish said: “It’s all just rubble. Animals can’t live here, so how is a human supposed to?” David Cameron, the British foreign security, has met with Donald Trump in Florida amid a push to shore up support for Ukraine and advance a new package of aid that is held up in Congress. “It is standard practice for ministers to meet with opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said. Cameron and Trump purportedly discussed Ukraine, the war in Gaza and the future of Nato during their meeting. The meeting took place before Cameron’s visit to Washington, where he is expected to push to be given the resources needed to “go on the offensive” in 2025 and will urge congressional leaders to “change the narrative” on support for Kyiv, the Foreign Office said. Joe Biden announced plans to cancel student loans for 30 million borrowers, in the administration’s latest push on addressing student debt before the presidential election. More than 100 Indigenous people in Brazil’s Javari valley – 80% of the Korobu tribe – have fallen ill, raising fears that the situation could escalate into an epidemic. The special counsel pursuing federal criminal charges against Trump for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss have filed a brief urging the supreme court to reject the former president’s bid for immunity from prosecution. Fulton county prosecutors have asked the Georgia state court of appeals to reject Trump’s request to consider his claim that the district attorney should be disqualified over a relationship with her deputy. March marked the 10th consecutive month in which yet another global heat record was shattered. Over the past 12 months, average global temperatures have been 1.58C above pre-industrial levels, exceeding the 1.5C benchmark set as a target in the Paris climate agreement. The planet has been warming at a pace of 0.3C a decade over the past 15 years, almost double the 0.18C a decade trend since the 1970s. “Is this within the range of climate variability or signal of accelerated warming? My concern is it might be too late if we just wait to see,” said Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, one of the vice-chairs of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Green onions, a simple staple of Korean cooking, have become a powerful symbol of voter anger in the weeks leading up to South Korea’s national assembly elections. After a botched visit to a supermarket by Yoon Suk Yeol, the country’s conservative president, in an effort to seem relatable amid a cost of living crisis, the National Election Commission has banned green onions outside polling stations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”. In Ethiopia, where coffee comprises about a third of its export earnings, new European legislation could have significant impact on the industry. The EU regulation on deforestation-free products (EUDR) – due to come into force in 2025 – bans the sale of coffee, rubber, cocoa and other products if companies cannot prove that it did not come from deforested land. Ethiopia’s coffee industry is claiming that the new rules are unfair since almost all Ethiopia’s coffee is grown by poor farmers who own small plots of land and lack the expertise to gather the complex data needed to show compliance. “Meeting the criteria requires a lot of technology and manpower that we simply don’t have,” said Abebe Megnecto, the manager of Kafa’s coffee union, which represents 13,676 local farmers. Despite their commitments on the climate, the world’s biggest economies have continued to finance the expansion of fossil fuels in poor countries. The G20 group of developed and developing economies, and the multilateral development banks they fund, put $142bn into fossil fuel developments overseas from 2020 to 2022. “While rich countries continue to drag their feet and claim they can’t afford to fund a globally just energy transition, countries like Canada, Korea, Japan and the US appear to have no shortage of public funds for climate-wrecking fossil fuels,” said Claire O’Manique, a public finance analyst at campaigning group Oil Change International. A West Virginia woman has set a world record by marrying a man who is nearly three feet shorter than her. Jessica Burns-McDonnell is 5ft 10in (1.8 metres) while her husband, Larry – who was born with diastrophic dwarfism – is 3ft (91.4cm). “I mean, you might find a person who looks exactly like what you want but you need someone who makes you feel and think and love,” Burns-McDonnell said. “That’s what I got with Larry, and I don’t think there’s anybody out there that’s taller than Larry that could come close.” First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

David Cameron meets Donald Trump amid push to shore up Ukraine support,"The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has taken the unusual and potentially risky step of travelling to see Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida before a visit to Washington DC on Tuesday. Cameron was hoping to persuade the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to drop his opposition to a new package of aid for Ukraine that is being held up in Congress partly on Trump’s instruction. It is Cameron’s second visit to the US to try to convince Republicans that it is in America’s national interest for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, not to make any further military advances in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Sunday that Ukraine would lose the war if US aid was withheld and Ukrainian air cover not improved. The risk is that past bad blood between Cameron and Trump over issues such as Brexit have poisoned the well, and Cameron, for all his persuasive skills, is not the British political leader most likely to make Trump change his mind. Cameron is scheduled to hold talks with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington on Tuesday. Although they have much to discuss covering the future of Nato, China and a possible ceasefire in Gaza, the foreign secretary’s key goal is to shift Republican thinking in Congress on the relevance of the threat posed by Russia to American interests. A steady stream of European politicians have travelled to Washington on similar missions, only to return frustrated at the growing US indifference to Ukraine’s fate. The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has so far declined to allow the Ukraine aid issue onto the floor of the Congress, but has indicated he might do so next week when Congress returns from recess. In February, the speaker refused to consider a Senate-passed foreign aid package that would have included $60bn for Ukraine because it lacked measures relating to security on the US-Mexico border. In a statement on Monday, a Foreign Office spokesperson played down the rarity of a Conservative foreign secretary trying to persuade a Republican not to make concessions to Russia over the future of Europe. The Foreign Office said it was “standard practice for ministers to meet opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement”. Although Conservative politicians have met Trump, as has his great ally Nigel Farage, Monday’s meeting was the first between a senior UK minister and Trump since he left office insisting that the presidential election had been stolen from him. Trump has said he can negotiate a peace deal on Ukraine in 24 hours. His allies say the deal will involve ceding Crimea and the Donbas region to Russia, formalising the land grab that Putin started in 2014 and continued with the full-scale invasion in 2022. “Success for Ukraine and failure for [Vladimir] Putin are vital for American and European security,” Cameron said before his trip. “This will show that borders matter, that aggression doesn’t pay and that countries like Ukraine are free to choose their own future. The alternative would only encourage Putin in further attempts to redraw European borders by force, and would be heard clearly in Beijing, Tehran and North Korea.” Earlier this year, he warned Congress not to show “the weakness displayed against Hitler” in the 1930s. Cameron is also arguing that Ukraine has shown time and again that if it is given the resources it can succeed and would be ready to “go on the offensive” in 2025. Aware that Trump believes Europe does not pull its weight in defending itself, Cameron is armed with statistics to show more than $184bn (£145bn) has already been committed to Ukraine by European nations including more than $15bn (nearly £12bn) from the UK. Cameron will say in DC that nothing can match the pace and scale of US support, which remains “the keystone in the arch” in the fight for democracy, the Foreign Office said. The US sent its final tranche of munitions and equipment in December, using the last of its funding from a previous supplemental to assist Ukrainian forces. On a previous trip to the US, the rightwing congresswoman and staunch Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene told Cameron to “kiss my ass” and “worry about his own country”. A key test for Cameron’s trip is whether he gains meetings with the swing Republican congressmen including Johnson. At present no meeting with Johnson is slated for Tuesday. Talks will also focus on the Middle East, with the foreign secretary expected to set out the UK’s reasoning for not suspending arms sales to Israel. Ministers face Labour pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. Downing Street said it had no plans to publish the advice but that it wanted to be transparent about its decision to continue exporting arms during the Gaza conflict. Cameron will also be pressed on whether the UK supports an Israeli offensive in Rafah, the southern hold-out town in Gaza, if the current round of talks between Hamas and Israel being staged in Cairo fail.

"Michael Palin on the loss of his wife of 57 years: ‘I’d love Helen to still be here, telling me off’","The strange thing about Michael Palin is you feel you know him; that he’s an old friend or much-loved uncle you’ve not seen for a while. He decides to come to Guardian HQ for our interview, and nobody seems surprised to see him, despite the fact that it’s his first time in the building. People smile at Palin with easy familiarity: ah, Michael’s popped in. He smiles back with that fabulously genial smile: a little bit cheeky, a little bit shy, and very warm. We have never met before. But he’s been in my life for 50-odd years. First as part of Monty Python, the surrealist comedy troupe I quoted ad nauseam as a youngster (“Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition!”), then as star of the wonderful TV series Ripping Yarns, which I also quoted ad nauseam (“Oh shut up, you boring little tit!”). There were also the films: Time Bandits, A Private Function, A Fish Called Wanda and, more recently, The Death of Stalin. For the past 35 years, he has travelled the globe for TV shows, and written books to accompany his odysseys. In 2019, he was knighted for services to travel, culture and geography – the only Python to receive a knighthood. Now he has got a new three-part TV series about Nigeria, where he meets young people hoping to make their fortune: a young woman trying to rebuild her life after being kidnapped by Boko Haram; an environmentalist fighting government corruption; and a woman who berates him for the sins of British colonialism in Benin. It is fascinating to observe the dynamics between the diffident, eternally apologetic Palin and the more direct Nigerians. He is visibly shocked when the woman shouts him down in the street and makes him take the rap for Britain’s brutal Benin Expedition of 1897. The series is important for him as an exploration of Nigeria, as well as a means of confronting Britain’s past. But it is also important in a more personal way. This is the first major project he has taken on since his wife Helen died 10 months ago. They had been married for 57 years, having first met in 1959, on a family trip to Southwold in Suffolk, when he was 15 and she was 16. Their holiday romance was fictionalised in his 1987 BBC drama East of Ipswich. Although Helen rarely accompanied him on his travels, he worried he wouldn’t be able to do the Nigeria trip without her. “I was quite concerned about whether I could physically and mentally deal with it just a few months after Helen had died. But I enjoyed the experience tremendously. I felt I can do this, I can get out there. It’s not someone giving me a job because my wife’s just died. Actually, it regenerated me in a way.” Helen, a teacher and then a bereavement counsellor, was 80 when she died of kidney failure, after stopping her dialysis treatment because she was in so much pain. It was Helen, he says, who encouraged him to do the travel documentaries in the first place. Palin was 45 when he was offered Around the World in 80 Days, a seven-part BBC series inspired by the Jules Verne novel. “Helen was quite clear that if I didn’t do this I’d be sort of moodily staring across the kitchen table at someone else doing it. She knew I’d be happier if I did the travels and avoided staying at home.” His expeditions included the 23,000-mile trip from the north to south pole, North Korea, and Ethiopia mid-coup. Did Helen worry for him? He laughs. If she did, she didn’t show it. “She was quite calm about wherever I was.” Palin is a master of understatement, opinions usually qualified by “quite”. He could be away for five months at a time. Sometimes he would find it hard, he says, but he’s convinced his travels helped their marriage. How? “Well, they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it’s true. Our relationship was very loving, but it was very practical. Very pragmatic.” Although they valued their independence, they shared so much: values, confidences, sense of humour, friends. During Helen’s final two years she suffered huge discomfort. “She told me how ill she felt, how unhappy she felt at not being able to live the life she wanted. Most of my time was spent just trying to assuage her pain. She was amazing how she dealt with it.” Helen died at the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead, north London, last May. Palin says the final couple of weeks, with their three children there, too, could not have been happier. “Just before she died, when she knew she was going to die, were actually some of the best times we’ve had. I was prepared for it. Helen had taken the decision that she wasn’t going to carry on having dialysis. She was amazingly well looked after, and all the family were there. And that was the payoff for all those years, those 60 years.” He talks so tenderly about Helen and the end of her life. Then he comes to an abrupt stop, as if clicked out of hypnosis. “Sorry, I’m waffling,” he says. No you’re not, I say. I ask what he means by the payoff. “Well, because we’d spent so long together, we knew each other pretty well.” He pauses. Even he knows this is an understatement too far. “Very, very well. It didn’t all have to be stated why we’d like this or that. We didn’t have to say a lot. It was just there. So knowing that she had two weeks to live, somehow everything that had been part of our relationship made it much easier to deal with her departure.” There were no scores to settle, confessions to make, or misunderstandings to iron out. They knew everything about each other. So there wasn’t even much need for talking. “The most important thing to me in her last days was making sure she had access to the family and friends I knew she loved and would not see again. I was just sort of shepherding her through and making sure she was able to talk to the people she wanted to talk to; or, if she just wanted peace and quiet, she’d have peace and quiet.” Does it still seem very recent? “Yes. I mean, I’m quite surprised. I’ve been working quite hard since she died, and that’s been a distraction. But every now and then, the house seems empty and you feel you’ll never have a friend as close as that; you’ll never have someone who knows as much about you as Helen did about me. There are things I can’t talk about in the same way to anybody else. I’ve got lots of good friends, and we can chat about things, but, you know, the rapport between the two of us over all these years was quite singular. And I miss that. I sometimes think: she lived to be 80, I’m 80 now, so what’s next? What do you do with the rest of the time? Partly, I think, well, at 80 you’re on your way to the departure lounge.” He doesn’t say this in a maudlin way. It feels more as if he’s thinking aloud. You are an incredibly youthful 80, I say. Would you like to find somebody you could share things with in the same way? “Oh, I just can’t imagine anybody else taking Helen’s place.” Anyway, he says, in some sense she’s still with him. “I always listen to Helen. I mean, I’m kind of in touch with her on a daily basis because I know what she would think about all the various things that I do.” Do you talk to her? “Well, yeah, I do occasionally.” When? “Well, I just do it coming into an empty room after you’ve had a long session or something, doing a long interview for the Guardian, whatever, something that really kind of wears you out! You get in and you’re going through the door, and I always speak and say: ‘Whoa, wow, that was something!’ It’s just as a little moment, which helps me when I get into the house, rather than just going in and it’s all key in the lock and silence.” Look, he says, he’s not complaining. He knows he’s been lucky to experience such love. Come to think of it, he says, he’s been lucky in life. Palin grew up in Sheffield. Like his father (an engineer who worked for a steel company) and his grandfather, he went to the private school Shrewsbury and was Oxbridge educated. His father, Edward, had a good sense of humour, but his jokes were impeded by a terrible stammer. “He was quite an angry man, and he had quite a short fuse. It was difficult in the house to talk about things, generally. And he was picking arguments all the time with my mother. I think he rather took it out on people around him. He was very confrontational, which has made me unconfrontational. I try anything to avoid confrontation.” Typically of Palin, rather than rejecting his father, he sought to understand his frustration and gave his name to the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering. He never dared to dream of making a career out of comedy, acting, travelling or writing. (The project he says he’s proudest of is his 2018 book, Erebus: The Story of a Ship, about the eponymous vessel that ventured farther south than any human had ever been on its first voyage, and vanished with its 129-strong crew in the wastes of the Canadian Arctic on its second.) Palin assumed he was destined for a regular, respectable job. But, he says, he has always been in the right place at the right time. At Oxford, he met the cultural historian Robert Hewison, who suggested his humour was a gift and potentially a lucrative one. He was introduced to future fellow Pythons, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman, who had all studied at Cambridge, and they decided to work as a team. Perhaps luckiest of all was the day they visited the BBC in 1969 on the off-chance of getting some work. “It was remarkable. We were chaperoned by Barry Took who was very keen on the work we’d done individually. He said: ‘Well, I’ve got a suit on and I can take you to the BBC and find you someone we can talk to. We were ushered into a small room and Michael Mills, who was head of comedy, came in after quite a good lunch I think, because he was in quite a good mood, and he asked us various questions about what we wanted to do. None of which we were able to adequately respond to. It was the world’s worst job interview. Was there going to be music? We don’t know. Were there going to be guest artists? Well, we don’t know. Were there going to be women in the show? We don’t know. At the end, Mills stood up and looked down the table at us and said: ‘I’ll give you 13 shows but that’s all.’ It was the best sentence anybody’s ever said to me in my life.” Does he think that could happen at the BBC today? “No. The BBC was much more buccaneering back then. There were individuals who could make decisions on their own if they wanted to take a chance with something others didn’t like. And, to be honest, most people in the BBC hierarchy didn’t like Monty Python to start with at all. But you could do it and it would be respected. Now there would be far more investigations into what you wanted to do, people checking content and that you’re not being rude about people. I don’t think it would have gone anywhere today. It would have been censored at source.” Palin shares some of the concerns Cleese has expressed about topics increasingly being considered off limits in comedy. “At the moment it’s getting a bit ridiculous, when there are strictures over what you can say. I don’t think the outside world should impose on comedy. Comedy should subvert. Comedy’s got to make you feel freer.” Why does he think Python proved so influential? “People found it quite bracing. You were able to make jokes about the prime minister and the army and the church, which you’d never been able to do before. It’s very important that people can escape, in comedy, from the conformity they’re forced into.” He says it is dangerous to be rose-tinted about the past, but he does worry that the country has become more intolerant and less caring. “Political discourse has become very unpleasant. The country is run on the basis of getting as much money out of people as we can everywhere. It’s all about marketing and selling.” Does he think he has changed over the years? “Not really. I’m a cautious and slightly shy person and always have been. But I’ve been given a chance to do things I never expected. All that is quite surprising to me.” There have been profoundly bleak moments in his life. He lost too many friends early, including former Pythons Terry Jones (his main collaborator) and Chapman, as well as ex-Beatle George Harrison. His sister Angela killed herself when she was 52, something he has never come to terms with. “She was absolutely terrific. But she had this long-term depression. I could never quite understand where it came from, how deep it was, but it was there. That was a loss I’ve never really quite understood. I can’t understand why somebody, who had such talent and ability and was so liked, should have … why there should have been such a dark space there …” He trails off. Fortunately, he says, his disposition is sunny, and the stability in his life has kept him grounded. Again, he returns to Helen. “My horizons are fairly local. Helen and I were together for 60 years, we lived in the same part of London a long time; I have never wanted to change the basics of my life: the relationships, the friends, the house. It’s been essential for them to be there so I could not get totally deluded by fame and success.” Palin is all talked out. He tells me, apologetically, that he is exhausted, and again mentions his age. “I’m 80-plus now,” he says. What’s with the plus? “OK, 80 and 11 months!” He grins. “It’s time to go walking off the end of a pier.” I tell him I don’t think he’s ready for the departure lounge, or the end of the pier. He nods, and says I’ve got a point. In 2019, he had open-heart surgery: one valve replaced, one repaired. “Now that’s sorted, and I’m more cautious about what I eat and drink, I feel fitter than I have done in ages.” All things considered, he says, he’s pretty content. “You’ve got to keep doing things. I’d love Helen to still be with me, telling me off, but yes, I’m very happy where I am.” Michael Palin in Nigeria starts on 16 April at 9pm on Channel 5.

The world court will rule on Germany’s support for Israel. That shows how geopolitics has changed | Steve Crawshaw,"The case brought by Nicaragua against Germany at the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague this week is a powerful example of the unprecedented political impact that the Gaza conflict is having around the world. Most obviously, Israel’s continuing assault after the 1,200 brutal murders and about 240 kidnappings by Hamas on 7 October has had a deadly impact on Palestinians. More than 30,000 people in Gaza have been killed, and a famine is now looming. The conflict has also opened up a division between the global north and south in a way not seen before. Nicaragua’s case focuses on Germany’s supply of arms to Israel – the country supplied more than €326m (£258m) last year, which equated to more than a quarter of Israel’s military imports. It also calls on Germany to restore Gaza funding to Unrwa, the UN agency that provides Palestinians with humanitarian aid. Nicaragua says the arms sales mean Germany is “facilitating” genocide. On Monday, it accused Germany of doing “business as usual – or better than usual” because of its burgeoning weapons sales. Germany, which is due to respond today, says Israel has breached “neither the genocide convention nor international humanitarian law” and that it remains “calm”. In some respects, its calmness is justified: Nicaragua’s accusation of complicity in genocide sets a high burden of proof. But Germany is under pressure, too. After 7 October, chancellor Olaf Scholz said that “there is only one place for Germany: at Israel’s side”. It was, he said, “a perpetual task for us to stand up for the security of the state of Israel”. The good intentions that underlie that philosophy – Israel as Germany’s “raison d’état”, in the words of Scholz’s predecessor Angela Merkel – are clear. But Germany’s unquestioning support for Israel is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. Germany sees itself as a global voice for human rights, yet it has continued to sell arms to Israel, and has silenced the voices of Jewish people and members of the public who have condemned the Israeli assault. Nicaragua’s court challenge puts this into sharp perspective. South Africa’s case at the ICJ in January challenged one taboo by accusing Israel itself of inciting or committing genocide – a word created by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer, in 1944 in direct response to the Holocaust. This week, Nicaragua is challenging another taboo by suggesting that Germany, whose very identity is built around taking responsibility for that earlier genocide, is now paving the way for that same crime. As Der Spiegel puts it: “Germany’s international reputation, after all, is partially based on the fact that it has drawn credible lessons from its criminal past … But since 7 October, accusations have been swirling that Berlin is applying a double standard.” German opinion polls have swung dramatically in ways that no politician can ignore. Critics of the Gaza assault have more than doubled to 69%; support for Israel’s conduct of the war has collapsed to just 18%. Almost nine in 10 Germans now think there should be more pressure on Israel. Germany’s Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, sounded impatient when she said that aid must immediately get into Gaza with “no more excuses”. The Social Democrat Scholz has begun to sound critical, too, asking on a visit to Israel last month: “No matter how important the goal, can it justify such terribly high costs? Or are there other ways to achieve your goal?” German lawyers have brought a case calling for Germany to end its arms sales to Israel. Britain and other governments are facing the same pressures, while a Dutch court found a “clear risk” that exported F-35 jet parts could be used in breaches of international humanitarian law. Nicaragua is hardly a poster child when it comes to respect for human rights. Its 78-year-old president, Daniel Ortega, seen as a liberal darling when rebels defeated a dictatorship 45 years ago, presides over what a recent UN report described as “serious systematic human rights violations, tantamount to crimes against humanity”, including “a spiral of violence marked by the persecution of all forms of political opposition”. Nicaragua was one of just four governments – along with Syria, North Korea and Belarus – that backed Russia’s illegal annexation of eastern Ukraine in 2022. But Nicaragua’s hypocrisy on human rights doesn’t take away from the double standards that Germany and others have displayed. The UN security council remains a lost cause for enforcing human rights because of America’s continuing veto mindset (a matching pair to Moscow’s veto on Syria). The ICJ is therefore becoming a place where pressure can be exerted. Some of that pressure is on Israel itself. But especially susceptible are those governments that are caught between a rock and a judicially hard place – reluctant to argue with Israel, but equally eager not to pick fights with the world court, whose other current cases include Ukraine and potential genocide in Myanmar. This week’s Nicaragua case is one of three Israel cases all running in parallel in The Hague (four, if you count the international criminal court, which recently appointed a former British military prosecutor to lead its Gaza investigations). In February, the ICJ held hearings on the request from the UN general assembly to examine the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies in the occupied territories. Last month, the court followed up on its January finding of a “plausible” risk of genocide, in response to the case brought by South Africa. (South Africa, too, is selective about whose human rights it cares about; Pretoria has rolled out the red carpet for a Sudanese warlord accused of grave war crimes.) In their most recent rulings, judges unanimously demanded the “unhindered provision at scale” of humanitarian aid in Gaza, and also demanded, by a majority of fifteen to one, that Israel ensure “with immediate effect” that its military does not commit acts of genocide. Cumulatively, these court cases, thousands of miles from New York, are a reminder that the rules of geopolitics have changed. Once upon a time, western governments could always be confident of protecting their friends, no matter what crimes they were alleged to have committed. As this week’s hearings remind us, those days are gone.

Australia says military collaboration with Japan is not about creating ‘Jaukus’,"Aukus partners are set to collaborate with Japan on military technology but they are not creating “Jaukus”, Australian leaders say. In a joint statement released on Tuesday, the Aukus triumvirate of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States confirmed it was considering teaming up with Japan for the second stage of the Aukus strategy. The Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, the UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, and the US defence secretary, Lloyd J Austin, said they were seeking advanced military capability “in support of regional stability and security”. The idea has drawn the ire of China, which said it was “gravely concerned” about a plan that was “stoking bloc confrontation”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia insists its plan to buy up to three Virginia-class submarines from the US while the local industry gets up to speed does not mean it is obliged to help the US in any military efforts in the region. However, the US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, last week suggested they could be deployed against China in any military conflict over Taiwan. China has always been a vocal critic of Aukus and its implied mission to push back against Chinese power. While Aukus talk often focuses on Australia’s planned procurement of nuclear-powered submarines, the boats are “pillar 1”. Pillar 2 will include underwater drones, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, electronic warfare and hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Tuesday that Japan was a “natural candidate” for collaboration. “We’ve already stepped up our defence relationship with Japan in agreements I’ve signed with prime minister [Fumio] Kishida, including access by Japan for Australian bases,” he said. “We have had recently joint naval operations with Japan, including here in Australia, but, when we look at pillar 2, that project-by-project approach is there. What is not proposed is to expand the membership of Aukus.” Marles said Japan had a “very advanced technological industrial base” and did “a lot of incredible work in defence industry as well” but would not be part of the three-nation team. The Australian defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said any projects would be “about technological collaboration where it makes sense for all parties involved”. “It’s not about Japan joining Aukus. It’s not about Japan being part of the Five Eyes intelligence community,” he told ABC’s Radio National. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said the US, UK and Australia were “sending signals of Aukus expansion” and “escalating [an] arms race in the Asia-Pacific to the detriment of peace and stability in the region”. “China is gravely concerned about it,” Ning said. “We oppose relevant countries cobbling together exclusive groupings and stoking bloc confrontation. “Japan needs to earnestly draw lessons from history and stay prudent on military and security issues.” Japan became a pacifist nation after the second world war, when the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and enforced a constitution that the nation never maintain military forces. About a decade later, it created the Self-Defense Forces. More recently, in reaction to China’s belligerence and North Korea’s aggressive tactics, it has been increasing its defence spending and capability. The Aukus defence ministers said the “acquisition of a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability is a necessary response to the rapidly evolving strategic environment”. “Strengthening our trilateral defence capabilities and our industrial capacity will enable Aukus partners to deter coercion or aggression in the region more effectively,” the statement said. It went on to say that the Aukus nations had been clear they planned to “engage others” in pillar 2 projects, and were “considering cooperation with Japan”. “Our objective remains to further the delivery of advanced military capabilities to our respective defence forces in support of regional stability and security; we are confident that engaging like-minded partners in the work of pillar 2 will only strengthen this pursuit,” the statement said. “Recognising Japan’s strengths and its close bilateral defence partnerships with all three countries, we are considering cooperation with Japan on Aukus Pillar II advanced capability projects.” The US president, Joe Biden, is set to meet with Kishida this week, and the pair will reportedly discuss the collaboration. Since Aukus was announced in 2021, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea have also been mentioned as potential partners.",2024-04-09T06:27:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/australia-says-military-collaboration-with-japan-is-not-about-creating-jaukus,The Guardian
Tuesday briefing: What to expect from the next phase of the Post Office inquiry,"Good morning. It is, in the words of the prime minister, “one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history”. The Post Office Horizon scandal led to 236 innocent subpostmasters being sent to prison, and more than 4,000 others suffering – whether it be losing jobs, bankruptcy, family breakdowns or homelessness. At least four of those accused have since killed themselves. Starting today – 25 years after the first post office operators were convicted for theft, fraud and false accounting that we now know was caused not by them but by the Post Office’s faulty IT system – the former subpostmasters’ stories will be heard at the public inquiry into the scandal. At 10am today Alan Bates – the real life hero of the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, in which he is played by Toby Jones – will take the stand at Aldwych House, in central London, and tell the inquiry his story. Then, in the coming weeks and month’s the Post Office’s bosses, including former chief executive Paula Vennells, will be called to give evidence under oath about what they really knew about the faulty Horizon IT system – and, crucially, when. For today’s newsletter, my colleague Jane Croft, who has been covering the scandal since 2018, provides a primer of what to expect. That’s after the headlines, but spoiler alert: expect the sudden onset of “amnesia” to continue, with many ex-bosses saying: “I do not recall.” Israel-Gaza | David Cameron will set out the UK’s reasoning for continuing to export arms to Israel on Tuesday as ministers face ongoing pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. On Monday evening, the foreign secretary held talks with Donald Trump in Florida amid a push to shore up support for Ukraine. Carers | Ministers are facing calls to abandon the “cruel and nonsensical” fines levied on tens of thousands of unpaid carers for unwittingly breaching earnings rules by just a few pounds a week. The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a centre-right thinktank, said the government should accept that it was to blame for allowing overpayments to run up to huge sums. Fossil fuels | The world’s biggest economies have continued to finance the expansion of fossil fuels in poor countries to the tune of billions of dollars, despite their commitments on the climate. Canada, Japan and South Korea were the biggest sources of such finance in the three years studied, according to campaigning groups Oil Change International (OCI) and Friends of the Earth US. Home Office | Families in Gaza have won a legal case against the Home Office after a judge found it had reached “irrational and unreasonable” conclusions to justify its refusal to consider the families’ reunion applications. Two challenges were brought against the government department after it refused to decide on reunion applications from families in Gaza without biometric data. Politics | Downing Street has urged MPs to be cautious when responding to unsolicited messages, after the “spear-phishing” attack that targeted more than a dozen MPs, staff and journalists working in Westminster. On Tuesday evening it was reported that William Wragg, the Conservative MP who divulged colleagues’ personal phone numbers as part of the scandal, had stepped down from two Commons roles. It’s a scandal that has been ruining lives across the country for decades, but it only really hit the wider public consciousness when the ITV drama came out over the Christmas holidays. “Suddenly, the Post Office scandal was leading the news bulletins,” Jane says. “And politicians were falling over themselves to talk about how awful it was.” Less than a week after the final episode of the drama, Rishi Sunak announced legislation for a new law to “swiftly exonerate and compensate” all the victims. “People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and their reputations destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own. The victims must get justice and compensation,” he said on 10 January. The inquiry, chaired by retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, has been trying to get to the truth since it launched on 29 September 2020. It is phases five and six, covering “redress”, “oversight” and “whistleblowing”, that begin today. What has the inquiry heard so far? “The impact this scandal has had on thousands of people’s lives has been truly devastating,” Jane says. “These are ordinary people, without money and connections that have been caught up in this real David and Goliath battle.” In personal impact statements to the inquiry, the victims have spoken about losing everything. “It’s not just their money,” Jane says. “It’s their liberty, their partners, their families, their homes. Some spoke about their children being bullied at school, being shunned by their local community, and being referred to as ‘the postmaster who stole old people’s pensions’.” Jo Hamilton, who ran a post office in a village shop in South Warnborough, Hampshire and was played by Monica Dolan in the TV series, pleaded guilty to false accounting. She had to pay back a supposedly missing £36,000, though the grandmother-of-three did avoid jail. But the trauma continued. One day, while making Easter bonnets at her granddaughter’s school, the headteacher told her she would have to leave the premises as she could not be alone with the children because of her conviction. “Jo, and the other subpostmasters, have had or will get compensation,” Jane says. “But their lives have been absolutely ruined. You can’t compensate for lost time, you can’t buy back time.” What do the post office operators want the inquiry to find out now? “They want justice and for the truth to come out,” Jane says. “It feels like the Post Office knew the Horizon IT system wasn’t working properly, but they continued to prosecute these innocent people anyway.” The subpostmasters want to know what Post Office bosses, executives from Fujitsu (the Japanese company that developed the IT software), and government ministers knew about the faulty Horizon system. The judge in a high court case in 2019 concluded that “bugs, errors and defects” meant there was a “material risk” Horizon was to blame for the money missing from post office operators’ accounts.Paula Vennells – who was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019, for which she earned about £5m – is likely to be asked why she decided to spend millions prosecuting the post office operators when the company was aware of the Horizon problems. Who knew what about Horizon – and when? Whether the Horizon system could be used to remotely access post office operators’ accounts is key to the scandal, and alleged cover-up. In 2015 the Post Office told a House of Commons inquiry: “There is no functionality in Horizon for either a branch, Post Office or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or remove transaction data once it has been recorded in a branch’s accounts.” This was untrue, a high court judge ruled in a landmark court case four years later. In fact, staff at Fujitsu were capable of remotely accessing branch accounts, and had “unrestricted and unaudited” access to those systems, the inquiry heard. A recording from 2013, unearthed by Channel 4 News, shows Susan Crichton, the Post Office’s head lawyer, confirm that Vennells had been briefed about a “covert operations team” that could remotely access the Horizon system and adjust branches’ accounts. The recordings suggest Vennells was aware of claims that remote access to branch accounts was possible two years before prosecutions were halted against post office operators. In 2015 Vennells told the Commons business select committee that “we have no evidence” of miscarriages of justice. Vennells, an ordained Anglican priest, refused to comment when Channel 4 News tracked her down at her parish church over the weekend. In a statement released by her lawyers, she said: “I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system. “I now intend to continue to focus on assisting the inquiry and will not make any further public comment until it has concluded.” Vennells, who has handed back a CBE awarded to her for “services to the Post Office and to charity”, will give evidence, live-streamed here, for three days from Wednesday 22 May. Is the public inquiry enough, or should the police be called in? Nadhim Zahawi, the former chancellor who was one of the MPs questioning Vennells in 2015, has called for a “thorough police investigation”. “I don’t think it’s good enough that we keep falling back on ‘let the inquiry do its work’ – this is much more serious,” he said. “There needs to be an investigation into corporate manslaughter and individuals at the Post Office.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Kevin Hollinrake, the Post Office minister, on Monday told a group of 50 post office operators who reconvened at the village hall in Fenny Compton (where they founded the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance campaign group in 2009) that those responsible “should go to jail”. “People should be prosecuted,” he said. “That’s my view. And I think you and other people I’ve spoken to certainly feel that people within the Post Office and possibly further afield should go to jail.” How much coffee is too much?

From the frying pan to the fire: green onions ignite voter anger in South Korea’s elections,"Yoon Suk Yeol is hardly the first elected politician to appear out of touch with ordinary voters during a cost-of-living crisis. But as South Korea prepares for key national assembly elections on Wednesday, its conservative president has been tripped up by a humble vegetable. In recent weeks, green onions have gone from a simple staple of Korean cooking to a powerful symbol of voter anger over rising prices in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy. Its ascent from the kitchen into politics came during Yoon’s recent visit to a supermarket in Seoul that was intended to portray him as someone who understands the financial pressures faced by ordinary families. Yoon said he had been to many markets and described as “reasonable” the store’s 875 won (51p) price tag for a bundle of green onions. Observers were quick to point out, however, that the items had been only temporarily discounted thanks to government subsidies, while the supermarket had made a further price cut. The actual retail price is three to four times higher, hovering at 3,000-4,000 won in recent weeks. Yoon’s People Power party is hoping to take control of the 300-seat assembly from a liberal majority led by the opposition Democratic party but the trip to the shops has added to criticism that Yoon appears aloof. It has fuelled a surge in support for smaller parties that could upset the balance of power and render Yoon a lame-duck leader just two years into his presidency. His party has already been grappling with low approval ratings before the vote, which is being seen as a midterm referendum on Yoon’s administration. It is not just the price of green onions that has seen significant rises. The price of agricultural products in March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The price of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980. Nevertheless, opposition candidates have used green onions as props during campaign speeches to draw attention to Yoon’s hapless attempt to court the average man and woman on the Seoul omnibus. Social media was awash with onion memes, with some users posting photographs of green onions outside polling stations after the National Election Commission banned green onions from the locations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”. “While people’s expression of political views should be respected to the maximum level, using a certain item as a means of expression other than for their original purpose has great potential to affect the election,” the commission said. Hyun Jung, 36, said she hadn’t initially thought about the green onion issue, “but after I heard about the ban, I bought a green onion hairband and I’m determined to wear it on election day”. If Yoon’s party fails to win more seats and take control of the assembly, Yoon risks seeing out the remaining three years of his term struggling to pass his policy agenda. “If the People Power party is still a minority party after the general election … cooperation with the National Assembly will be very difficult,” Kang Joo-hyun, a professor of political science and international relations at Sookmyung Women’s University, told Agence France-Presse. “The president will become a lame duck quickly and … the power of state affairs will be greatly reduced.” In a Gallup survey on 31 March, the opposition Democratic party, led by Lee Jae-myung, was polling slightly ahead of Yoon’s party – 37% to 35%. The opposition parties are framing the votes as “judgment day”, suggesting that it is not just about choosing political candidates but also an opportunity for the public to send a strong message to the government over its handling of the economy. Yoon, whose scandal-hit wife has been conspicuously absent from the campaign, is battling low approval ratings. His popularity did, though, gain momentum after he announced an increase in medical school trainees. The move was criticised by thousands of trainee doctors who have been on strike since February but voters who are worried about the country’s ability to care for its fast-ageing population have supported the move. Disaffection with the political establishment has given smaller parties a rare opportunity to gain ground, including the Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk. On the eve of the election Cho, whose party is competing only for the 46 seats contested through proportional representation, was polling neck-and-neck with the ruling party, despite being launched only four weeks ago, and is forecast to win between 10 and 15 seats. Securing about 15 seats would enable Cho’s party to potentially form a coalition that could prevent the People Power party from regaining control of the assembly. “If the opposition parties gain a significant number of seats … Yoon regime’s system will be shaken, and cracks will appear,” said Cho. “The People Power party will be divided. The president will become a lame duck, and then a dead duck,” said Cho, who was forced to abandon his presidential ambitions by a 2019 university admissions scandal. Suh Pureunhaneul, a restaurant employee in Seoul, summed up popular disaffection with the established parties, especially over the prohibitive cost of housing in the capital. “It feels like they’re just promoting measures to maintain land prices rather than addressing what I really need,” he said. “Looking at the election, it feels like there’s no one I want to vote for. I wonder if voting would even make a difference.”",2024-04-09T04:55:28Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/south-korea-national-assembly-elections-2024-green-onions-supermarket-crisis-cost-of-living,The Guardian
World’s biggest economies pumping billions into fossil fuels in poor nations,"The world’s biggest economies have continued to finance the expansion of fossil fuels in poor countries to the tune of billions of dollars, despite their commitments on the climate. The G20 group of developed and developing economies, and the multilateral development banks they fund, put $142bn (£112bn) into fossil fuel developments overseas from 2020 to 2022, according to estimates compiled by the campaigning groups Oil Change International (OCI) and Friends of the Earth US. Canada, Japan and South Korea were the biggest sources of such finance in the three years studied, and gas received more funding than either coal or oil. The G7 group of biggest economies, to which Japan and Canada belong, pledged in 2022 to halt overseas funding of fossil fuels. But while funding for coal has rapidly diminished, finance for oil and gas projects has continued at a strong pace. Some of the money is going to other developed economies, including Australia, but much of it is to the developing world. However, richer middle income countries still receive more finance than the poorest. The most recent G7 pledge, in the study, is to phase out all overseas fossil fuel funding by the end of 2022. The OCI study concentrates on the period from the beginning of the fiscal year of 2020-21 for each country, to the end of the fiscal year of 2022-23. However, the researchers also found that Japan had continued to make new fossil fuel investments overseas in the past few weeks, up to mid-March 2024, exploiting loopholes in its promise to end fossil fuel funding. The World Bank provided about $1.2bn a year to fossil fuels over the three-year period, of which about two-thirds went to gas projects. The US, Germany and Italy also provided billions in funding a year to overseas fossil fuel projects before the end of 2022-23, according to the report published on Tuesday. The UK supplied about $600m a year on average. Canada supplied just under $11bn a year on average, in the 2020-22 period studied, while South Korea put forward $10bn and Japan about $7bn. Over the same three-year period, the G20 economies put about $104bn into clean energy developments overseas, according to the report. Claire O’Manique, a public finance analyst at OCI, said: “While rich countries continue to drag their feet and claim they can’t afford to fund a globally just energy transition, countries like Canada, Korea, Japan and the US appear to have no shortage of public funds for climate-wrecking fossil fuels. “We must continue to hold wealthy countries accountable for their role in funding the climate crisis, and demand they move first and fastest on a fossil fuel phase-out, to stop funding fossil fuels, and that they pay their fair share of a globally just transition, loss and damage and adaptation finance.” Makiko Arima, a senior finance campaigner at OCI, called on Japan particularly to stop supporting fossil fuels. Japan has lobbied behind the scenes to stop G7 countries adopting a stronger stance on fossil fuels, and in favour of some key projects. Arima said: “Japan is derailing the transition to renewable energy across Asia and globally. Despite its G7 commitment to end fossil fuel financing, its public financial institutions like the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) continue to support new fossil fuel projects, including the Scarborough gasfield in Australia and gas power plants in Mexico. “JBIC is currently investigating a claim that it failed to follow its social and environmental safeguards in developing the Philippines’ first LNG [liquefied natural gas] terminal in Batangas. Japan needs to put people and planet over profit, and shift its finances from fossil fuels to renewables.”",2024-04-09T04:00:43Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/09/worlds-biggest-economies-pumping-billions-into-fossil-fuels-in-poor-nations,The Guardian
David Cameron to set out UK basis for continuing arms sales to Israel,"David Cameron will set out the UK’s reasoning for continuing to export arms to Israel on Tuesday as ministers face ongoing pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. The foreign secretary will discuss the Middle East crisis with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken, on a visit to Washington where he is also expected to give an update on the UK’s arms export regime. Downing Street said it had no plans to publish the legal advice but that it wanted to be transparent about its decision to continue exporting arms during the Gaza conflict. “We are obviously aware of the interest in this issue and we will always look to be transparent about our decisions on these matters whilst respecting the longstanding convention that we don’t publish legal advice on these issues,” the prime minister’s official spokesperson said. Rishi Sunak has come under mounting pressure from senior Conservatives – including the veteran peer Nicholas Soames and the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns – to suspend weapons exports in light of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The calls follow an attack that killed seven aid workers, including three Britons, who worked for the food charity World Central Kitchen. Keir Starmer also faces pressure to back an end to arms sales after calls for the government to consider immediate action made by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan; the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar; and the Labour MP Margaret Beckett, who was foreign secretary under Tony Blair. The UK’s arms exports regime would prevent the supply of weapons to Israel if there was a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. UK companies provide about 0.02% of Israel’s overall arms imports. The No 10 spokesperson insisted the government was “completely united” over the conflict despite claims of a cabinet split, with Lord Cameron taking a more strident approach to criticism of Israel than some of his colleagues. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, had suggested there was a “bit of relish from some people” about the opportunity to criticise Israel, although No 10 rejected the notion he was referring to Cameron. Mel Stride, a close ally of Sunak, said on Monday that Israel “abides by the rule of law” but – echoing the foreign secretary’s remarks – stressed that UK support for the country was not unconditional. The work and pensions secretary said: “We expect Israel not to do the kinds of things that happened with the aid workers, and we have made it very clear that we are appalled by what happened there.” The Israeli military has withdrawn its forces from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis but could still mount an offensive against Hamas’s last stronghold in Rafah despite the UK and US leading international pleas for restraint. After six months of conflict triggered by the 7 October massacre by Hamas in southern Israel, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Rafah. Any large-scale assault would be likely to lead to a high death toll.

He will hold talks with the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and is hoping to meet the House speaker, Mike Johnson, whose colleagues are preventing the vote on Ukraine aid. “Success for Ukraine and failure for [Vladimir] Putin are vital for American and European security,” Cameron said before his trip. “This will show that borders matter, that aggression doesn’t pay and that countries like Ukraine are free to choose their own future. “The alternative would only encourage Putin in further attempts to re-draw European borders by force, and would be heard clearly in Beijing, Tehran and North Korea.” The UK announced another £2.5bn in aid earlier this year to help Ukraine fight the Russian invasion and the EU has pledged another £43bn. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said his country would lose the war unless Congress passes the military assistance package. “If Ukraine loses the war, other states will be attacked,” he said.",2024-04-08T23:01:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/09/david-cameron-to-set-out-uk-basis-for-continuing-arms-sales-to-israel,The Guardian
Nothing beats a good chat – so long as you can walk away when things get awkward | Nell Frizzell,"While on my way to look at an iguanodon skeleton the other day, at the Museum of Natural History in Oxford, I bumped into three people I knew. Each time, I spent about two minutes in the street with them, bathed in watery spring sunshine, having the lightest sort of conversation possible. You know the sort of thing: “How was your Easter? Did you go to that ceilidh on Monday? Aren’t these sunny evenings nice? Did you know you can eat magnolia flowers?” It was perfect. Larry David may hate the stop-and-chat, but I adore it. As someone who is as easy with small talk as I am qualified to perform dentistry in North Korea, I am grateful for the fact that I can just walk away when things, inevitably, get awkward. It’s not a party, I’m not at work; I’m unlikely to get caught with this person for any longer than about five minutes. Moreover, there are buildings, trees and people around to comment on if I forget the person’s name or ask after their boyfriend, who turns out to be their ex-boyfriend, or spit in the air while trying to say the word “sophisticated”. I first bonded with my friend Zuhura over our love of the stop-and-chat. At the time, she was living on a boat; the entire Thames footpath was essentially her doorstep so she spent her life having golden nuggets of social interaction with people who were in transit. It could be political, flirtatious, heartfelt or polite, but it was always on the hoof. To have a preplanned, static conversation can sometimes be a little too intense, a bit staged. You think too much about what you are wearing, what time you will be able to eat, if you have something caught in your nostril and whether you should have sat outside. With the stop-and-chat, you each get the other as they are. It is what embeds you in a community, a landscape and a language. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get going.

"A show to relish: Tomato, the dance spectacular about lust that’s a bit like a food fight","‘How to choose tomatoes?” asks the voiceover, as three bodies writhe around the stage. “How to find the fake, acquired and invented tomato? First, the leaves. Second, the shape. Third, feel with your hand. Fourth, check the bottom. Good luck and enjoy your tomato.” The dancers twist and turn, squeezing and sucking tomatoes, throwing them or pouring a bucket of them over themselves. A live camera brings the audience into the show as the performers dance together in movements that are abstract, absurd, lustful, funny and confronting. “Every time we’re on stage,” says Chou Kuan-Jou, the Taiwanese dancer-choreographer who created the show, “we can really feel the energy from the audience because we have a lot of eye contact with them.” The show, named Tomato, is an experimental dance piece exploring sexuality, gender and desire, all influenced by how sexism, shyness and feminism affect her home country. Tomato drew rave reviews at its 2022 Edinburgh fringe festival debut, and is now returning to the UK for two shows at the Taiwan festival in London. Its creator is a young Taiwan-born artist who teaches schoolchildren and elderly women dance, as well as working with disability advocacy groups. Speaking from Taipei, Chou says Tomato was first inspired by discussions about menstruation, pregnancy, sexuality and social expectations. But as she began exploring her own sexuality, the show has morphed and the lineup has changed. Reviewers have noted the “sudden shifts” in the mood of the show, which seem to have left audiences delightfully shocked, but also a little confused by the multiple themes and the chaotically abstract performance. Chou suggests that this is a fair reflection of her own changing experience in terms of the subject matter. “Tomato is about exploring lust with a sexualising body and experimenting with the fluidity of it. In these three years, the show has been changing with my life, my personal body experience.” Tomato has also taken on darker themes, as Chou learned of disturbing online trends in Taiwan and Korea, from the sharing of videos showing violence against women to Taiwan’s belated #MeToo movement. The latter has drawn in dozens of high-profile figures, sparked a nationwide conversation and prompted changes in the law. The conversation was good and necessary, Chou says, but she would have liked to see it go further, pushing against social conservatism to more freely discuss sex and desire, particularly for women, groups such as the LGBTQ+ community and people with disabilities. Instead, it was framed around victims and perpetrators. “What about the complexity of sexuality?” she says. “That’s my goal right now, to open the discussion.” Chou says the show received a very different reception in Edinburgh, where it was met with laughter. “Sometimes I feel it’s too much,” she says. As for her more conservative home country, she says: “In Taiwan, I can feel the insecurity and intense atmosphere in the audience. They are like a big wall I have to punch through. A lot of people stay for the Q&A section, but I sense they don’t know how to transform their feelings and thoughts into words because the discussion of desire or sexuality is not really familiar in Taiwan.” Chou says her school pupils sometimes come to her for advice, or let her know they’ve seen her work online. Members of her Chinese cultural dance class have come to her shows, but they are often too shy to talk about what they saw. Another work, Free Touch, invites members of the public to sit with her and be open to making and receiving physical contact. She recently took it to Perth, Australia, setting up in a corner of Hyde Park, where some extraordinary moments of interaction occurred. “It’s a play on boundaries and trust, of intimacy in the public space. It also reminds me of a Tinder date, because sometimes you can really feel the connection.” Chou acknowledges that there is an element of risk involved. “Yeah, it’s dangerous,” she says. “But I want to see the dangers and understand them.” She pauses then adds: “I’ve also signed up for martial arts.”  The Taiwan festival runs for 15 days from 12 April at London’s Coronet theatre.

"Ex-defence ministers ‘wrong’ to say UK unprepared for war, deputy PM says","Former defence ministers are wrong to issue a stark warning that the UK is unprepared for war as a “whole-nation endeavour”, the deputy prime minister has said. The outgoing defence minister, James Heappey, called on ministers to do more to prepare for conflict just weeks after resigning from his Ministry of Defence (MoD) post, saying the UK has failed to prepare for war. His former boss Ben Wallace echoed his sentiments, suggesting some in government are just hoping threats to the UK “will go away”. Labour has described it as “an alarming admission”, adding: “The cost of Tory chaos is a government that doesn’t take the UK’s defence seriously.” Oliver Dowden hit back, saying “they are wrong”. He told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show: “We are taking action across the board. We have set up a national cybersecurity centre in respect of cyber. I now take dozens of decisions daily about investment to protect our economic security. “This world is going to get more dangerous as time goes on. We see a combination of hostile states, not least Russia, Iran, North Korea and China. “We need to be taking action across those areas. Of course there is always more to do, but I believe we are making good progress against rising threat.” Heappeywrote in the Sunday Telegraph that the UK was behind its allies who have taken steps to reinforce citizens’ preparedness for war. He wrote that he had urged ministers to prepare for conflict and take part in a “whole of government” exercise, first championed by Wallace, to practice evacuating to a bunker because of the “growing instability and insecurity directed at Britain”. But only MoD officials took part, despite certain cabinet ministers having access to reserved beds and desks in the UK’s wartime bunker. “It’s a stark reminder that war is a whole-nation endeavour and, to be frank, in the UK we’re a very long way behind,” he wrote. Wallace echoed his criticisms in the newspaper, saying there were too many people in the government relying on hoping the current instability would go away. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He said: “The growing instability and insecurity directed at Britain and her allies means that the whole of society needs to make a step change towards recognising that our core duty is to think about our defence and our resilience. “It’s how we used to think during the cold war, and everyone from local government to the MoD played their part.” A Labour spokesperson said: “Since 2010, the Conservatives hollowed out our armed forces, cut the army to its smallest size since Napoleon, wasted billions of pounds in defence procurement, and overseen service morale fall to record lows.“Labour knows the first duty of any government is to keep the nation safe and protect our citizens. We will always do what’s required to defend this country.” The government has belatedly started reviewing its national plan for the defence of the UK in the event of a war, after mounting threats of conflict. Heappey has called for a focus on strategic resilience including securing food and energy supples, more money for defence, and repurposing industry to build weapons. Rishi Sunak is under pressure to increase defence spending. Last month, Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Home Office minister Tom Tugendhat publicly called for defence spending to reach at least 2.5% of GDP.",2024-04-07T15:25:26Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/07/ex-defence-ministers-uk-unprepared-for-war-oliver-dowden,The Guardian
Fugitive CEO at the center of 2022 crypto crash found liable for fraud,"A jury in Manhattan found a Singapore-based former crypto CEO liable on civil fraud charges on Friday, agreeing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that both he and his firm misled investors before the 2022 collapse of the company’s namesake cryptocurrency wrecked cryptocurrency markets. The jury delivered the verdict in federal court after a two-week trial after hearing closing arguments earlier in the day. The Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon did not attend the trial, as he has been detained in Montenegro since March 2023. He was intercepted while on his way to Dubai on the lam from authorities in multiple countries, traveling using forged Costa Rican travel documents. The SEC accused both Terraform and Kwon of duping investors in 2021 about the stability of TerraUSD, a stable coin designed to maintain a value of $1. The regulator also alleged both had falsely claimed Terraform’s blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app. The regulator is seeking civil financial penalties and orders barring Kwon and Terraform from the securities industry. Laura Meehan, the SEC attorney, said during closing arguments that the platform’s success story was “built on lies”. “If you swing big and you miss, and you don’t tell people that you came up short. That is fraud,” Meehan said. Louis Pellegrino, an attorney for Terraform, told the jury on Friday the SEC’s case relied on statements taken out of context and that Terraform and Kwon had been truthful about their products and how they worked, even when they failed. The company issued a statement after the verdict: “We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.” Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, did not attend the trial, which began 25 March. Both the US and South Korea, where Kwon is a citizen, have sought his extradition on criminal charges. Montenegro’s top court is evaluating the competing calls for his extradition. Kwon’s attorneys have advocated for extradition to South Korea in hopes of a lighter sentence. However, Montenegro’s government plans to approve extradition to the US, Bloomberg reported. Kwon designed the cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and Luna, a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD. The SEC estimates investors lost more than $40bn on the two tokens combined when the TerraUSD peg to the dollar could not be maintained in May 2022. Their collapse also dragged down the value of other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, and caused wider havoc in the crypto market, leading several companies to file for bankruptcy in 2022. Terraform itself filed for bankruptcy protection in January. The SEC has said Kwon and Terraform secretly arranged to have a third party purchase large amounts of TerraUSD to prop up the price when the stable coin slipped from its peg a year earlier, in May 2021. Kwon falsely attributed the recovery to the reliability of TerraUSD’s algorithms, according to the regulator. Terraform’s attorney said on Friday that Terraform had disclosed TerraUSD’s peg needed to be defended in May 2021. He said the Korean payments app had used the company’s blockchain, but the technical details of how it did so were not important to investors. US financial regulators have been keen to crack down on shady crypto moguls in recent months. The ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money late last week. His company is still in the thick of contentious bankruptcy proceedings. Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said in a statement on Friday: “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance.”",2024-04-06T15:50:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/05/ceo-crypto-crash-fraud-terraform-do-kwan,The Guardian
"Russia-Ukraine war live: 20 members of Russian airfield personnel killed or injured in drone attack, Kyiv says – as it happened","Ukrainian officials claimed on Friday that the drone strike targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia had killed or injured 20 members of personnel. The officials, speaking on anonymity to the AP because they were not authorised to publicly discuss the operation, had also said the attack destroyed at least six military aircrafts and badly damaged eight others. However, Russian defence officials claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. It has just turned 6pm in Ukraine and Russia. Here are the key events you might have missed from the day: A Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia has killed or injured 20 members of airfield personnel and destroyed six Russian warplanes, as well as badly damaging eight others, according to officials in Kyiv. Russian defence officials, however, have claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged in the barrage. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. A Russian airstrike on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia has killed two people and injured six others, according to local governor. A series of blasts had been reported in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday. Reuters reported earlier in the day that Ukraine’s air force shot down all 13 drones used in Russia’s overnight attack on the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk, though nothing had been said about the missiles. Russian investigators claimed to have found pro-Ukraine data on the phone of one of the Moscow terror attack suspects, despite evidence that an offshoot of the Islamic State (IS) was responsible. Russia’s investigative committee said that data from one of the suspects’ phones showed that on the morning of 24 February this year – the second anniversary of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine – he had trawled for photographs of the Crocus City Hall and sent it to others. It said the suspect “had confirmed all this in his statements” and also said they had found photos showing men in camouflage holding the Ukrainian flag in front of destroyed buildings. Human rights experts however have warned that any statements or confessions from the suspects should be met with scepticism given that the men appeared to have been repeatedly tortured, according to gruesome videos and photographs circulating of their interrogations. A Russian governor was hospitalised after being stabbed, a spokesperson has said. Andrey Chibis, governor of far northern Murmansk was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in the town of Apatity, where he had been holding a meeting. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had “come around” after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. Chibis is a member of the United Russia ruling party and has governed Murmansk region since 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin’s Ukraine offensive. Russian forces have taken control of a settlement named Vodyane in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, according to a Russia’s defence ministry statement. The ministry provided no further ddetails of the settlement. Authorities in Russia’s eastern city of Khabarovsk declared a state of emergency in an area where a “radiation source” was found, according to Russian news agency TASS reports. It said elevated radiation levels were detected near a power pylon, approximately 2.5km (1.5 miles) from residential buildings. It also said radiation levels would be monitored for the next two days and the source of the radiation would be investigated, but nobody has been injured or exposed to radiation so far. The Kremlin called French President Emmanuel Macron’s assertions that Russia plans to disrupt the Olympics “absolutely unfounded.” Macron said on Thursday that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. When asked about Russia’s threat to the games by a reporter, Macron said, “I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information.” The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organisation said that a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian-held town of Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. In a post on X, MSF said it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”. Ukrainian military drones attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, but no serious damage was detected, Russian state media has reported, citing the plant’s press service. The Guardian could not independently verify the alleged incident. In the past, both sides have accused one other of shelling the plant, none of whose six reactors are operating. Japan announced new sanctions against Russia. Japan’s trade ministry announced the decision to ban exports of 164 goods to Russia, including automobile engine oil and optical equipment. They are also expected to ban imports of Russian nonindustrial diamonds. The Ukrainian military denied that Russian forces had entered the suburbs of Chasiv Yar, a town in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, but said there was fighting ongoing in the area. “The situation there is very difficult, the fighting continues, but they are not there,” Andriy Zadubinnyi, spokesman for Ukraine’s eastern command told Reuters. Russia’s RIA news agency cited an adviser to the Russian-appointed regional head earlier as saying that Russian forces were in the suburb of Chasiv Yar. A Russian air attack on Ukraine’s southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed two people and injured six more, the regional governor said on Friday afternoon. A nine-year-old boy and his mother were among the injured, Ivan Fedorov added on Telegram. An image posted by the governor showed a cafe with shattered windows. A series of blasts was reported in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday. The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organisation said on Friday that a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian-held town of Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. In a post on X, MSF said it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”. “This attack on our office is far from being an isolated incident. The destruction of civilian infrastructure has been a hallmark of this war for a long time,” says Vincenzo Porpiglia, emergency coordinator for MSF in Ukraine.” Ukrainian police said five civilians were wounded in the strike. 🔴 BREAKING: Today, on 5 April at around 3 am, our office in Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, was bombed and completely destroyed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week signed into law a measure lowering the country’s army mobilisation age from 27 to 25, the country’s parliament said on its website. Professional footballer Zinchenko, who has won 60 caps for Ukraine, told BBC’s Newsnight programme he would answer a call-up. “I think it’s a clear answer. I would go (to fight)“, he said. He added that former school friends were involved in the conflict. “It’s tough to understand that just recently we’ve been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,” he said. The 27-year-old former Manchester City player told the BBC he had donated about £1m ($1.25m) to help people in his country since Russia’s invasion in 2022. “I know maybe some people might think that it’s much easier … for me being here (in London) rather than being there (in Ukraine),” he said. “I really hope that this war will end soon.” Ukrainian military drones have attacked Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, but no serious damage has been detected, Russian state media reports, citing plant’s press service.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Russia considers South Korea’s decision as an unfriendly move and will respond in due course. Russia is very likely to have been behind disturbances affecting GPS navigation in the Baltic region, Germany’s defence ministry said today. “The persistent disruptions to the global navigation satellite system are very likely of Russian origin and are based on disruptions in the electromagnetic spectrum, including those originating in the Kaliningrad Oblast,” a spokesperson for the ministry told Reuters. Three civilians have been injured in Kherson, Ukrinform reported. “The Russian troops attacked Beryslav again using a drone. Three people sustained injuries from the explosives that were dropped,” Kherson’s regional military administration said.

Israel to reopen Erez crossing into Gaza | First Thing,"Good morning. The office of the Israeli prime minister has said that the Erez crossing, which lies in northern Gaza and for years served as the only passenger terminal for people to move in and out of the territory, will be temporarily reopened in an effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid. More aid will also be allowed through the port of Ashdod, which lies about 25 miles north of Gaza, and authorities will further allow “increased Jordanian aid through Kerem Shalom”, a border crossing in southern Israel. Today’s announcement came just hours after Joe Biden called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza, telling Benjamin Netanyahu in a testy meeting that future US support for Israel would depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and aid workers. How did the US react to today’s announcement? Antony Blinken welcomed the steps, but remained cautious. The US secretary of state said: “These are positive developments but the real test is results.” What’s going on at the UN regarding this conflict? The UN Human Rights Council was today debating whether to demand a halt in arms sales to Israel “to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights”. A report by Microsoft’s threat intelligence team said Chinese state-backed cyber groups would probably target high-profile elections in 2024 with artificial intelligence-generated content. China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January – the first time Microsoft has seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft. Voting rights groups have filed a federal lawsuit against Alabama to block enforcement of a new law that criminalizes some kinds of voter assistance with absentee ballots. A federal judge has ruled that a group of migrants who were sent to Martha’s Vineyard in 2022 by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, can sue the plane company that transported them. Prostate cancer cases worldwide are projected to double to 2.9m a year by 2040, with annual deaths predicted to rise by 85%, a study has found. A federal judge has denied Donald Trump’s attempts to have his classified records case dismissed on the contention that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to transform them as personal property and possess them at his Mar-a-Lago club. Despite efforts to improve air quality before the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, air pollution is still far worse in China than in many developed countries. About half of China’s cities failed to meet their own national standards in 2019 – let alone those from the World Health Organization. Despite the country’s comprehensive action plans, researchers have said air pollution deaths in China will begin to rise soon without accelerated action. “For China to even just tread water, it needs to reduce air pollution even more aggressively,” said Prof Michael Brauer from the University of British Columbia. In Tennessee, Republicans have accelerated their attacks on democratic norms, most recently expelling two Black Democratic lawmakers calling for gun reform from the state House of Representatives. They’ve maintained conservative domination in the state with gerrymandered districts, disenfranchised voters and an increasing sense of political despair – in many cases, insulating themselves from political consequences. “The leadership in the state is not the old guard,” said Dr Sekou Franklin, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University. “They’re an extreme version of conservatives who believe that they have broad sovereignty to govern, in many respects irrespective of what goes on in the national government.” In many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, hyenas are feared and denigrated. In the folklore of the Ethiopian highlands, people with the “evil eye” turn into hyenas at night and attack their neighbors. But in Harar, a walled city in eastern Ethiopia, hyenas are welcomed, acting as the city’s garbage-disposal system, entering at night through a series of “hyena doors” built into the walls and eating entrails dumped in the streets. US banks are sabotaging their climate commitments to cut back on emissions by continuing to finance meat, dairy and feed corporations, a report has found. The report has linked more than 24m metric tonnes of CO2 – about equal to the annual emissions from 5m cars – to animal protein and feed company financing by what it calls the “big three” livestock lenders: Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. “Banks have committed to pathways to net zero, but they are ignoring a huge cow-shaped hole in their plans,” said Monique Mikhail at Friends of the Earth. Adrienne Matei took on the 30-plants-a-week challenge, inspired by a 2018 study that found that those who eat a wide variety of plant foods have better gut health and that instead of the classic “five a day” goal people should strive to eat 30 plants a week. But could the challenge be easier for Adrienne than it seems, given that even a small quantity of the plant counts – and substances like coffee and tea technically go toward the tally?

"China will use AI to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India, Microsoft warns","China will attempt to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India this year with artificial intelligence-generated content after making a dry run with the presidential poll in Taiwan, Microsoft has warned. The US tech firm said it expected Chinese state-backed cyber groups to target high-profile elections in 2024, with North Korea also involved, according to a report by the company’s threat intelligence team published on Friday. “As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections,” the report reads. Microsoft said that “at a minimum” China will create and distribute through social media AI-generated content that “benefits their positions in these high-profile elections”. The company added that the impact of AI-made content was minor but warned that could change. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft. Microsoft said in the report that China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January. The company said this was the first time it had seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election. A Beijing-backed group called Storm 1376, also known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, was highly active during the Taiwanese election. Its attempts to influence the election included posting fake audio on YouTube of the election candidate Terry Gou – who had bowed out in November – endorsing another candidate. Microsoft said the clip was “likely AI generated”. YouTube removed the content before it reached many users. The Beijing-backed group pushed a series of AI-generated memes about the ultimately successful candidate, William Lai – a pro-sovereignty candidate opposed by Beijing – that levelled baseless claims against Lai accusing him of embezzling state funds. There was also an increased use of AI-generated TV news anchors, a tactic that has also been used by Iran, with the “anchor” making unsubstantiated claims about Lai’s private life including fathering illegitimate children. Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut tool, which is developed by Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Microsoft added that Chinese groups continue to mount influence campaigns in the US. It said Beijing-backed actors are using social media accounts to pose “divisive questions” and attempt to understand issues dividing US voters. “This could be to gather intelligence and precision on key voting demographics ahead of the US Presidential election,” said Microsoft in a blog post accompanying the report. One post on X, formerly Twitter, referred to a $118bn bipartisan bill in the US that combined a $20bn of investment in the US-Mexico border with a $75bn package for Ukraine and Israel. It asked: “What’s your reaction?” Another flagged the loss of an F-35 fighter in South Carolina last year, saying “only under the Biden administration” could a valuable piece of military hardware be lost – although debris was found soon after – and asked “what do you think about this?” The report was published in the same week that a White House-appointed official review board said “a cascade of errors” by Microsoft let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior US officials. Last month, the US and UK governments accused China-backed hackers of waging a years-long cyber campaign targeting politicians, journalists and businesses, as well as the UK’s election watchdog.",2024-04-05T04:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/05/china-using-ai-disrupt-elections,The Guardian
"Russia-Ukraine war: We need to do more to help Ukraine, Nato chief says – as it happened","Wrapping up a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that the situation in the battlefield in Ukraine remains serious and that Ukraine needs more air defences and assistance. We need to do even more, he said, adding that support needs to be put on a more enduring basis. Nato foreign ministers met for a second day in Brussels, marking the 75th anniversary of the alliance’s founding. The ministers held talks with Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister. Kuleba stressed Ukraine’s call for more air defences. “Saving Ukrainian lives, saving Ukrainian economy, saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of Patriots and other air defence systems in Ukraine. He also emphasised that “providing Patriots depends on allies, they have plenty of them.” The Ukrainian minister also said he spoke with the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and “urged our American partners to find ways to provide additional ‘Patriot’ air defence systems as soon as possible.” The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that “we heard loud and clear what the foreign minister said” and that Berlin will ask allies to check if they can provide more air defences. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, has said that “without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also reiterated the need for air defences. “Strengthening Ukraine’s air defence capabilities directly translates into saving lives,” he said on social media. After the ministers’ meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, emphasised that more needs to be done to help Ukraine. Allies will now go back and look into their inventories to see if there’s any way to provide more air defence systems, Stoltenberg. The Nato chief also said allies should be able to establish a stronger, more robust framework for long-term support for Ukraine, so aid can continue on a more predictable basis. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said that four people were killed and 12 were wounded in Russian drone attacks. Around 350,000 residents were without power in the Kharkiv region following the overnight drone attack, the Ukrainian energy ministry said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. Stoltenberg also said he opposes any attempt by Georgia’s government to introduce a law on foreign agents. The situation on the battlefield is difficult, Jens Stoltenberg said, stressing that there is an urgency when it comes to mobilising ore support for Ukraine. If more support is not mobilised, there is a risk that Russia captures more territory, he warned. The Ukrainians have demonstrated they are extremely capable of using the equipment provided by Nato allies, he said. The Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies need to do two things: mobilise more support for Kyiv in the coming days and weeks, and but then also ensure that we’re able to establish a stronger, more robust framework for long-term support, so aid can continue on a more predictable basis. The Nato chief reiterated that the alliance’s military leadership has been tasked with coming up with a structure, which would have to be underpinned by a financial commitment. He declined to go into more detail about plans. Asked about Ukraine’s ask for more air defences, Jens Stoltenberg said allies understand the urgency. Allies will now go back and look into their inventories to see if there’s any way to provide more systems, including Patriots, he said. It’s partly a question of systems, and partly a question of delivering interceptors, the Nato chief said, stressing recent announcements of extra support. Wrapping up a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that the situation in the battlefield in Ukraine remains serious and that Ukraine needs more air defences and assistance. We need to do even more, he said, adding that support needs to be put on a more enduring basis. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, has said that “without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism.” In a sharply-worded thread on social media, the outspoken minister said that “comforting stories can help win elections. But if they are false they immobilise us, prevent us from taking real action, while Ukrainians continue to die for us.” He added: “There is little mystery about what can happen if we keep waiting for a miracle. Territories can be lost, countries can be occupied. There is no positive spin to this story, no happy ending, unless we choose to rewrite this scrip.” Nice stories don’t win wars. Without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism. 🧵👇 Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, will soon address reporters. Stay tuned. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke with the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and “urged our American partners to find ways to provide additional ‘Patriot’ air defense systems as soon as possible.” Kuleba also noted that they “discussed next steps in the coming days and weeks to unlock supplemental US aid for Ukraine.” I was pleased to meet with @SecBlinken in Brussels to express my gratitude to the United States for all of its assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale aggression.I briefed Secretary Blinken on Russia's increased air terror against Ukrainian cities and… pic.twitter.com/8WcdgBwF1D Speaking alongside her Ukrainian counterpart, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said at Nato headquarters that “we heard loud and clear what the foreign minister said and I also would like to underline, we see what’s happening in Ukraine, realising that you need this air defence now.” She added: “We will call in Europe again that everybody has to check where their air defence is, what they can provide for Ukraine.” Together with @ABaerbock we have just attended the NATO-Ukraine council meeting in Brussels. Ukraine’s greatest need right now is to urgently strengthen air defense. I thank Germany and other allies for answering the call and taking action right away. pic.twitter.com/wgfs96Mv9k Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said China has proposed the most reasonable peace plan so far for resolving the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reported. “The most important thing for us is that the Chinese document is based on an analysis of the reasons for what is happening and the need to eliminate these root causes. It is structured in logic from the general to the specific,” state news agency RIA quoted Lavrov saying. “This plan was criticized for being vague... But this is a reasonable plan that the great Chinese civilization proposed for discussion,” he said. The EU has fired a warning shot at the Georgian government after it announced it was resurrecting a bill on “foreign agents” that it abandoned last year after critics compared it to current Russian laws silencing criticism in the media. In a statement the EU’s external service reminded Georgia that “ensuring media freedom” was one of the “crucial” conditions of the EU membership process. “The European Union recalls the public pledge of the Georgian government and the ruling party from last year to “unconditionally withdraw” such legislation. The EU regrets that it is once again being considered despite strong public and international reactions in March 2023,” it said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that critics of the draft law “need to more actively explain the absurdity of considering this a Russian project”. Peskov added that Russia wants “stability and predictability” in Georgia, and defended the proposed law, saying: “No state wants interference from other countries in domestic politics; this is normal practice.” Romania’s foreign minister, Luminița Odobescu, has called for “ambitious actions” to support Ukraine.

Our purpose at the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership,” Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian troops launched a wave of Shahed drones against Ukraine’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, overnight. Four people were killed and 12 were wounded, the regional governor has said. Watch the latest footage from the attack: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. When asked about Russia’s threat to the Olympics by a reporter, Macron said, “I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information.” His comment, delivered at an event in Paris for the inauguration of the new Olympics aquatic centre, is the most explicit acknowledgement to date of foreign threats to the security of the games. Macron has recently adopted a tougher stance on the war, vowing that Moscow must be defeated, although he has made clear that France has no intention of instigating hostilities against Russia. Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said France will propose EU-wide level sanctions on those behind spreading “disinformation”. The Finnish government will extend the closure of border crossings with Russia until further notice, the government said today, Reuters reported. “We are working with our partners to strengthen the protection of our cities and villages and to protect our citizens,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said this morning. “Strengthening Ukraine’s air defense capabilities directly translates into saving lives,” he stressed.

"Australia faces postwar-style reconstruction to reach net zero target, Greg Combet says","Australia faces a postwar-scale reconstruction costing hundreds of billions of dollars in private and public investment to reach net zero emissions by mid-century, according to the former Labor climate minister and incoming Future Fund chair, Greg Combet. Speaking at the National Press Club, Combet said the Net Zero Economy Authority – a new government agency proposed to help manage the country’s transformation from a dirty to a clean economy – was putting together a “pipeline” of clean industrial projects and would be “figuring out how to help bring them to concrete investment decisions”. Combet was speaking as the chair of the Net Zero Economy Agency, which was set up to design the authority and begin its work. Legislation to create the authority was tabled in parliament last week. A former union boss and cabinet minister in the Gillard government, Combet will leave the agency next month to succeed Peter Costello as the chair of the Future Fund, the country’s $212bn sovereign wealth fund. He said the authority had been designed to play a coordinating role in helping Australia become a renewable energy “superpower”, initially focusing on emissions-intensive parts of the country that were home to ageing coal-fired power plants that were near the end of their life. A key part of its job would be ensuring workers and communities were supported through the change and shared in the benefits, he said. “If we do this well, Australia has the opportunity to develop numerous new clean industrial projects, involving billions of investment dollars and providing thousands of jobs,” he said. “Neither government funding nor private capital alone can meet this challenge.” Combet said the agency had been involved “in the policy discussion” in the lead-up to next month’s budget, and the government had indicated it would “look to capitalise on Australia’s comparative advantage in minerals and renewable energy, aiming to encourage large-scale investment in green industrial production”. He suggested that the government and its funding bodies would need to look beyond grants and concessional loans, and should consider direct investments in “particularly large transformative projects” when necessary. “Governments may need to consider being significant equity players, helping to de-risk projects and adopting a long-term view before recovering capital,” he said. Anthony Albanese has indicated the government plans to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act, which includes A$570bn in clean incentives, but acknowledges it cannot compete with it on dollar terms. The government promised $2bn for green hydrogen production in last year’s budget and last week announced $1bn for solar manufacturing. Some economists have questioned whether these investments were well targeted given the scale of investment under way elsewhere, particularly in China and the US, and suggested Australia should focus on industries in which it could have a natural advantage, such as green iron. Combet said the US legislation had “changed the game”, and the European Union, Japan and Korea had followed with “unprecedented investments in their industrial base”. “The race is on to secure the industries of the future,” he said. “Australia needs to respond, and we are.” Sign up to Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He said the agency had begun work in Gladstone and the central Queensland region, which produces more than 40% of the state’s energy and is home to nearly half of the country’s coalmines. He said it was an example of a place that would feel the impact of what was coming but where there could be new opportunities. “It’s a major producer of key industrial products like cement, alumina, aluminium and ammonia, and it’s a major trade hub, with the Port of Gladstone facilitating tens of billions of dollars of trade every year in exports of coal, gas and aluminium to our trading partners,” he said. “In my view, successfully transforming the region around Gladstone, and similar regions around the country, must be a key national endeavour.” He said the authority legislation included a funded redeployment scheme. The body would support workers “to acquire skills, to access new employment if needed, to help create jobs in new businesses and industries”, he said. “The touchstone will be how well we handle the closure of coal-fired power stations,” he said.

"Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators review – boisterous, blues-soaked rock’n’roll","A 2011 episode of South Park took playful aim at Slash, parodying the Guns N’ Roses guitarist as a mythical Dutch legend called Vunter Slaush with the ability to perform everywhere at once. There’s truth in every joke. Between shows in South Korea and the Philippines, Slash made an impromptu appearance at the Academy Awards, flanking Ryan Gosling with a honeyburst Les Paul guitar for a performance of I’m Just Ken from the Oscar-nominated Barbie. While testament to his enduring mainstream appeal, tonight is a more orthodox setting for the legendary, top-hatted guitarist. Wolfgang Van Halen – son of late guitar hero Eddie – also rubbed shoulders with Gosling in Hollywood, and it’s his band Mammoth WVH supporting Slash and co on this latest global trek. Their brand of muscular, belligerent rock showcases Van Halen’s supreme talent, but they fail to fully ignite in a confusingly short, six-song set. Not to be confused with Slash’s other, snappier solo namesake, simply “Slash” – with which he’s recently announced an all-star blues covers album called Orgy of the Damned – “Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators” encompasses a body of work written with Alter Bridge’s Kennedy, the American hard-rock heavyweights’ much-lauded vocalist. What Kennedy lacks in attitude and the unpredictability of an Axl Rose or a Scott Weiland, he makes up for with a supple, powerhouse range perfectly suited to Slash’s bluesy pomp. Taken from the band’s latest album, 4, C’est la Vie marries Kennedy’s honeyed vocals with the guitarist’s wah-wah-heavy riffs, as he stomps around the drum riser in his Converse shoes. Since Slash cowrote it, a breezy cover of Lenny Kravitz’s Always on the Run fits in seamlessly with its swaggering rhythms. If tonight is mainly about the guitarist, then soaring power ballad Bent to Fly is all about Kennedy, as he unleashes his spectacular caterwaul. Bassist Todd Kerns has a decent set of pipes himself – he takes lead vocals for a few songs, including GNR’s Bad Apples from 1991. Wicked Stone is the band’s best song, on account of its bluesy brawn and devil-may-care riffs – it’s mesmerising to watch him in full flow, but Slash’s extended 10-minute solo is excessive. “This is why we do it,” Kennedy says, “for crowds like you. You guys are outstanding.” Born Saul Hudson in London and partly raised up the road in Stoke-on-Trent, Slash obviously has a knack for side hustles. The irony is that whether by accident or design, he’s cultivated a brand in that wherever the frizzy-haired man wearing the top hat and aviator sunglasses goes, boisterous, blues-soaked rock’n’roll is never far behind.

Zelenskiy was in Bucha today alongside prime minister Denys Shmyhal and several foreign ambassadors to mark two years since the city and surrounding areas’ were liberated from a brutal month-long occupation by Russia at the start of the war. The Ukrainian leader laid a lamp at the town’s Wall of Remembrance, which names the 509 civilians who have so far been identified of those killed during Bucha’s occupation. Russia launched 16 missiles and 11 drones at Ukraine in an overnight air attack, Ukraine’s air force said. In a statement on Telegram, the air force said it had managed to down nine of the drones and nine of the missiles. It did not identify their targets. The Russian air force conducted a massive strike on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and gas industry overnight, the Russian defence ministry said. Thousands in Ukraine’s Odesa region were temporarily left without power after debris from a downed Russian drone caused a blaze at an energy facility. Ukraine launched ten Czech-made Vampire rockets at the Russian border region of Belgorod, according to Russia’s Ministry of Defence. And Ukrainian shelling killed a woman in the village of Dunayka, Belgorod Oblast, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. France will deliver hundreds of old armoured vehicles and new surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine in its war against Russia. French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu told a French newspaper that president Emmanuel Macron had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. Protesters in Kyiv are calling for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war from the notorious Azov brigade. Relatives and friends of captured soldiers, some dressed in military clothing, waved placards at passing traffic. The Azov brigade has often been criticised for its links with Nazism and the far-right. Russia launched a “counter-terrorism operation” regime in the southern region of Dagestan, detaining three people by Sunday morning. “Security agencies detained three bandits who were planning a number of terrorist offences. During the inspection of the places where the criminals were detained, automatic weapons, ammunition and an improvised explosive device ready for use were found,” Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said, according to Russian news agencies. AP provides some more detail on president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Bucha today. Zelenskiy was in Bucha alongside prime minister Denys Shmyhal and several foreign ambassadors, to commemorate the second anniversary of the area’s liberation from Russian forces. The Ukrainian leader laid a lamp at the town’s Wall of Remembrance, the president’s website said. The monument names the 509 civilians who have so far been identified of those killed during the occupation, which lasted just over a month. Bucha’s name has come to evoke savagery by Moscow’s military since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Ukrainian troops who retook the town two years ago today found the bodies of men, women and children on the streets, in gardens and homes, as well as buried in mass graves. Some bodies showed signs of torture. Ukrainian shelling killed a woman in the Russian border village of Dunayka, the latest in a series of deadly cross-border attacks by Kyiv, AFP reports, citing the local governor. “The village of Dunayka, in the Graivoron urban district, came under Ukrainian fire. To much grief, a civilian was killed,” governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media. “She died of her wounds on the spot before the ambulance crew arrived. I express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased,” he added. Dunayka, in Belgorod oblast, is about four miles from the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian forces launched over a dozen drone and artillery strikes at the region in the past 24 hours, Gladkov said. Russian authorities said yesterday they had evacuated five thousand children from the border territory following weeks of deadly strikes that killed over a dozen people. Protesters in Kyiv are calling for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war from the Azov brigade. Relatives and friends of captured soldiers, some dressed in military clothing, waved placards at passing traffic. At its inception in 2014, the Azov brigade included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, though some have suggest fits far-right links and symbolism have remained. Speaking to commemorate the liberation of Bucha, which took place two years ago today, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said of Ukraine’s war with Russia: “This is a war for our state’s right to exist, as well as for everyone’s right to life. This is a war for the dignity of our people and every nation seeking its own destiny”. Bucha was the scene of a savage occupation by Russian forces for just over a month at the start of the invasion. After Ukraine retook the city and surrounding areas, hundreds of bodies of civilians were found, some in mass graves. “The bodies of our people, which were found on the streets of Bucha, demonstrated that no one in the world can stay away from this battle,” Zelenskiy said. “Because it is here, in Ukraine, through the defense our people, our lives, and our state, that humanity is prevailing. “To unleash such aggressions against others, Russia first destroyed its own morality and turned violence and hatred into its ideology. Such systems do not simply stop. They are brought to a stop by force. Unity stops them. Determination and an understanding of what they want to destroy is what stops them. I thank everyone in the world who really helps us.” This is a war of global significance. This is a war for our state's right to exist, as well as for everyone's right to life.

More than 200 Russian tourists have visited the pariah state so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Pjotr Sauer reports on why Pyongyang is has opened its arms to Russian visitors. Gliding down pristine, untouched mountain runs, Olga Shpalok said she was “getting 100% satisfaction”. After a full day of skiing, the Russian designer from Vladivostok wound down with a visit to her hotel’s well-equipped spa and sauna. “They said it was very hard to get into the country. But fate smiled upon us,” she said. Shpalok was part of the first group of foreign tourists to visit North Korea since it shut down its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020. In early February, she travelled to the country with 100 other Russian tourists on a four-day skiing trip summed up by the Russian embassy as “Pyongyang opens its doors”. More than 200 Russian tourists have visited North Korea so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Their interviews and accounts give a rare insight into life in Kim Jong-un’s regime. Closely watched by government “minders”, who restricted what they could see and where they could go, the Russian tourists described spending time in otherwise empty luxurious ski resorts. Some said they felt deep unease over the poverty and total control they witnessed. Russia’s access to the pariah state is no coincidence. It comes at a time when the two countries have been moving closer at an unprecedented pace, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. North Korea has emerged as Russia’s largest supplier of weapons, shipping artillery shells, missiles and other equipment for Moscow’s continuing war. In exchange, Russia appears to be sending North Korea food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, bypassing international sanctions imposed on the country. The Russian tourist groups visiting North Korea illustrate another way Moscow can help Pyongyang. Before the pandemic, an estimated 5,000 westerners visited North Korea every year as part of pricey tours but since Covid-19 the borders have been sealed.

In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche, a French Sunday newspaper launched last year, French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu said that president Emmanuel Macron had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. “The Ukrainian army needs to defend a very long front line, which requires armoured vehicles; this is absolutely crucial for troop mobility and is part of the Ukrainian requests,” he said. He said France was looking at providing hundreds of VAB (Véhicule de l’Avant Blindé) front-line troop carriers in 2024 and early 2025.",2024-03-31T14:59:52Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/31/russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates,The Guardian
‘Luxury’ skiing in North Korea: the Russians allowed behind the border,"Gliding down pristine, untouched mountain runs, Olga Shpalok said she was “getting 100% satisfaction”. After a full day of skiing, the Russian designer from Vladivostok wound down with a visit to her hotel’s well-equipped spa and sauna. “They said it was very hard to get into the country. But fate smiled upon us,” she said. Shpalok was part of the first group of foreign tourists to visit North Korea since it shut down its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020. In early February, she travelled to the country with 100 other Russian tourists on a four-day skiing trip summed up by the Russian embassy as “Pyongyang opens its doors”. More than 200 Russian tourists have visited North Korea so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Their interviews and accounts give a rare insight into life in Kim Jong-un’s regime. Closely watched by government “minders”, who restricted what they could see and where they could go, the Russian tourists described spending time in otherwise empty luxurious ski resorts. Some said they felt deep unease over the poverty and total control they witnessed. Russia’s access to the pariah state is no coincidence. It comes at a time when the two countries have been moving closer at an unprecedented pace, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. North Korea has emerged as Russia’s largest supplier of weapons, shipping artillery shells, missiles and other equipment for Moscow’s continuing war. In exchange, Russia appears to be sending North Korea food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, bypassing international sanctions imposed on the country. The Russian tourist groups visiting North Korea illustrate another way Moscow can help Pyongyang. Before the pandemic, an estimated 5,000 westerners visited North Korea every year as part of pricey tours but since Covid-19 the borders have been sealed. Faced with increasingly tightening international sanctions and a reported food crisis triggered by the pandemic isolation, any hard currency is a welcome addition to Pyongyang’s cash-strapped coffers. “It’s a telling reflection of the regime’s priorities that North Korea has opted to allow Russian tourists access, yet continues to rebuff appeals from humanitarian organisations pleading for entry,” said Hanna Song, of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights in Seoul. The group tours, first announced in January by several Russian tourist agencies, cost $750 (£600). This includes the round-trip air fare to Pyongyang, North Korea’s sole international airport in the capital. Also covered were the domestic flight to the ski resort on North Korea’s eastern coast, the hotel stay, and meals. The $40 daily ski pass, souvenirs and other expenses, including alcohol and cigarettes, were paid out of pocket in cash. The tours begin with a two-hour flight from the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok to Pyongyang, operated by the North Korean state-owned Air Koryo airlines. It is made up of an ageing fleet of mostly Russian-made Tu-154 aircraft. “When I boarded the plane, I wondered if we were going to make it at all,” recalled Alexandra Daniyelko, a PR manager from Moscow who joined one of the tours. On arrival at Pyongyang, the Russian tourists visited central Kim Il-sung Square, bowed to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il on Mansu Hill and attended a youth musical performance at the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where members of communist youth groups put on patriotic music and dance performance. These carefully staged shows are traditionally steeped in government propaganda aimed at instilling North Koreans with national pride and loyalty to Kim’s family, which has ruled ruthlessly since it came to power in 1948. “I cried at the purity, kindness and talent of these kids,” said Daniyelko, describing the performance. Another Russian tourist described the children as “perfectly disciplined and obedient”, adding that the local minders confiscated the chocolates that some Russian tourists brought for the children. But for many on the trip, the holiday truly kicked off on the second day, when the tourists boarded an internal flight to the coastal town of Wonsan near the Masikryong ski resort. The resort is one of the large-scale construction projects built at the behest of Kim in recent years, thought to have cost £24m. Guests are ferried to the slopes on old Austrian-made gondolas imported from China. Ahead of the resort’s opening in 2014, a ski-less Kim was photographed in a lift chair smoking a cigarette. The Russian tourists were told they would be staying at a “five-star Swiss Alps-style resort” which was built on the orders of Kim, himself educated in Switzerland. Images published on Instagram showed polished hotel rooms, a modern swimming pool, a sauna, a massage area and a hair salon. “There weren’t any people on the main slopes, which was just perfect,” said Yekaterina Kolomeetsa, a travel blogger from Vladivostok. Empty ski pistes are hardly surprising considering that there are reportedly just 5,500 skiers among a population of 24 million. Despite North Korea’s best efforts to present a highly curated image of their country, some Russian tourists said they left disturbed. “You could sense hopelessness and constant control in the country during the entire trip,” said Shpalok. In Pyongyang, as she rode on a bus with other tourists, she said she rarely saw any cars or people on the roads. “We asked our guides where everyone was. They told us people were happily at work.” The tourists were strictly forbidden from filming ordinary houses or people and couldn’t venture on walks alone. The few people Shpalok did see looked “short and hungry”, while some children were “barely dressed” despite the cold. Yulia Mishkova, another Russian tourist, said the trip was worth it for those “looking for a dose of absurdity”. “I just felt sorry for the frightened North Koreans,” Mishkova said, adding that it was hard to ignore the fact that her daily ski pass cost more than the average monthly salary. “I will not go again for moral and ethical reasons.” Still, both countries appear to have big plans for the future. According to a report by the government of Primorsky Krai, a region in Russia’s far east on the border of the two countries, North Korea is also building another mass ski resort for Russian tourists that will include 17 hotels, 37 guesthouses and 29 shops. Tatyana Markova, a representative of the Vostok Intur travel agency, said two hiking trips to North Korea have already been planned for the Russian holidays in May. “This is just the start,” said a recent advertisement promoting the May tours to North Korea. “Make sure you book your spot fast!”",2024-03-31T12:02:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/31/luxury-skiing-in-north-korea-the-russians-allowed-behind-the-border,The Guardian
‘My jaw dropped’: Annie Jacobsen on her scenario for nuclear war,"Annie Jacobsen was a high school student in 1983, when ABC television broadcast the film The Day After, about the horrors of nuclear war. She never forgot the experience. More than 100 million Americans watched and were terrified too. One of them lived in the White House. According to his biographer and his own memoirs, it helped turn Ronald Reagan into a nuclear disarmer in his second term. Not long after, the world’s stockpile of nuclear warheads peaked and began to decline rapidly, from 70,000 to just over 12,000 currently, according to the Federation of American Scientists. That is still enough however to reduce the Earth to a radioactive desert, with some warheads left over to make it glow. Meanwhile, the global situation is arguably the most dangerous since the Cuban missile crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine grinding on mercilessly and China contemplating following Moscow’s example by making a grab for Taiwan. The danger of nuclear war is as immediate as ever but it has faded from public discourse, which is why Jacobsen, now a journalist and author, felt driven to write her new book, Nuclear War: A Scenario. “For decades, people were under the assumption that the nuclear threat ended when the Berlin Wall went down,” Jacobsen said, before suggesting another reason the existential threat of nuclear weapons has been filtered out of mainstream discourse – it has been turned into a technical debate. “​​Nuclear weapons and the whole nomenclature around them have been so rarefied it’s been reserved as a subject for those in the know,” she said. In her book, Jacobsen seeks to break through jargon and details in order to tell a terrifying story in a devastatingly straightforward way. The spoiler alert is that it doesn’t end well. As the book promises on the cover, it presents a single scenario for a nuclear war, set in the present day. North Korea, perhaps convinced it is about to be attacked, launches a surprise missile strike against the US, leading Washington to respond with a salvo of 50 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These are aimed at North Korea’s weapons sites and command centres, but in order to reach their intended targets the missiles have to fly over Russia, because they do not have the range to use any other route. All too aware of the danger of miscalculation, the US president tries to get hold of his Russian counterpart. But the two men and the countries they run are not getting on, and he fails. Making things even worse, Russia’s dodgy satellite early warning system, Tundra, has exaggerated the scale of the US salvo, and from his Siberian bunker, the Russian president (Vladimir Putin in all but name) orders an all-out nuclear attack on the US. The scenario is based on known facts concerning the world’s nuclear arsenals, systems and doctrine. Those facts are all in the public domain, but Jacobsen believes society has tuned them out, despite (or perhaps because of) how shocking they are. Jacobsen was stunned to find out that an ICBM strike against North Korea would have to go over Russia, and that Russia’s early warning system is beset with glitches, an especially worrying fact when combined with the knowledge that both the US and Russia have part of their nuclear arsenals ready to launch at a few minutes’ notice. Both also have an option in their nuclear doctrine to “launch on warning”, without waiting for the first incoming warhead to land. A US president would have a few minutes to make a decision if American early warning systems signaled an incoming attack. In those few minutes, he or she would have to process an urgent, complex and inevitably incomplete stream of information and advice from top defence officials. Jacobsen points out that in such circumstances the president is likely to be subject to “jamming”, a chorus of military voices urging he or she follows protocols which lead inexorably towards a retaliatory launch. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “My jaw dropped at so much of what I learned, which was not classified but had just been removed or rather sanitised from the public discourse,” she said. “I found myself constantly surprised by the insanity of what I learned, coupled with the fact that it’s all there for the public to know.” Ultimately, only presidents can make the decision and once it is made, no one has the authority to block it. It is called sole authority, and it is almost certainly the most frightening fact in the world today. It means a handful of men each have the power to end the world in a few minutes, without having to consult anyone. It is not a group anyone would choose to have that responsibility, including as it does the likes of Putin and Kim Jong-un. In Washington it is a choice this year between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They all bring a lot of human frailty, anger, fear and paranoia to a potential decision that could end the planet. “You would want to have a commander-in-chief who is of sound mind, who is fully in control of his mental capacity, who is not volatile, who is not subject to anger,” Jacobsen said, referring to this year’s presidential election. “These are significant character qualities that should be thought about when people vote for president, for the simple reason that the president has sole authority to launch nuclear weapons.” Nuclear War: A Scenario is published in the US by Dutton Nuclear War is published in the UK by Transworld Publishers Ltd, £20.

Israel alone? Allies’ fears grow over conduct – and legality – of war in Gaza,"When Gilad Erdan, the Israeli envoy to the UN, sat before the security council to rail against the ceasefire resolution it had just passed, he cut a lonelier figure than ever in the cavernous chamber. The US, Israel’s constant shield at the UN until this point, had declined to use its veto, allowing the council’s demand for an immediate truce – even though it contained, as Erdan furiously pointed out, no condemnation of the Hamas massacre of Israelis that had begun the war. That had been a red line for the US until Monday, as had making a ceasefire conditional on a release of hostages. But after nearly six months of constant bombing, with more than 32,000 dead in Gaza and a famine imminent, those red lines were allowed to fade, and the American ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, kept her hand still when the chair called for votes against the resolution. The message was clear: time was up on the Israeli offensive, and the Biden administration was no longer prepared to let the US’s credibility on the world stage bleed away by defending an Israeli government which paid little, if any, heed to its appeals to stop the bombing of civilian areas and open the gates to substantial food deliveries. “This must be a turning point,” the Palestinian envoy, Riyad Mansour, told the security council, mourning those who had died in the time it had taken its members to overcome their differences. For the next few days, there were other signs that the west was changing its position, at least in terms of its rhetoric. On Tuesday, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, announced that Berlin would be dispatching a delegation to remind Israel pointedly of its obligations under Geneva conventions, and warned the country not to proceed with a planned offensive on the city of Rafah, in the very south of Gaza. It was a notable change in tone from a country that has been Israel’s second biggest supporter and arms supplier. Meanwhile, in the UK, foreign secretary David Cameron has been ratcheting up his criticism of Israel – particularly over its blocking of aid into Gaza – while at the same time being ultra-careful to deflect questions as to whether the Foreign Office now believes Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has been breaching international humanitarian law. Trying to strike that balance has created real and increasingly obvious strains within the British government, and the Tory party. This definite shifting of international positions has, however, changed nothing as yet for the 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza. The bombing and sniping have not stopped. The politicians may be recalibrating, but not fast enough for those in the line of fire. In the 48 hours after the security council applauded itself for passing the ceasefire resolution, 157 ­people in Gaza were killed. Eighteen of them, including at least nine children and five women, died when a house full of displaced people was bombed in northern Rafah. Twelve people drowned trying to reach airdropped food parcels that had fallen into the sea. The number of trucks crossing into Gaza rose slightly to about 190 a day – less than half the peacetime daily total. Israeli inspectors were still turning back 20 to 25 each day, NBC News reported, citing an Egyptian aid official, on grounds as arbitrary as the wooden pallets bearing the food not being exactly the right dimensions. Israel has banned Unrwa, the main UN relief agency in the region, from using the crossing. A US state department official told Reuters on Friday that famine had already taken hold in some parts of Gaza, echoing a similar finding last week by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Four days on from the passing of the security council resolution, more US arms deliveries were being reported by the Washington Post, including 1,800 MK84 2,000lb bombs – massive munitions that are implicated in numerous mass ­casualty events over the course of the Gaza war. Furthermore, despite the UN vote just days before, the Biden administration has made it clear to its allies that threatening to stop weapons supplies to Israel as leverage is off the table, at least for now. The president told a fundraising event on Thursday: “You can’t forget that Israel is in a position where its very existence is at stake.” In the UK, however, there is a growing sense that the legal issues, and related questions about arms sales, cannot be avoided, or fudged, for much longer. As the Observer reports this weekend, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Alicia Kearns – a former employee of the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence – told a Tory fundraising event in north London on 13 March that Cameron’s department has been given legal advice that Israel has broken international humanitarian law, but has chosen not to make it public. That claim will send shudders through London and Washington, as it strikes at the heart of one of the most sensitive issues in international diplomacy. In January, appearing before Kearns’s committee, Cameron dodged questions on the issue of whether he had seen such legal advice, saying “I cannot recall every single piece of paper that has been put in front of me … I don’t want to answer that question.” Even then, in that same hearing – and before he became as vocal as he is now – he did concede that he was “worried” that Israel might have been in breach. It is not difficult to understand why the Foreign Office and Cameron may be being opaque. The existence of such advice, and any open acknowledgment of it, would trigger a series of requirements on ministers, not the least of which would be the duty to halt all British arms sales to Israel. Indeed, even if the legal advice suggested there was a “risk” of Israel having been in breach, it would have to stop exports. Some say the UK would even have to cease sharing intelligence with the US because the US might hand it on to Israel. In a recent letter to Cameron, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, homed in on this same point about arms exports, referring to criterion 2c of the UK’s Strategic Export Licensing Criteria, which requires the government to “not grant a licence if it determines there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law”. Criterion 2c adds that “the government will also take account of the risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women or children”. Lammy said that this was “particularly relevant, given that women and children constitute a majority of the victims of the war in Gaza”. Many Tory MPs are worried that Cameron might be about to announce an embargo on the sale of arms to Israel. At a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers on Monday, the foreign secretary denied he was thinking anything of the sort, although Foreign Office officials say it cannot be out of the question if Israel carries out its threat to attack Rafah. Just as in the US, the UK’s tone may be shifting to one that is more critical of Israel. But creating the political space to match this with openness about the legal advice being given, and then taking ­consequent action, will prove far more difficult. For its part, Israel has been roundly criticised, but it is still far from a pariah. Netanyahu and his war cabinet continue to insist that Israel will press ahead with an offensive on Rafah, where more than a million displaced civilians have taken shelter, shrugging off US warnings that it would be a “mistake” which would backfire on Israeli security. Two Israeli ministers are due in Washington to discuss the planned offensive in the coming week, on a visit which Netanyahu had initially cancelled in protest at the Biden administration’s abstention at the security council. American officials say they will use the meetings to present an alternative blueprint for counter-insurgency against Hamas in Rafah, focusing on precision raids on senior Hamas figures, but they admit they have no way to oblige their visitors to take the suggestions seriously. “They are a sovereign state. We will not interfere with their military planning, but we will outline in general terms what we think is another way to go to better achieve the same aims,” a US official said. In further apparent defiance of Washington’s views, the Israeli military are carving out a buffer zone around Gaza’s borders which would take up 16% of the whole coastal strip, according to Haaretz. Israeli public opinion has to date shown itself largely impervious to US and other international pressure, and support for the Gaza war currently hovers at around 80%. Even more concerning for Washington’s hopes of containing the conflict, there is also more than 70% Israeli public support for a large-scale military operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon – something Washington has so far managed to forestall. In Israel itself, pro-war demonstrators are far more in evidence than anti-war ones. Israeli settlers and rightwing activists have focused their protests on Unrwa over the past week, blocking the entrances to its Jerusalem office. The protesters portrayed the UN ceasefire resolution as an attack against Israel. “If you look at the number of UN condemnations against Israel versus the number of condemnations against North Korea or Syria, you can see how they are obsessed with us, and this is another proof of their obsession,” said Roei Ben Dor, a 21-year-old from the central Israeli town of Gedera. “We should be in Gaza, not just because of Hamas but because Gaza is ours. We have every right to take Gaza, to take Rafah. This is our land.” Aynat Libman, a 52-year-old Israeli settler from Efrat, argued the resolution simply proved the UN’s inherent antisemitism. “How could the UN possibly say we should stop the war before we are done protecting ourselves?” Libman said. “We can do this on our own. But, of course, it would be nice if we had the support.’’ The absence of bite in the international community’s reprimands has emboldened the current Israeli coalition’s sense of immunity from global public opinion, but the onset of full-scale famine, or an offensive on Rafah, could bring a much sharper response from Israel’s friends and adversaries. And there are signs that the real damage done to Israel’s global standing could worsen over time, with possibly far-reaching consequences. Michael Sfard, an Israeli Human Rights lawyer and expert in international humanitarian law says the “international community has miserably failed to prevent the deterioration of the Israeli Palestinian conflict to the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza today’’. He added: “The security council resolution is an important step in the right direction. The question is whether the parties to the conflict will be held accountable if they fail to abide to it.’’ As in the UK, tension in the US is building around the question of international law. Last week, a state department human rights official resigned, saying that the government was flouting domestic legislation prohibiting military assistance to any foreign army units implicated in atrocities, or to any country which impedes “the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance”. The official, Annelle Sheline, said the state department had evidence of violations, but it was being suppressed. “I think some of these internal processes are not going to become public until the White House is willing for them to come out,” Sheline said. The state department has said in the past week that its review process had so far provided no reason to doubt that formal Israeli assurances that it is complying with international humanitarian law, as required under US statute, are “credible and reliable”. But a full report on those assurances is not due until 8 May, which could become a point of leverage on Israel if there is no breakthrough in the provision of food relief to Gaza. “That is what you have to look for,” said Aaron David Miller, a former state department negotiator now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But Miller added: “I would be stunned if the administration made a judgment that the Israelis are out of compliance.” But the other potential shift with long-term ramifications for Israel’s future is the changing attitudes of young Americans, many of whom have jettisoned the pro-Israel reflexes of their parents, and have made Gaza an issue with protest votes in the Democratic presidential primary. A recent Gallup poll found 63% of Americans aged 18-34 disapproved of Israeli military action, as did 55% overall of those questioned. “We are witnessing an unprecedented moment of collective awareness about the ongoing occupation and apartheid conditions in Israel-Palestine,” said Rae Abileah, a progressive US Jewish activist. “I have never seen this level of people consistently taking to the streets. For years, you could say: ‘You can be progressive except on Palestine.’ We can’t say that any more.” She added: “The writing is more on the wall than it’s ever been.”",2024-03-31T05:00:31Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/31/israel-alone-allies-fears-grow-over-conduct-and-legality-of-war-in-gaza,The Guardian
"Le Crookie: after the cronut and the cruffin, latest croissant hybrid takes Paris by storm","It was 3 February when the queues started forming at Boulangerie Louvard in Paris. Even in the sort of downpour that usually empties streets, clued-up teenagers gathered outside the family-run bakery in the 9th arrondissement, desperate to get their hands on one thing: its owner Stéphane Louvard’s invention, le crookie. It’s a crisp croissant filled with American-style cookie dough, then baked to achieve a soft, gooey centre, and a video of the Frankensteined pastry had gone viral on TikTok. Arriving a decade after the New York-based French pastry chef Dominique Ansel revealed the recipe for his cronut, the crookie is the latest in a long line of hybrid croissant offerings to cause international fervour. “We were very surprised,” says Louvard, who now sells up to 2,200 crookies per day. “We had to hire two additional people to be able to produce the necessary quantities. It was a little stressful.” Bakeries across Paris have now started selling them. “My local is doing it, even though it’s not very trendy at all,” says Houssine Bouchama, director of Time Out Paris. Meanwhile, from Singapore to Toronto, copycats are making their own versions. Cookie Crumble, a micro-bakery in London, has been getting orders from across the country. Rhiain Gordon, founder of Babyfaced Baker in Edinburgh tells me it’s “unusual to see any left by 10am”. To say that cross-bred takes on classic breakfast pastries have captured public imagination is an understatement. In 2013, when Ansel first brought the cronut, with its glazed doughnut outside and flaky pastry inside, to New York, they sold out so quickly that a black market arose on advertising website Craigslist. By the time it landed in the UK in 2016, it was with so much fanfare that Londoners skipped work to try it. A muffin-croissant hybrid, the cruffin, was next, causing such a stir at Mr. Holmes Bakehouse in San Francisco that in 2015 the recipe was reportedly stolen. Then came the croloaf (croissant dough baked in a bread tin, debuted by M&S in 2016). There have been tacros (pulled pork filled taco-shaped croissants created by San Francisco’s Vive La Tarte) and cretzels (salted pretzels made with croissant dough, by Seattle’s Coyle’s Bakeshop). Since the global launch of TikTok in 2017, the appetite for these hybrid snacks has accelerated. In 2022, the suprême – a spiral of croissant dough stuffed with the pastry creme-filling of an Italian bomboloni doughnut – became a global sensation. Next came the croffle; croissant dough pressed in a waffle machine, popularised in South Korea by cafe chain Aufglet. What is it about hybrid croissants that have captured global public imagination for so long? Meg Palmer, a research manager at market research agency Verve, thinks it’s because “there’s something about the merging that makes it more permissible to be indulgent”. Pastries are also perfect for TikTok, she explains, because they look and sound great. “[In videos of] the crookie you see hands breaking through the croissant. You hear that initial crunch, and you see whether it’s got filling if it oozes out. It’s very sensorial.” She ties the constant invention of hybrids to small businesses trying to stand out on social media. “They’re always thinking ‘what can be our hook?’ People do latch on to these trends, and they don’t just want a flat white and a croissant any more.” Bouchama has seen the impact of this in Paris. “There’s an Americanisation of French patisserie going on; the desire to reach an international audience on TikTok,” he says. Bakery Philippe Conticini in Islington is London’s main purveyor of novelty croissants. The chain launched in London in 2020 with classic French patisserie, but found it hard to survive. “We’ve found we have to be creative all the time and follow the trends,” says Ludovic Carassi Del Villar, operations manager. The shop soft-launched its £5.90 crookie last week and is already getting calls demanding more. Back in Paris, TikTokers are already moving on, says Bouchama: “Some bakeries are now experimenting with the pain au chocolat-brownie.”",2024-03-30T15:00:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/30/le-crookie-after-the-cronut-and-the-cruffin-latest-croissant-hybrid-takes-paris-by-storm,The Guardian
"‘I’m just having fun’: Mohammed Kudus on goals, Ghana and his celebrations","Some defenders bounce off Mohammed Kudus and most end up bewitched by his footwork. West Ham’s Ghanaian sensation is an intriguing mix of strength, skill and imagination. His technique makes him one of the most dangerous players in the Premier League but Kudus believes his steely edge owes much to his upbringing in Nima, a place that teaches you to stand up for yourself from an early age. “Mentally it’s a very tough area,” he says. “You have to be very tough to live there. If you are soft people walk on you. It has an impact on how I play. In 50-50 challenges I don’t want to lose it. I work on my body and make sure I am very strong on the ball.” Kudus, who has been outstanding since joining West Ham last summer, laughs when he remembers the football back home. “There are no rules over there!” he says. “It’s all in. You have to be very strong.” Nima, a market town in the greater Accra region of Ghana, has a difficult reputation. “When you say Nima it’s like there’s a lot of violence happening there, it’s like a ghetto and you need to be street smart and tough to stay there,” Kudus says. He is out to change perceptions. “There’s a lot of professional players from there,” the 23-year-old adds. “It’s why I always keep mentioning where I come from. There can be talent as well.” Kudus is a role model. He loves connecting with his roots but it is no longer possible for him to live his old life when he visits home. He is too famous to do normal stuff – “like going by the roadside to get some food” – but his heart is there. A mural of Kudus went up in Nima after he scored in Ghana’s win over South Korea in the 2022 World Cup; he does not feel weighed down by being a champion to so many. “It’s my responsibility to share my story and represent where I’m from,” he says. “I don’t feel it’s a burden. It’s a responsibility that comes with the position that God has put me into. I’m just trying to put more light on to this area, get more scouts there and engage more young footballers there.” Kudus, whose footballing journey began when he joined Strong Tower FC at the age of 10, wants to give back. “Any time I’m in Ghana I visit my old club,” he says. “I have my project with Puma. We had a partnership where I got kits and boots at the end of every season and take it back to my home town. When I was growing up not all the guys had football boots and they couldn’t play. Some played in bare feet. I try to help.” Kudus is funny, smart and confident, but he is humble. He thinks about his family – his mother, Mariam, his brothers, Rahman and Fatawu, and his sister, Miyuna. He remembers being away from them after joining Ghana’s Right to Dream academy. “It comes down to sacrifices,” Kudus says. “I moved to the academy when I was 11 or 12, and I had to stay far away from home. Sometimes I’d go home just two times a year. “It was very difficult not to see my family. I remember sometimes wanting to go back home. As time went on I realised everything I was doing was for them. It would definitely have an impact on their lives. That kept me going.” The hard work was worth it. Kudus moved to the Danish club Nordsjaelland in 2018. “Very cold,” he says of Denmark. “But there was no turning back. “I was there for two seasons and in my first season I wasn’t playing much. I needed time to get used to everything. I played a little bit at the end of the season and the following season I was really settled. I needed time to get used to the culture, the weather. It was snowing, your boots are freezing, you don’t even feel it when you touch the ball.” Kudus used the ball well enough to earn a move to Ajax in 2020. He impressed in the Netherlands, grabbing attention when he scored at Anfield when Ajax faced Liverpool in the Champions League last season. Arsenal, Brighton and Chelsea looked at Kudus but West Ham made the strongest pitch. Tim Steidten, the club’s technical director, got a £37m deal over the line. “I was ready to make that step after the season I had at Ajax,” Kudus says. “I’m a player who doesn’t want to be in my comfort zone. I could have stayed at Ajax. I knew the league, I knew the club. But I don’t want to be complacent and comfortable. I always want to challenge myself. “All the clubs you mentioned, it’s true they were in contact. But when West Ham came it moved fast and I made my decision based on speaking to people around the club, their project and how they see me as a player. “I made the decision based on my gut feeling. That’s how I make my decisions. Whatever the ramifications are, I take it upon myself.” Kudus’s hunch looks good so far. David Moyes bedded him in slowly, waiting until October to give the Ghana international his first start, but there was no holding Kudus back once he was in the team. He scored his 13th goals in all competitions in West Ham’s visit to Newcastle on Saturday. “At Ajax, it was one of the biggest clubs in the league and if you went in 60%, 70% you were still going to win,” Kudus says. “But here even the small teams can surprise. You can’t switch off. I love it, it keeps me on my toes and I want it that way.” Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Kudus calls Luke Shaw, the Manchester United defender, his toughest opponent. He thinks about scoring a stunning overhead kick against Brentford in November. “Stuff like that is just instinct, you know,” he says. “It’s in two or three seconds. When the ball was coming – ‘Bicycle kick – yeah!’ It’s beautiful when it works.” Was it better than running from his own half and scoring a solo goal when West Ham thumped Freiburg in the last 16 of the Europa League last month? “No, no … I watched Messi do that a lot so, doing it one time, it’s in my books! When I took the ball I didn’t think I was going all the way to goal. But it was getting closer and closer and after the last defender I was thinking: ‘Yeah, I have to score this’. If I didn’t score that … nah. I’m glad I calmly finished it off.” At this stage it is worth pointing out that Kudus is not a luxury player. Moyes loves his workrate. Kudus understands the game. His favourite position is midfield but he has mostly played as a winger for West Ham. He says being wide makes him unpredictable. He has linked brilliantly with Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paquetá. “He is like the magnet between the back and the forwards,” Kudus says of Paquetá. “When he is on I know I can run and the ball will come.” Kudus is thinking big. West Ham are seventh in the league and face Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League quarter-finals next month. “We’re challenging for Europe in the league and we’re going for the cup,” Kudus says. He is ready for the run-in. He was low after Ghana’s early exit in the African Cup of Nations and he was not at his best after returning to West Ham. “As human beings we need some time to shake stuff off,” Kudus says. “I was injured before Afcon and had to put all my effort into being there to help the team. It was my first Afcon and it didn’t go as planned. When you go back straight into playing nobody ever gives you time to change gear. It had an impact because it was a big disappointment.” Kudus is revving up again, although he likes to slow down when he scores a goal. His trademark celebration is to sit on the advertising hoardings and wait for his teammates to mob him. “I just thought about something out of the box and then some other people followed it up,” Kudus says. “Now there’s a conversation about whose is better. I’ll have to come up with another juice and put more spices in the tin. It’s all about resting after scoring a goal. “There’s no deeper meaning. I just see it as entertainment, something to make people happy and worth the ticket that they bought. I’m still just having fun in the playground.” Did he notice Manchester United players copying him when West Ham lost at Old Trafford in January? “They’re allowed to do it,” Kudus says. “But soon they will have to start paying taxes.”",2024-03-29T20:00:49Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/29/west-ham-mohammed-kudus-on-goals-ghana-and-his-celebrations,The Guardian

"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukrainian hydropower plants attacked in overnight Russian strikes, says Zelenskiy – as it happened","Nato member Romania said it had found fragments of what appeared to be a drone on a farm near the river Danube and the border with Ukraine late on Thursday. Russia has been striking targets in western and central Ukraine with missile and drone attacks conducted at night. “In the evening of 28 March 2024, fragments that seem to come from an aerial device (drone) were identified on an agricultural land in Insula Mare a Brailei,” Romania’s defence ministry said in a statement. “The Ministry of National Defence, together with specialized structures within the National Defence System, public order and national security, is conducting an investigation of the incident.” Nato has a mutual defence commitment if one of its members comes under attack, but the Atlantic alliance and Romanian officials have said following similar such incidents in the past that they have found no evidence of any deliberate attack targeting Romania. Russia is outgunning Ukrainian forces sixfold on the front lines, causing losses of troops and positions, Ukraine’s recently appointed commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a rare interview published on Friday. Ukraine has received a $1.5 billion (£1.19 billion) tranche of funding under a World Bank programme, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday, helping it pay for its budget and social spending as it defends itself against the Russian invasion. Nato member Romania said it had found fragments of what appeared to be a drone on a farm near the river Danube and the border with Ukraine late on Thursday. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said in a statement that energy facilities in six Ukrainian regions had been attacked in Russian missile and drone attacks. Ukraine’s foreign minister concluded his visit to New Delhi on Friday after talks on bolstering trade and the war with Russia, India’s traditional ally. India has shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, even as it has pursued greater security ties with the United States. But Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar said on social media that talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba had “reiterated our commitment to strengthen the overall relationship with Kyiv”. “Our immediate goal is to get trade back to earlier levels,” he added. Russian prosecutors have asked the justice ministry to consider labelling Alla Pugacheva, the queen of Soviet pop music, as a “foreign agent”, a move that would officially designate Russia’s most famous star a foe of the Kremlin. Pugacheva, known across generations for hits such as the 1982 song “Million Scarlet Roses” and the 1978 film “The Woman who Sings”, has expressed disgust with the Ukraine war. In 2022, she said the war was killing soldiers for illusory aims, burdening ordinary people and turning Russia into a pariah. Earlier this month, the 74-year-old said that no normal person would return to Russia. She is currently abroad. Vitaly Borodin, an activist who heads an anti-corruption group and who regularly appears on state television, submitted an official request to recognise Pugacheva as a foreign agent. Then Borodin published a letter from the prosecutor general’s office showing that a request had been made to the justice ministry to consider that. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had heard no official statements about the issue. Pugacheva, thought to be in Cyprus, did not immediately comment. Russia is outgunning Ukrainian forces sixfold on the front lines, causing losses of troops and positions, Ukraine’s recently appointed commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a rare interview published on Friday. “A few days ago, the enemy’s advantage in terms of ammunition fired was about six to one,” Syrsky told the Ukrinform news agency. “The defence forces are now performing tasks along the entire vast front line, with little or no weapons and ammunition,” he warned, saying the situation was “tense” in some areas. Syrsky took over as commander-in-chief in February after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his popular predecessor, Valery Zaluzhny. The European Parliament came under pressure on Friday to investigate a Russia-financed network that wielded influence across Europe and involved EU lawmakers. The Czech Republic said on Wednesday its spies discovered the network had been spreading Russian propaganda through the Prague-based Voice of Europe news site. The Greens said there needed to be a “swift and thorough” investigation. “This is how (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is trying to get away with his war in Ukraine.... It’s a direct attack on the very fabric of our democracy,” said Terry Reintke, one of the lead candidates for the Greens in the European elections in June. “The politicians who have received money from Russia should be severely punished, both politically and legally,” she added in a statement. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine’s Kaniv and Dnister hydropower plants had been attacked in overnight Russian strikes. “The terrorist country wants to repeat the environmental disaster in the Kherson region. But now not only Ukraine, but also Moldova is under threat,” Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. One person was killed and two were injured in the Russian city of Belgorod as a result of a Ukrainian drone attack, Belgorod Region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Friday. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said he held “sincere” talks with his counterpart in India and “agreed to restore the level of cooperation between our countries that existed prior to the full-scale war launched by Russia.” In New Delhi, I had sincere and comprehensive talks with @DrSJaishankar about Ukrainian-Indian bilateral relations, the situation in our regions, and global security.

Ukraine is reliant on financial aid from its Western partners but foreign financing dwindled in the first two months of this year, and a U.S. aid package has been blocked by Republicans in Congress for months. The new block of World Bank aid was funded by Britain and Japan, Shmyhal said. “984 million dollars come from Japan and 516 million dollars from the UK.

Since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has gone out of its way to parade a renaissance of its relationship - including military ties - with Pyongyang. Washington says North Korea has supplied Russia with missiles that it is using against Ukraine, assertions which have been dismissed by the Kremlin and Pygonyang. For Putin, who says Russia is locked in an existential battle with the west over Ukraine, courting Kim allows him to needle Washington and its Asian allies while securing a deep supply of artillery for the Ukraine war. Ukraine claims to have shot down 84 aerial targets during the Russian drone and missile offensive.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in December that his military had proposed mobilising up to 500,000 more Ukrainians into the armed forces as Russia stepped up attacks along the 1,000-km (621-mile) front line. Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, who was appointed last month, said in an interview with Ukrainian media published on Friday that the figure had been “significantly reduced” after a review of resources. He did not name a new figure. “We expect that we will have enough people capable of defending their motherland,” he told the Ukrinform news agency. “I am talking not only about the mobilized but also about volunteer fighters.” Despite the war, the Ukrainian government continues to spend money on the Vernadsky base, an Antarctic research station. Some Ukrainians believe government funds would be better spent on the war in Ukraine. But its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appreciates that the Vernadsky base reminds the world that Ukraine is a global player in science, which contributes to our understanding of the climate crisis, and not just a victim of Russia’s invasion.

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said in a statement that energy facilities in six Ukrainian regions had been attacked in Russian missile and drone attacks. The barrage hit thermal and hydro power plants in central and western Ukraine, power grid operator Ukrenergo said on Friday. Shmyhal said Ukraine needs more air defence systems to secure critical infrastructure and protect the population. Ukrainian state-run Naftogaz oil and gas firm also said its facilities had come under attack on Friday morning. “(Russian attacks) targeted Naftogaz Group’s facilities, but there was no serious damage,” it said in a statement, giving no more details. Russian missile and drone attacks overnight damaged Ukrainian thermal and hydro power plants, electricity grid operator Ukrenergo said on Friday. There were emergency shutdowns in the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. The Dnipropetrovsk governor, Serhii Lysak, said “critical infrastructure” was bombed and a man taken to hospital. Explosions were heard in Ukraine’s Ivano-Frankivsk and Khmelnytskyi regions and the city of Dnipro after Russian cruise missiles were spotted, national media outlet Suspilne reported. Poland scrambled planes as Ukraine came under missile attack on Friday morning, the Polish defence force said. The operational command said Polish and allied aircraft were activated due to “intense activity of long-range aviation of the Russian Federation” related to missile strikes against targets in Ukraine. A Russian SU-35 Flanker fighter jet has crashed into the sea off Sevastopol, Crimea. Footage online showed a jet on fire, spiralling into the ocean and exploding. The Russian-installed governor of the illegally occupied region, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Thursday the pilot ejected and was picked up by rescuers but gave no details as to the cause of the crash. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, told the speaker of the US House of Representatives during a phone call on Thursday that it was vital for Congress to pass a new military aid package for Ukraine. Mike Johnson, the speaker, has held up a bill for months that would supply $60bn in military and financial aid.“We recognise that there are differing views in the House of Representatives on how to proceed, but the key is to keep the issue of aid to Ukraine as a unifying factor,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said he briefed Johnson about the situation on the battlefield and also spoke about “the dramatic increase in Russia’s air terror”. The Ukrainian military later said that its top commander, Oleksander Syrskyi, spoke to the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Charles Brown, about battlefield issues. Zelenskiy, in a CBS interview, has warned that Vladimir Putin will push Russia’s war “very quickly” on to Nato soil unless he is stopped in Ukraine. Zelenskiy acknowledged that his troops are not prepared to defend against another imminent major Russian offensive, and highlighted the urgency for American Patriot missile defence systems and more artillery. The US is telling American companies making and selling parts that can be used in missiles and drones to stop shipping their goods to more than 600 foreign parties who might divert them to Russia. The parts have been found in Russian munitions recovered in Ukraine. A Russian court on Thursday sentenced journalist Mikhail Feldman to two years in prison for denouncing Moscow’s full-scale military offensive on Ukraine.

A nimble New York grocery store follows Latino immigration to the south,"Iván Almonte has been in the US for almost 25 years years, but he still takes photos of the perfect produce – bouquets of epazote, mountains of chiles and perfectly ripe tunas from the prickly pear cactus – in his favorite Durham, North Carolina, grocery store. The 45-year-old remembers when those items were hard to find in this bustling New South city, when he first arrived in 1999 from California after emigrating from Michoacán, Mexico. “It used to be such a challenge when I first came to North Carolina,” Almonte said. “Every Friday or Saturday, we would have to drive 30 or 40 minutes to a carnicería in Burlington or Greensboro to get our ingredients. This went on for maybe 10 or 15 years before we started to see grocery stores that serve our communities. Compare Foods changed everything for us.” He was referring to the grocery store that serves as a community hub for many newly arrived immigrants to the US south. The expansion of this New York City-based chain into smaller markets across the region signals the changing demographics of the south-east, which once had relatively low numbers of foreign-born residents. But that started changing in the 1990s, when North Carolina, specifically, led the nation in the growth of its Latino population; between the 1990 and 2000 censuses, that demographic jumped almost 400%. And according to Census Bureau projections, more than one in four Americans will be Latino by 2060, with Latino buying power having tripled. This shift – in which many immigrants were recruited by agricultural operations or otherwise left traditional destinations in the west and south-west for other points in the sun belt – inspired Compare Foods and its parent company, Aurora Grocery Group, to similarly relocate southward from New York. A family business, Compare Foods started after Eligio Peña came to New York City from the Dominican Republic in 1970. A bodega job eventually led him to purchase his own corner store with his brothers, effectively serving as the family’s entry point into the business. In 1989, Eligio’s brother, Manuel, opened the first Compare Foods in Freeport, New York. The chain now has dozens of locations across the east coast and the south-east, many of which are run by family members – descendants of Eligio, Manuel and their 13 siblings who also helped launch the business. North Carolina’s first Compare Foods opened in Zebulon, a small town outside Raleigh, in 2003. In the years since, the state has become central to the grocery store’s operations. Omar Jorge Peña, the CEO of Aurora Grocery Group’s Compare Foods business in North Carolina, said there were multiple reasons for the company’s moves in the south. First, the surging Latino population ensured a large pool of potential customers. Then, the departure of grocery retailers like Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo opened up available real-estate locations. And North Carolina particularly is in a prime location, close to priority future markets as the company plans to expand “northwards towards Washington DC, southwards towards Atlanta, or westward towards Nashville”. That it’s taken a few decades for a grocery chain like Compare Foods to find its foothold in the south isn’t entirely a surprise. In her book Making the Latino South: A History of Racial Formation, Dr Cecilia Márquez, Duke University assistant professor, traces the growth of Latino populations in places like North Carolina and Georgia. “On the one hand, we’ve been in the south for decades,” Márquez said. “On the other, if you think about it historically, it’s only been a relatively short amount of time. And it takes a long time to build infrastructure for communities.” Between 2010 and 2022, North Carolina saw another 45% growth in the state’s Latino population, according to Carolina Demography, the applied demography unit of the Carolina Population Center at UNC-Chapel Hill. The organization’s executive director, Nathan Dollar, said understanding demographic change is essential so that communities are best served and that demographic change is related to “just about everything” – including grocery stores. What sets Compare Foods apart from competitors large and small is that its selection is tied to the tastes – and composition – of the places where the stores are located. Depending on where you are shopping – whether it’s in Baltimore or one of its Charlotte locations – that location might cater more to Caribbean communities or to those from Central America. Omar Jorge Peña says this is by design because the chain is structured to respond to local communities. Each store is individually owned and operated, usually by a member of the Peña family, though there are also independent operators trained in Compare Foods’ systems. “We can respond to changing demographics much more quickly than our competitors because we’re not being dictated from the corporate office down,” the CEO said. “When the store owner or manager realizes that the demographics in the store neighborhood have changed from Ecuadorian to Honduran, they can make the decision to update the merchandising and product selection in that store to match those changes. It’s part of the beauty of our system that we can adapt quickly to what’s happening around us.” North Carolina isn’t the only state where you can track Latino migration through the proliferation of markets that serve newly arrived immigrants. In the 1990s, California saw a boom of Mexican markets like Northgate González, due to one of the largest arrivals of migrants to the US. Immigrants from the Korean peninsula represent the 10th largest immigrant population in the United States, and the origin story and evolution of the beloved Korean-American grocery store chain H Mart is broadly similar to that of Compare’s. The store’s founder, Il Yeon Kwon, left South Korea in the late 1970s and opened the first H Mart in Queens, New York, in 1982. So-called “ethnic markets” that primarily offer foreign products are estimated to be worth $46.1bn and they are a growing percentage of the US grocery industry. But it’s unclear if small, immigrant-run tiendas and carnicerías are counted as part of this larger market landscape. Even in deeply rural areas across the south, before the advent of larger supermarkets like Compare, these small businesses have offered a place to find familiar ingredients and for newly arrived immigrants to send remittances to family back home. The Guatemalan cookbook author Sandra Gutierrez recalls what it was like to live in North Carolina before “the new southern-Latino movement”. Gutierrez coined the term in her 2011 cookbook The New Southern-Latino Table. Back in 1985 when she first moved to the south, Gutierrez said she could only find cilantro in Asian stores sold as “Chinese parsley”, and she had to special-order black beans. She made do with substituting similar ingredients. Gutierrez transformed grits into masa for tamales. Now, Gutierrez says she can go to Compare Foods and find products from Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Brazil and just about every other Latin American country. The ingredients are easy to find because the grocery store’s aisles are often broken down according to country, speaking to Latino immigration that’s not just larger but increasingly more diverse. “Before Compare was here, little mom-and-pop tiendas owned by Mexican and Central American families helped feed us,” Gutierrez said. “Now that Compare is here, we can find food from all over Latin America. It’s a phenomenal way to shop, and the south is a wonderful place to be right now” due to culinary cross-pollination. In the 1990s, when Gutierrez joined the Cary News to pen a weekly southern food column, making her the first Latin American food columnist in the country, she quickly realized that the southern-Latino crossover happening in her home kitchen was occurring region wide. Readers wrote in to ask about chipotle mayonnaise and a friend’s “southern dinner” included potato salad, deviled eggs and a roasted cabrito served with tostones. This is why when she wrote The New Southern Latino Table, she didn’t focus on a state like Texas. When immigration to North Carolina rose in the 1990s, it wasn’t just immigrants from Mexico who settled in the area; it was Central American laborers, refugees from Venezuela and Cuba and Colombian students. Gutierrez added: “It really is something incredible to live during a period of time in a particular place where you can actually see a movement being born, being adopted and being accepted to such a point that entire grocery stores and entire food industries are coming out of it. In our modern days, I don’t think there’s anywhere else in the world outside of the south where we have been able to see it from the moment it was born and to see how it’s growing and how it’s being transformed.”",2024-03-29T12:00:41Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/mar/29/new-york-grocery-store-latino-immigration,The Guardian
Rust to riches? Ohio city’s fortunes set to rise with flying taxi startup,"For a decade, Dayton in south-west Ohio has fought to shed its rust belt past. New apartment blocks, hotels and breweries have cut into a landscape dominated by derelict warehouses and general industrial decline. But today, that transformation is shifting gears and taking to the skies. A town that 120 years ago produced the pioneers of human flight the Wright brothers is set to build hundreds of futuristic flying taxis each year. It’s here in Dayton – rather than in its home state of California – that Joby Aviation is planning to manufacture its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Joby’s Didier Papadopoulos cites a couple of reasons for the company’s plans to employ up to 2,000 people at a $500m facility north of Dayton scheduled to open next year. For one, it “has a tremendous history in aviation – it’s the birthplace of flight”, Papadopoulos said recently. Also, he remarked, “Ohio is home to a talented and skilled manufacturing workforce, and we expect to hire and train a mixture of both local and national applicants.” The aircraft, slated to appear at the Olympics in Paris this summer, are expected by some to reshape not just air travel but the wider mobility industry. A host of startups and established companies have dived into electric flying vehicles in recent years, and the global eVTOL market is expected to be worth $1tn by 2040. Joby has positioned itself as the “Uber of the skies”. Its aircraft have space for a pilot and four passengers and can reach speeds up to 200mph (322km/h); in November it held a test flight in lower Manhattan and the company says it can reach JFK international airport from Manhattan in just seven minutes compared with the hour it can take by taxi or subway. The company hopes to launch commercial flights in New York City and Los Angeles in 2025 and has signed a home-to-airport taxi service with Delta Air Lines. With the Joe Biden White House committing billions of dollars to a new era of manufacturing, part of a wider move to reduce the US’s dependency on other countries for key technological products, much of that money is landing in the industrial midwest. Millions of dollars of government incentives have been committed to new semiconductor and other mobility projects in Ohio, Michigan and other states that are often more commonly associated with socio-economic decline. For Dayton, a city that has lost close to half its population since the 1960s, the move could spark a major turnaround. “Ohio was the first state to put together an advanced air mobility plan,” said a Joby liaison, Ted Angel, of the Dayton Development Coalition. “No other state had been leaning that far forward.” Several miles east of Dayton, the Wright-Patterson air force base is the largest single-site employer in Ohio and boasts huge federal military research and development spending power that has, in turn, attracted a growing ecosystem of aviation and aerospace partners and startups to the area. In nearby Springfield, a city of 60,000 people that has also suffered through years of manufacturing closures, the US air force has been helping build a new National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence, which is expected to serve as a working home for aviation companies from South Korea and elsewhere. “For a product like the one [Joby] is producing, there is both a defense and security market, and a consumer market,” said the Ohio State University’s Jennifer Clark, an expert in regional planning. “That’s pretty normal for the aviation sector. Almost every aviation company you can think of has both defense and civilian manufacturing. The Dayton area is very familiar with that.” While the creation of thousands of new skilled jobs in economically challenged regions such as Dayton has broadly been welcomed, some in those communities are likely to bear a cost. Known for years as a place with ample affordable housing, Dayton’s rising rental prices last year prompted residents to form a tenants’ union. In other cities, large manufacturing plants have fueled large property price increases. Ohio’s state government is expected to deploy up to $325m in taxpayers’ dollars to help Joby build its facilities. Dayton’s Montgomery county has also proposed giving $1m to the company to help it with “development costs”. “There is a school of thought among economic development people that it is not the best use of taxpayer money to do these recruitment-retention-expansion deals with individual firms because it is risky,” Clark said. “Most of the research indicates that if you want to do sustainable economic development, you want to invest in your institutional infrastructure overall. But that’s the long game.” And while Joby’s initial announcement suggested that 2,000 jobs would be created, that number is now expected to be closer to 1,200, with the potential to rise. Still, for a region whose population has declined for decades, investment from companies at the cutting edge of mobility is seen as a welcome shot in the arm. The fact that the new plant sits atop a former US post office airmail facility is evidence of that. Angel of the Dayton Development Coalition said a host of community colleges and universities around the region have adjusted by opening training programs to establish a pipeline of technicians for Joby and other aviation firms. “I couldn’t count how many tours with schoolchildren we have done,” he said. “The [new] revolution of flight is happening right here.”",2024-03-29T11:00:37Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/29/flying-taxi-joby-aviation-ohio,The Guardian
Russia-Ukraine war: White House says US passed written warning of Moscow attack to Russia – as it happened,"The White House on Thursday described Russia’s allegation that Ukraine was involved in the attack on the Crocus city concert hall as “nonsense”, saying it was clear that Islamic State was “solely responsible”. According to Reuters, in a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow. Here’s a recap of today’s latest developments: Russian investigators claimed on Thursday they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow last week were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”. While it described the nature of the alleged evidence, it did not publish it. In a statement, the state investigative committee claimed the attackers had received significant amounts of cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine, and that another suspect involved in terrorist financing had been detained.

In a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow. Russia vetoed on Thursday the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme. The move comes amid US-led accusations that North Korea has transferred weapons to Russia, which Moscow has used in its war in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the accusations. The White House called Russia’s veto of the renewal of North Korea sanctions monitors a “reckless action” that “further undermines” the UN security council’s actions on North Korea. South Korea’s UN ambassador Joonkook Hwang said the veto was “almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed”, while the deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told the council that Moscow had “undermined the prospect of the peaceful, diplomatic resolution of one of the world’s most dangerous nuclear proliferation issues”. Russia has no designs on any Nato country and will not attack Poland, the Baltic states or the Czech Republic but if the west supplies F-16 fighters to Ukraine then they will be shot down by Russian forces, president Vladimir Putin said late on Wednesday. “The idea that we will attack some other country – Poland, the Baltic States, and the Czechs are also being scared – is complete nonsense. It’s just drivel,” Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript released on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has warned that Vladimir Putin will push Russia’s war “very quickly” on to Nato soil unless he is stopped in Ukraine. In an interview with CBS, Zelenskiy acknowledged that his troops are not prepared to defend against another imminent major Russian offensive, and highlighted the urgency for American Patriot missile defense systems and more artillery. Poland’s prime minister on Thursday hosted his Ukrainian counterpart for long-awaited talks designed to ease friction over Ukrainian farm imports and border blockades by disgruntled Polish farmers. On Thursday, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk welcomed his counterpart Denys Shmyhal to Warsaw. Putin’s foreign intelligence chief paid a visit to North Korea this week to deepen bilateral cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang and discuss broader regional security, Russia’s spy service said on Thursday. Sergei Naryshkin, the head the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, visited Pyongyang on 25-27 March, the SVR said. North Korea’s KCNA state media first reported the visit, said Reuters. The Kremlin gave no indication on Thursday that Russian president Vladimir Putin plans to visit family members of those killed in last Friday’s attack on a Moscow concert hall, which killed 143 people. “If any contacts are necessary, we will inform you accordingly,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, when asked if Putin planned to meet family members of the dead. Security measures in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv will be tightened after a spate of Russian ballistic missile attacks and threats of escalation, a city official said on Thursday. Russia staged concerted airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy system last week in what Moscow said was part of a series of “revenge” strikes in response to Kyiv’s bombardment of Russian regions. Russia struck the north-eastern city of Kharkiv with aerial bombs on Wednesday for the first time since 2022, killing at least one civilian and wounding 16 others, local officials said. The airstrikes caused widespread damage, hitting several residential buildings and damaging the city’s institute for emergency surgery. Authorities in the Mykolaiv region, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, said 12 people were injured and six residential buildings were damaged in a Russian strike on the city on Wednesday afternoon with a ballistic missile. In an overnight attack on the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, Shahed drones struck a residential area, injuring two women aged 72 and 74, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Rescue services said seven buildings were damaged. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has appointed Oleh Ivashchenko as the new head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. A Russian military aircraft crashed into the sea on Thursday off the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the Russian-installed governor of the region, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said. The pilot safely ejected and was picked up by rescuers, he added. The Kremlin said on Thursday complete silence was needed when it came to discussions about possible prisoner exchanges involving Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter arrested in Russia a year ago on suspicion of espionage. Gershkovich, 32, became the first US journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the cold war when he was detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on 29 March. The reporter, the Wall Street Journal and the US government all deny he is a spy. Ukraine asked western allies for additional air defences in an extraordinary meeting of the Nato-Ukraine Council that took place at ambassadors’ level on Thursday. Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian defence minister, briefed the ambassadors and “called on Nato member states to provide additional air defence systems and missiles to protect Ukrainian cities and citizens”. Ukraine’s foreign minister arrived in New Delhi on Thursday for a two-day visit to boost bilateral ties and cooperation with India, which considers Russia a time-tested ally from the cold war-era. Poland’s Internal Security Agency (ABW) has carried out searches as part of an investigation with other European security services into alleged Russian espionage, the agency said on Thursday. French authorities uncovered a website containing a fake recruitment drive for French volunteers to join the war in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Thursday. The site has now been taken down by French services, a government source, who asked not to be named, told AFP without giving further details on the nature of the operation. The Moscow attacks appear to have been the work of the group’s branch in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). ISKP, which was founded in 2015, has targeted propaganda and outreach to central Asia and previously has made multiple efforts to launch recruits into Europe and Russia. Turkey has also been a focus of activity. The four suspects presented in court by Russia were from Tajikistan. Islamic State (IS) remains defeated in its core strongholds of the Middle East but has made significant progress in Africa and parts of south Asia, winning territory and resources that could serve as a launchpad for a new campaign of extremist violence, analysts and officials believe. European governments have moved to their highest levels of alert for years after the attack on a concert hall in Moscow last week by militants from IS that killed 140 people. The attack in Moscow, the most lethal Islamist extremist operation ever in Europe, was claimed by IS, which, officials believe, has been planning new operations against European targets for several years. Between 2015 and 2019, when IS ran a so-called caliphate across a swath of land it controlled in eastern Syria and western Iraq, the group’s central leadership had little need of its newly established affiliates to launch operations in Europe, as it had all resources to hand with foreign recruits, money and training camps. This led to a series of lethal attacks in France and Belgium. However, years of counterterrorism operations by local security forces, the US and others, have degraded IS in its former strongholds, and the group is fragmented and weak. Western security officials with close knowledge of IS in Iraq and Syria said the group had abandoned its project of rebuilding the so-called caliphate but that successful strikes against international targets were seen as “good for morale and the IS brand and compensate for failure closer to home”. Here’s more from the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, who has dismissed as “nonsense” Russia’s allegations of Ukraine’s involvement in last week’s attack on Moscow’s Crocus City concert hall. In a briefing to reporters on Thursday, Kirby said the US passed to Russian security services a written warning of an extremist attack on large gatherings in Moscow, one of many provided in advance. Kirby said: It is abundantly clear that Isis (Islamic State) was solely responsible for the horrific attack in Moscow last week. In fact, the United States tried to help prevent this terrorist attack and the Kremlin knows this. He was speaking shortly after Russian investigators claimed they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in last week’s attacks were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”. Kirby described the Russian allegations as “nonsense and propaganda”, adding that the US had provided multiple advance warnings to Russian authorities of extremist attacks on concerts and large gatherings in Moscow. The US passed, “following normal procedures and through established channels that have been employed many times previously ... a warning in writing to Russian security services”, he added. At least five independent journalists in Moscow have been detained by police over the past 24 hours, according to OVD-Info, a leading Russian human rights organisation. SOTAvision journalist Antonina Favorskaya was taken for interrogation late Wednesday after serving 10 days’ jail for laying flowers at late opposition politician Alexei Navalny’s grave, AFP reported. Her colleagues, Alexandra Astakhova and Anastasia Musatova, who came to meet her at the detention centre where she was set to be released, were also detained by police, SOTAVision said. SOTAvision reporter Ekaterina Anikievich and Konstantin Zharov from RusNews were arrested by police early on Thursday while filming near Favorskaya’s home, it said. Zharov told RusNews that he was beaten while in custody: They kicked me, put a foot on my head, twisted my fingers, mocked me when I tried to get up, demanded to show my rucksack as if it might contain explosives. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he has spoken with the US speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, in which he urged him to hold a vote approving US military aid for Ukraine. Posting to social media, the Ukrainian president wrote: Quick passage of US aid to Ukraine by Congress is vital. We recognize that there are differing views in the House of Representatives on how to proceed, but the key is to keep the issue of aid to Ukraine as a unifying factor. I spoke with @SpeakerJohnson and thanked him personally, both parties, the American people, and President Biden for their critical support of Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.I briefed Speaker Johnson on the battlefield situation, specifically the… The US announced a new package of weapons and equipment to Ukraine earlier this month, as the bill to fund military aid has stalled in Congress amid Republican opposition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has warned that Vladimir Putin will push Russia’s war “very quickly” on to Nato soil unless he is stopped in Ukraine. In an interview with CBS published today, Zelenskiy acknowledged that his troops are not prepared to defend against another imminent major Russian offensive. “We need help now,” the Ukrainian leader said, highlighting the urgency for American Patriot missile defense systems and more artillery. Zelenskiy warned that if Ukraine does lose, Putin will not stop there. He said: At the moment, it’s us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany … This aggression, and Putin’s army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they’re the Nato members. He added that Ukraine is grateful for US support “but the United States don’t have the war going on … but it can come to Europe, and to the United States of America. It can come very quickly to Europe.” It has gone 6pm in Kyiv and 7pm in Moscow. Here is a recap of today’s latest developments: Russian investigators claimed on Thursday they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow last week were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”. While it described the nature of the alleged evidence, it did not publish it. In a statement, the state investigative committee claimed the attackers had received significant amounts of cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine, and that another suspect involved in terrorist financing had been detained.

The site has been taken down by French services, a government source, who asked not to be named, told AFP without giving further details on the nature of the operation. Reuters have more detail on the Russian military aircraft that crashed into the sea off of Sevastopol (see 15:35 GMT) According to Reuters, the Russian military aircraft crashed into the sea on Thursday off the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the Russian-installed governor of the region said. The pilot safely ejected and was picked up by rescuers, Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said. Earlier, Russian Telegram channels reported that a Russian Su-35 fighter jet had crashed near Sevastopol. It was not clear what caused the incident. Russian investigators claimed on Thursday they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow last week were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”, reports Reuters. Russia has said from the outset that it is pursuing a Ukrainian link to the attack, even though Kyiv has denied it and the militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility. According to Reuters, in a statement, the state investigative committee said for the first time that it had uncovered evidence of a Ukrainian link. While it described the nature of the alleged evidence, it did not publish it. “As a result of working with detained terrorists, studying the technical devices seized from them, and analysing information about financial transactions, evidence was obtained of their connection with Ukrainian nationalists,” the statement said. It claimed the attackers had received significant amounts of cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine, and that another suspect involved in terrorist financing had been detained. Eleven people were arrested in the first 24 hours after last Friday’s attack and eight of these, including the four suspected gunmen, have been placed in pre-trial detention. Seven are from Tajikistan and the other from Kyrgyzstan. The US had publicly warned before the concert shooting that it had received intelligence of a possible attack by extremists in Russia. US officials say they believe it was Islamic State Khorasan, the network’s Afghan branch, that was responsible. Russia says it is suspicious that the US was able to name the alleged perpetrator of the attack so soon after it took place. The head of Russia’s FSB Security Service said earlier this week, again without providing evidence, that he believed Ukraine, along with the US and the UK, were involved. Western security analysts have said that the attack raised questions about the resourcing and priorities of Russian intelligence agencies that have been heavily focused on the Ukraine war and the need to stamp out opposition to it within Russia. Reuters have a breaking news line on a Russian military plane which has crashed in the sea near Sevastopol, according to a local governor. More deatails soon … The White House on Thursday described Russia’s allegation that Ukraine was involved in the attack on the Crocus city concert hall as “nonsense”, saying it was clear that Islamic State was “solely responsible”. According to Reuters, in a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow.

According to Reuters, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia questioned the experts’ work, telling the security council before the vote: “Its work is increasingly being reduced to playing into the hands of western approaches, reprinting biased information and analysing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos.” North Korea has been under UN sanctions for its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes since 2006 and those measures have been strengthened over the years. The panel of independent experts has monitored those UN sanctions for the past 15 years, reporting twice a year to the security council and recommending action for improved implementation of the measures. The mandate for the current panel of experts will expire on 30 April 2024. The panel’s most recent report was made public earlier this month and said it was investigating dozens of suspected cyber-attacks by North Korea that raked in $3bn to help it further develop its nuclear weapons programme. “The panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,” said the UK’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward. “But let me be clear to Russia – the sanctions regime remains in place and the UK remains committed to holding DPRK to account for its compliance.” For the past several years the UN security council has been divided over how to deal with Pyongyang. Russia and China, veto powers along with the US, the UK and France, have said more sanctions will not help and want such measures to be eased. China and Russia say joint military drills by the US and South Korea provoke Pyongyang, while Washington accuses Beijing and Moscow of emboldening North Korea by shielding it from more sanctions. Reuters has a couple of breaking news lines on the wires about Russia’s investigative committee saying it has obtained evidence of links between the Crocus city concert hall attackers and Ukraine. Reuters are citing the Russian state news agency RIA. According to the RIA report, as shared by Reuters, Russian investigators said another suspect involved in “terrorist financing” has been detained. More details soon … Russia vetoed on Thursday the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme, reports Reuters. The move comes amid US-led accusations that North Korea has transferred weapons to Russia, which Moscow has used in its war in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the accusations, but vowed last year to deepen military relations. China abstained from the vote on Thursday, while the remaining 13 council members voted in favor. Authorities in the Mykolaiv region, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, said 12 people were injured and six residential buildings were damaged in a Russian strike on the city on Wednesday afternoon with a ballistic missile, according to the Associated Press (AP).In an overnight attack on the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, Shahed drones struck a residential area, injuring two women aged 72 and 74, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Rescue services said seven buildings were damaged.The Black Sea city of Odesa repelled three missile and drone attacks, officials said. A duty that the EU plans to impose on Russian wheat supplies will hit the European market, Sergei Dankvert, head of Russian agriculture watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor, was quoted as saying by state-owned news agency Tass. The imposition of duties could lead to a loss of grain handling capacity, while Russia would be able to divert to other markets the 2.5-3m metric tons of grain it had been shipping to the EU, Dankvert said, according to Reuters. French authorities have uncovered a website containing a fake recruitment drive for French volunteers to join the war in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The site has now been taken down by French services, a government source, who asked not to be named, told AFP without giving further details on the nature of the operation. The site, which is now inaccessible, said 200,000 French people were invited to “enlist in Ukraine”, with immigrants given priority. A link to the site – that resembled the French army’s genuine recruitment portal – had been posted on X, the French defence ministry said. “The site is a fake government site,” the ministry said, also on X, “and has been reposted by malevolent accounts as part of a disinformation campaign”. According to AFP, the ministry did not name any suspects in the website spoof, but a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the site bore “the hallmarks of a Russian or pro-Russian effort as part of a disinformation campaign claiming that the French army is preparing to send troops to Ukraine”. French president Emmanuel Macron angered the Russian leadership last month by hardening his tone on the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, refusing to rule out sending ground troops and insisting Europe had to do all that was needed for a Russian defeat. Similar recent examples of disinformation posts included pictures of French army convoys wrongly presented as moving towards the Ukrainian border, the official said. The fake website invited potential recruits to contact “unit commander Paul” for information about joining. The defence ministry and government cyber units are investigating, ministry staff told AFP. The French government has recently stepped up efforts to denounce and fight what it says are Russian disinformation and destabilisation campaigns aimed at undermining French public support for Ukraine in its war against Russia.",2024-03-28T17:25:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukraine-destroys-drones-as-putin-rules-out-attacks-on-nato-countries,The Guardian
Michael Gove has ‘zero sympathy’ for ‘arrogant’ Thames Water in funding crisis – as it happened,"Thames Water, the UK’s largest water company, edged closer to being taken over by the government on Thursday after its shareholders balked at the prospect of giving it £500m after the regulator refused to allow it to raise prices as high as they wanted. The refusal to stump up the cash could mean that Thames Water is forced into special administration if it is unable to find new investment before its cash reserves run dry at some point next year. The company’s chief executive, Chris Weston, said it is “a long way off” temporary nationalisation, but did not rule it out. The debacle has raised questions about what Labour’s approach will be if – as generally expected – it wins a general election in the next year. Labour and the Conservative party’s Michael Gove said they do not want taxpayers or bill payers to pay the cost, but neither have so far backed nationalisation either temporarily or permanently.

JJ The owner of the Independent news website has taken over the UK arm of publisher BuzzFeed, in a deal that brings to an end the latter’s volatile time operating on its own in the UK. The Independent will gain BuzzFeed Inc’s UK website, editorial staff and website technology as part of a long-term licensing deal. BuzzFeed burst on to the UK media scene in 2013, and garnered large audiences – particularly among younger readers – with viral articles and “listicles”, before branching out into a respected news operation. However, it struggled to convert its audience numbers into profits. In 2017 it cut back its workforce, before disbanding its BuzzFeed News UK team entirely in 2020. Last year it closed the US news team as well. Under the deal the Independent, which has also faced financial problems that forced the closure of its print newspaper operation, will also take over HuffPost in the UK, food website Tasty, and Seasoned, a brand aimed at black British audiences. The Unison union also wants the government to renationalise Thames Water to prevent jobs from being at risk. It is unclear how many – if any – jobs are under threat. Cuts might be conceivable if the company decided to try to cut costs in the future, but for now it is insisting it is “business as usual”. Donna Rowe-Merriman, Unison’s head of environment, said: It’s clear the business model for Thames Water has failed and the company is unviable. Even Thames Water’s own shareholders refuse to keep it afloat. Yet again, staff are facing an uncertain future with jobs at risk and no hope of much-needed investment. Customers will have to contend with poor water quality and rising bills. This utter chaos is further evidence the government needs to renationalise Thames Water now. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, has responded to Michael Gove’s anger about Thames Water. He said anger is not enough from the government. The Lib Dems have been calling for special administration for Thames Water – a temporary nationalisation – for the last fortnight, arguing that it would keep bills down. Davey told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme (via PA) that the government, and communities minister Michael Gove, need to take action against Thames Water. Davey said: And it’s alright Michael Gove being cross, well where are the Conservatives in this? The Conservatives have failed to tackle this over all their time, and we really need now to get a grip of this. People are fed up of this sewage problem across our country, Thames Water one of the worst examples of it, and they’re looking to the government to take some action. Thames Water must “carry the can” for the company’s management failings and not pass higher bills on to consumers, housing and communities secretary Michael Gove has said. The company – and by extension its shareholders – have taken advantage of customers (who cannot switch provider from the natural monopoly) and have not invested enough he said in broadcast interviews. Via PA, Gove said: I think the leadership of Thames Water has been a disgrace. I think for years now we have seen customers of Thames Water taken advantage of by successive management teams that have been taking out profits and not investing as they should have been. When I was environment secretary I called this out. They haven’t changed their ways. I have zero sympathy for the leadership of Thames Water. In my own constituency I have seen how they have behaved in a high-handed and arrogant way towards the consumers who pay their bills. So the answer is not to hit the consumers, the answer is for the management team to look to their own approach and ask themselves why they are in this difficult situation, and of course the answer is because of serial mismanagement for which they must carry the can. The US economy grew at a faster rate than thought at first in the final three months of 2023, surprising economists who had not expected an upward revision. US GDP grew by 3.4% in the final quarter compared to the same quarter a year earlier, according to the final estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). That was up from the 3.2% measured in the second reading. The BEA said the faster growth was thanks to upward revisions to consumer spending and non-residential fixed investment. Reuters reports that the growth rate is well above what the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would consider as non-inflationary – suggesting that more interest rate hikes could be ahead. The economy is growing above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8% and continues to outperform its global peers despite 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the US central bank since March 2022 to quell inflation. The ship that crashed into a Baltimore bridge, causing its collapse, radioed for help saying that it had lost all power, according to US government officials. Investigators from the US National Transportation Safety Board have started to carry out interviews with crew on the ship during the disaster, which killed several people, including maintenance workers and people driving across the bridge in the early hours. Reuters reported: The pilot was heard calling for tugboat assistance several minutes before the crash, the first indication of distress to harbor officials, followed by a radio report that the ship had lost all power and was approaching the bridge, NTSB officials said at a news briefing on Wednesday night. That account tallies with video of the ship which appears to show all of its lights flicking on and off before the impact. The Sellafield nuclear waste dump is to be prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences, the industry watchdog has said. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said on Thursday that it had notified the state-owned Cumbrian nuclear company that it would be prosecuted under industry security regulations. The prosecution follows the Guardian’s revelations last year of multiple cyber failings at the vast site, part of a year-long investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and an unhealthy workplace culture at Sellafield. You can read the full story here: And you can read the original revelations, from the Guardian’s Anna Isaac and Alex Lawson, here: Most of the pressure on Labour to back a permanent nationalisation of Thames Water, the UK’s largest water company, is coming from the left, both within the party and without. If a Labour government were to take power in a general election, which will take place in the next year, then the pressure on it to address the problems facing the privatised water utilities would mount. Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who plans to stand down at the next election, said that the UK should nationalise all of the privatised water companies in England and Wales. (Water companies in Scotland and Northern Ireland are controlled by the government.) Investors can see the writing on the wall for #ThamesWater. Endless sewage, supply outages and no money to sort it out. It's clear Thames Water cannot run this vital public service - none of these companies can. We need to bring them all into public ownership. @We_OwnIt And Labour Lord Sikka said the government should not give a “bailout” to Thames Water shareholders. Instead, it should let it go bust, then nationalise it, he said. Thames Water shareholders not minded to proceed with promised £3.25bn investment to keep it afloat.Want govt bailout, huge hike in customer bills after extracting billions in dividends.Were dividends legal?Let it go bust, nationalise at low price. https://t.co/r9wFEECVIT The GMB union, which represents many of Thames Water’s workers, has accused the company’s shareholders of “essentially blackmailing” customers and Ofwat. The investors have refused to invest £500m previously promised, because regulator Ofwat wants to enforce conditions that would hit their investments. GMB said that the shareholders should follow through on the investment. Gary Carter, GMB national officer, said:  Thames Water investors are essentially blackmailing customers and Ofwat. Assets and infrastructure are falling apart – instead of putting the money in to fix it, shareholders are refusing to pay a penny unless bills are allowed to rocket. Holding bill payers to ransom for costs after years of underinvestment is completely unacceptable. Shareholders need to think again and invest in Thames and the 8,000 strong workforce who keep the company afloat. The Thames Water investors were approached for comment. Thames Water’s parent company, Kemble Water Finance, has said that it will be unable to repay a debt that comes due in April, underlining the financial difficulties faced by the water company. The parent company has appointed advisers from turnaround consultant Alvarez & Marsal to handle negotiations with lenders and the holders of its debt. Thames Water’s complicated capital structure also means that debt related to subsidiary Thames Water (Kemble) Finance Plc will be affected. The companies (which are controlled by a motley crew of sovereign wealth funds and pension funds) said: Absent an investible proposition for the shareholders to provide new equity, Kemble Water Finance Limited (KWF) considers at the current time that it will not be possible to pay further interest payments and, unless an extension to the maturity of the facility is granted by lenders, it will not be able to refinance or repay a £190m facility which matures on 30 April 2024. In light of the above, KWF and Thames Water (Kemble) Finance Plc intend to approach their lenders and noteholders and request continued support in order to provide a stable platform while they engage with all key stakeholders.",2024-03-28T15:41:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/mar/28/thames-water-crisis-sewage-rivers-funding-uk-recession-gdp-economy-sterling-business-live,The Guardian
MLB 2024 predictions: will the Braves machine outdo the Dodgers’ stars?,"Baseball has always been unfair. It wasn’t “fair” when players were bound to the same teams for their whole careers, and it isn’t “fair” that the Dodgers spend so much more than the Athletics. But I’m more concerned about the many teams that could be spending more but abstain. AK Don’t hate the player or the game. Hate the MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and his Players Union counterpart, Tony Clark: the folks responsible for the Death Star sized loopholes which inspired Shohei Ohtani’s $700m contract. The deal pays the modern-day Babe Ruth just $2m a year until 2033, enabling baseball’s new evil empire to add even more pricey pieces. Unfair? Oh yeah, but it’s not LA’s fault: I’m kicking all the blame to baseball’s upper management. DL The business of baseball is inherently unfair and continues to tarnish a beautiful sport. It is fun to have a villain, though, and the Dodgers took advantage of their resources and attractive market to become just that. While the sheer volume of money the sky will rain on Ohtani for the rest of his life is astonishing, the disparity in spending between rich front offices and also-rans is nothing new. MJ No. Even though the Dodgers agreed to pay two players (Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto) more than $1bn combined over the next 12 years, they don’t have the highest payroll in Major League Baseball this season and aren’t paying the highest competitive balance tax. The Dodgers are doing what the smartest franchises – think Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson – have historically done: make their brand recognizable across the world. The Dodgers are wealthy, but they don’t hoard it like other owners do. It’s not a surprise that they lead MLB in attendance every year. GB The return of Oneil Cruz, the Pittsburgh Pirates’ 6ft 7in shortstop, will be a treat. Cruz missed all but nine games last year after breaking his leg in April. When Cruz is healthy – as he seems to be – nobody hits the ball harder, runs faster, or has a better arm. AK The evolution of the Baltimore Orioles. They’ve added ace Corbin Burnes, and are soon to have new ownership that could invest further in a young flock who surprised with 101 wins in 2023. That said, they sent super-prospect Jackson Holliday down to the minors to start the season, annoying his dad and the fan base. But he’ll be in B’more soon enough, adding even more dynamism to the best team in the AL East. DL Juan Soto and Aaron Judge hitting back-to-back. These two feeding off each other have a chance to be one of the most potent duos in MLB history. The Yankees remain one of baseball’s most reviled teams but it’s going to be hard to look away when these two are up. MJ The Dodgers will be under as much pressure to perform as any team since the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs were trying to end their historic World Series droughts. They may be the first “must-watch” team for devoted and casual baseball fans since the dominant Yankees teams of the late 1990s and early 2000s. GB Wyatt Langford. The No 4 pick in last summer’s draft will start the season in the lineup for the defending World Series winners, the Texas Rangers. He’ll share an outfield with Evan Carter, who shone as a rookie during Texas’ pennant run last year. I love watching athletes who can hit. AK Yoshinobu Yamamoto hasn’t had an ERA over 2.00 since 2020, that is, until opening day in Korea left the Dodgers’ new Japanese ace with a fat 45.00 on his ledger. How Yamamoto copes with the new, larger ball, his new surroundings, Major League bats and big league pressure will make his every start fascinating to watch. DL Evan Carter. The breakout star of the 2023 World Series is quite the intriguing watch headed into his first full season with the Rangers. It will surely come with ebbs and flows but if Carter’s OPS is anywhere near the .917 he carried in the postseason, watch out baseball. MJ Jackson Holliday. He won’t be with the Orioles on Opening Day, but it should not be long until the 20-year-old infielder arrives at Camden Yards. Jackson has already flashed a brilliant combination of power, speed and plate discipline that will add further excitement to one of the best young rosters in baseball. GB Juan Soto in the American League, as he’ll be the best outfielder on a team that also has the great Judge and plays in the New York spotlight. Fernando Tatis Jr in the National League; he took well to right field last year, and he’ll keep raking in the middle of San Diego’s lineup. AK Juan Soto is playing for a new contract and landed in just the right place to showcase his prodigious pop. Yankee Stadium is where left-handed power goes to graze and Soto will feast on its short porch to the tune of 50 plus home runs, earning AL honors. In the NL, Ronald Acuña Jr will be back in the winners circle. Last season included 41 homers, 73 stolen bases and over 200 hits in his epic MVP duel with Mookie Betts. While the Dodgers shortstop has it all, the ceiling keeps on rising for Acuna. DL Juan Soto already was one of the youngest players ever to hit 150 home runs. Now he’ll play half his games at Yankee Stadium, the third-most home run friendly ballpark for lefties. Expect Soto to make any swing adjustments necessary to crush the ball over that infamous short porch – and other parts of the stadium too. In the NL, Bryce Harper looks sharper than ever a year after his return from Tommy John surgery. Provided he stays healthy, his disciplined bat should produce a flashy, undeniable stat line. MJ In the AL, Adley Rutschman, the Orioles’ young catcher is already one of the league’s most disciplined hitters (he tied for third in the AL with 92 walks in 2023) and is an excellent defensive catcher (he was the only catcher in 2023 to start over 100 games and not have a passed ball). In the NL, Ronald Acuña Jr should receive stiff competition from Betts again, but the LA star may struggle to adapt to playing shortstop every day for the first time in his career. GB With the Yankees’ beset by pitching question marks (the result of both the Soto trade and an injury to Gerrit Cole), the Blue Jays can finally get over the hump after three wildcard losses in four years. Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr will hit. AK I’ve already poured my heart out about the Orioles, who, it’s true, do have some pitching holes, even after acquiring Burnes. And can you believe it, the savants over at FanGraphs have them at just 85 wins. How can that be? It would be a stunning regression. Even so, the Yankees, Soto and all, have a massive Cole in their rotation, with Gerritt out until, what? June? July? Next season? B’more are better than the Rays and Jays. They’ll repeat. DL This division is stacked but no team is as loaded as Baltimore. The Orioles are returning most of their starting lineup across the board and added a stud ace in Burnes. And while Holliday is starting the season in the minors, he could easily be called up in a week or two and end the season as Rookie of the Year. MJ The Orioles are built to win close to 100 games in the regular season if the pitching staff can remain healthy. They feature two potential MVP candidates (Rutschman and infielder Gunnar Henderson) and a number of young, powerful hitters that should make them one of the most fearsome offenses in baseball. Baltimore should thrive during an otherwise uncertain time for usually strong teams like the Yankees, Rays and Red Sox. GB Someone has to win the division, so it may as well be the Twins. The lineup lacks a star but has depth, and Pablo López, Joe Ryan, and Bailey Ober are a nice 1-2-3 punch of starting pitching. Plus there’s just not much worthy competition elsewhere in the division. AK Imagine the AL Central was a powerhouse of a division? You’d have to have a pretty good imagination. This is the Twins division and their formula is simple: keep their stars like Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton healthy and pitch a little better than last season. They should squeeze out 90 wins, play a few postseason games and then go golfing. DL The Twins won the division last season with a very lukewarm Correa, at least in the regular season. But this year he steps it up, stays healthy, and powers the division’s most explosive offense. The Twins have impressive depth as well but admittedly this is largely a default pick. MJ This remains the weakest division in baseball and the Twins should return to the playoffs after being knocked out in last year’s American League Division Series. The brightest potential star is third baseman Royce Lewis, a former top overall pick who has battled injuries throughout his brief career, but enjoyed an outstanding finish to the 2023 season that included four grand slams. GB The Rangers are the defending world champions, but this division belongs to the Astros until further notice. Houston’s stalwart veteran bats will be enough to take the division crown for a fourth year in a row, and Yordan Álvarez could be the best hitter in the world. AK The Mariners have some of the best pitchers around, but unfortunately, management wouldn’t give the offense the extra ammunition it needs this offseason to take that step up. The AL West is a tough neighborhood, home to the last two World Series champs, and Seattle isn’t going to fend off Houston and Texas without some additional investment. And that’s a shame, with George Kirby, Luis Castillo and of course, Julio Rodriguez, the core is there. Texas and Houston both have rotation health problems, and who gets healthiest the fastest will dictate the winner. I’m going with the reigning World Series champs, the Rangers, with Jacob deGrom back in August to hammer down the ‘Stros. DL Expect a nailbiter to the finish once again but Houston takes the division thanks to their strong top-to-bottom lineup. The offensive stars have mostly remained, the addition of Josh Hader is a plus, and none of the other AL West retooled enough to usurp the Astros. MJ The Rangers won last year’s World Series, but Houston still have the best team for a 162-game season. The addition of the flamethrowing Hader to an already dominant bullpen will make them exceptionally tough to beat in the late innings. GB The Braves have built a machine, and it should keep churning out division titles. Ronald Acuña Jr is the best baseball player breathing right now, the lineup around him is deep, and nobody has a clearly better pitching duo than Atlanta do in Spencer Strider and Max Fried. AK Clear two-horse race, and one of those horses has a limp. OK, maybe that’s a tad rude to say about a Phillies team that should’ve played World Series baseball last October, but there’s just no way any team in that NL East can compete with Alex Anthopoulos’s machine in Atlanta, at least in the regular season. The Braves have the deepest offense in MLB and while the rotation has some health question marks, Atlanta should win their seventh straight division title. DL Atlanta have arguably the most impressive top to bottom roster in baseball. They have two Cy Young candidates in their rotation, they fortified their bullpen in the offseason, and have some dude named Ronald Acuna Jr. The bigger question is whether the Braves can shake the monkey off their back against the Phillies in the playoffs when/if they meet again. MJ It won’t be easy in a division with the star-studded Phillies and lingering Mets, but the Braves are the only team whose talent is comparable with the Dodgers. Not only did they feature last year’s NL MVP (Acuña), they also had the fourth-place finisher (Matt Olson) and the fourth-place finisher for the NL Cy Young Award (Spencer Strider). GB Nobody has reached out to grab the Central with offseason moves, but the Cubs are best positioned after re-signing center field-first base hybrid Cody Bellinger. The team’s offensive supporting cast of Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki, and Nico Hoerner should be enough to beat the field. AK How many wins will it take to win the NL Central: 84, 85? Who can win? Absolutely anyone can win the most wide open division in baseball, even the lowly Buccos. More realistically, the favorites are the retooled Cubs and the humiliated Cardinals, who need to bounce back from the rarest of season busts in 2023. Chicago brought in Brewers skipper Craig Counsell to prove they were legitimately trying. Re-signing Bellinger while inking pitchers Shōta Imanaga and Héctor Neris also showed their intent. The Cards are old with too many question marks. The Brewers are fading. Cubs win. DL The Brewers and Cardinals will put up a valiant fight but the Cubs will eke out a division title. Don’t expect much more than 90 wins, though. Counsell is skilled at taking teams to the postseason. But will they ultimately be sunk by the lack of a megastar? MJ The Reds have endured a cursed spring that saw them lose a bright prospect to a PED suspension (infielder Noelvi Marte) and top hitter to shoulder surgery (infielder Matt McClain). Still, they feature one of the game’s most electrifying young talents in shortstop Elly De La Cruz (who hit 13 homers and stole 35 bases in just 98 games last year) and a budding star in power-hitting first baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand, who will be an unlikely contender to lead the National League in home runs. GB The Dodgers will win this division, just as surely as there will be good weather, delicious Korean food, and tons of traffic in Los Angeles. There is no need to keep up a false pretense that anybody else has a chance to finish ahead of a team this complete. AK How about being NL champions and having basically no shot at winning the West. That’s life for the Diamondbacks, who shocked the Phillies in the NLCS to make the World Series. The battle for second place also includes the Padres, who dealt Soto and lost Blake Snell, and the Giants, who have Snell in hand, new 3B Matt Chapman, and a rehabbing Robbie Ray. San Francisco spent big: now if they only still had Bruce Bochy in their dugout. And yes: the Dodgers will cruise to yet another division title. DL Easy call or easiest call? Sure, it may not be wise to bet on the level of distraction the Ohtani scandal will bring throughout the season. It matters little when considering wins and losses, though. The Dodgers have five-to-six perennial All-Stars without Ohtani. They’ll be just fine. MJ Freddie Freeman, Betts and Ohtani are three of the very best hitters in all of Major League Baseball. Barring injury, the starting pitching staff will have four star arms by the summertime. This division is excellent, but nobody catches the Dodgers over 162 games. GB Rangers, Orioles, Yankees. AK Astros, Yankees, Blue Jays. DL Mariners, Rangers, Yankees. MJ Rays, Rangers, Blue Jays. GB Phillies, Giants, Brewers. AK Phillies, Giants, Padres. DL Phillies, Padres, Diamondbacks. MJ Padres, Phillies, Mets. GB Astros over Yankees. AK Orioles over Astros. DL Orioles over Yankees. MJ Astros over Orioles. GB Braves over Dodgers. AK Braves over Dodgers. DL Braves over Cubs. DL Dodgers over Braves. GB Braves over Astros. The Dodgers are the best team in baseball, but the Braves will have a more enticing set of starting pitchers for a best-of-seven series (particularly because Ohtani will not be ready to pitch again until 2025). Atlanta’s repertoire will be enough to conquer an elite but inevitably aging Astros team for the second time in four years. AK Braves over Orioles. The Braves, 104 wins in the books last season, were ousted by a good Phillies team, who were beaten by a worse Diamondbacks team. Nothing, it seems, can stop baseball’s postseason crapshoot carousel from spinning undeserving teams into places they shouldn’t be. Except this season, Atlanta won’t play the victim, instead, sticking it to LA, making Freddie Freeman wish he never left home. They’ll face a young, cheap and extremely cheerful Orioles team, with a flurry of young stars that will have overperformed two years running, ousting the Yankees in the process. The kids are alright, but nothing like Atlanta and their meticulously built roster, with a pitching rotation bolstered at the deadline. It will be their second title in four seasons. Bravo. DL Orioles over Braves. This time the Braves prevail over their playoff nemesis in Philadelphia to make the World Series. The lineup is just too powerful top-to-bottom. But the Orioles are poised to win it all. Last regular season was no fluke, more a glimpse into the Orioles’ future. The young players gained a valuable year of experience, and an already strong pitching staff got a stud in Burnes. MJ Dodgers over Astros. I am blandly choosing what I believe to be the two most talented teams to win the pennant (and the four most talented teams to reach the championship series) and reverse the trend of the best teams suffering early playoff exits. Los Angeles will likely need to acquire a shortstop and one more starting pitcher at some point during the season, but their biggest foe will be the pressure they’ll meet as soon as October begins. Nothing seems to faze the Astros, who are still enjoying excellent play from reliable stars Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Ultimately, I think the Dodgers edge the Astros by exploiting a starting pitching advantage and avoiding Houston’s devastating bullpen.

Ohtani representatives refuse to give evidence they reported alleged theft,"Unanswered questions remain over allegations Shohei Ohtani’s former interpreter stole millions from the baseball star after his representatives declined to give further details to ESPN. Ippei Mizuhara is accused of wiring huge sums from Ohtani’s accounts to cover his debts with an illegal California bookmaker, a claim the player repeated in a press conference on Monday. Ohtani’s representatives said last week that “we are turning the matter over to the authorities”. However, they have repeatedly declined to say which authorities they have reported the alleged theft to. When ESPN asked for proof of any criminal report on Tuesday, Ohtani’s representatives again declined to comment. The agencies likely to investigate any allegations around Mizuhara did not confirm to ESPN that they had received any report from Ohtani’s representatives. The Department of Homeland Security said it was working with the IRS to look into Mizuhara, but did not say whether that was connected to the alleged theft. It also did not confirm whether it had been contacted by the Ohtani camp. The IRS has previously told ESPN that it is investigating Mizuhara and California bookmaker Mathew Bowyer, but did not say whether it had been contacted by Ohtani’s representatives. Betting is legal in most US states but not in California. Mizuhara initially said Ohtani had given him money to pay off his gambling debts. However, Ohtani’s lawyers then said Ohtani had been a victim of “massive theft” orchestrated by Mizuhara. In a subsequent interview with ESPN, Mizuhara said he had lied in his initial statement and that Ohtani knew nothing about the gambling debts. Mizuhara, who had been a close friend of Ohtani, was fired as his interpreter. “Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has told lies,” Ohtani said on Monday. Mizuhara said last week that Ohtani did not place any bets himself. “I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting,” he said. MLB players face lifetime bans if they bet on their own teams. The story has overshadowed MLB as it prepares for Opening Day on Thursday. Ohtani is baseball’s biggest star, and one of the most famous people in his native Japan. Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal, and MLB expected the storyline of the season to be around one of the most talented baseball players in history joining one of the sport’s most famous clubs. However, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said on Tuesday that he believes Mizuhara’s departure will help Ohtani bond with his new team. “Actually, I would argue that it’s going to help relations internally,” Roberts said. “Because there’s no longer a buffer. I think that I’ve already seen it the last couple of days. I think Shohei has been even more engaging with his teammates, and I think there’s only upside with that.” Roberts added that he was glad Ohtani addressed the media on Monday. “I think [Monday] was a big day, and we’re all looking forward to moving forward,” Roberts said. “But I do think it’s an opportunity for us to really support him from everywhere.” Ohtani has gone 0 for 6 in three exhibition games since returning from the Dodgers’ recent trip to South Korea.",2024-03-27T12:15:37Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/27/shohei-ohtani-ippei-mizuhara-theft-allegations-wire-police-report-baseball,The Guardian
India left reeling by Afghanistan as World Cup hopes begin to fade again,"Perhaps the one positive for India from their shock 2-1 home defeat by Afghanistan in 2026 World Cup qualification is that the team have risen far enough for shock defeats to be a thing. It is not much of a comfort, however, and once solid-looking dreams of reaching the final stages on the road to the World Cup for the first time are starting to hang by delicate threads of Assam silk. On Thursday, fans in that state’s biggest city, Guwahati, were confident of a comfortable win against Afghanistan, a team ranked 158 in the world. The 0-0 draw between the two five days earlier in the south-west corner of Saudi Arabia, rather than in Kabul, was surely a blip. Qatar were streaking ahead in Group A of qualification, leaving India and Kuwait to fight for the second spot that also brings a place in the final 18 that will fight it out for Asia’s increased World Cup allocation of eight. India had four points from the first three games and could have moved four points clear of third with two games to go. That seemed to be on the cards when the third-highest active men’s international goalscorer, Sunil Chhetri, netted No 94 (12 behind Lionel Messi and 34 behind Cristiano Ronaldo) in the first half. With 20 minutes left, however, Rahmat Akbari equalised and just before the end Sharif Mukhammad scored an already famous winner. It was a stunning result. India are still second but instead of being almost home and dry they are level on points with Afghanistan and one ahead of Kuwait and still have Qatar still to play. Anything could happen in the remaining games in June. Fans gathered outside the stadium to boo as the team headed to the bus and chants of “Stimac out” could be heard. Igor Stimac’s job is on the line. The former Derby and West Ham centre-back was already on the defensive after last year’s rumours – angrily denied – that he consulted astrologers when selecting the team and, more importantly, a poor Asian Cup. India arrived at the tournament in January with high hopes but left Qatar without scoring a goal. The Blue Tigers broke into the top 100 of Fifa’s rankings last summer but they have since slipped to 117. The team are reliant on the soon-to-be-40 Chhetri in attack and fans feel their Croatian coach does not take enough responsibility for setbacks. After the loss, Stimac said he did just that, but then talked of a lack of intensity from his players, too many mistakes and a need to improve fitness levels. It is a measure of the progress made that missing out on the last 18 of qualification would be regarded as a major failure but Stimac needs to prove wrong an increasing number of fans who feel he has taken the team as far as he can in the past five years. Afghanistan’s coach, Ashley Westwood, has inserted himself into any conversation if Stimac leaves. The former Sheffield Wednesday defender won two Indian league titles in 2014 and 2016 with Bengaluru, a new team. After leaving for Malaysia to take over underperforming Penang, he probably tried to change too much too quickly and it did not work out. Now, though, he has reminded people what he can do after five months with Afghanistan. It is a challenging job. The Aghanistan national team are not able to play games at home. Much of the squad is made up of players who left the country at a young age to settle in Europe. “We’ve worked really hard over the last 14 days, we’ve had some incredible travel,” said a delighted Westwood, who claimed the Lions of Khorasan should also have won the first meeting between the two. “Players, staff from 16, 17 different countries coming together, it has been difficult. We’ve had 350 flights to organise; it’s a logistical nightmare.” Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Stimac would welcome that problem. He and the federation have asked the India government to allow players of Indian origin who were born and raised in Europe and elsewhere to Indian parents to be granted dual nationality so they can be called up. It has yet to happen. China’s new coach, Branko Ivankovic, another Croatian, called up the naturalised Brazilians Elkeson and Fernandinho for his first two games, both against Singapore. The first was a disaster as Team Dragon, who also failed to score at the Asian Cup, let slip a two-goal lead to draw 2-2. For an hour of the return in Tianjin, it was looking dicey at 1-1 before three late goals provided a vital China win. It prevented more negative headlines on the day Chen Xuyuan, former head of the China Football Association, had been jailed for life on corruption charges. He joins in prison a number of other high-ranking officials as well as the former national team coach, and Everton player, Li Tie. China got out of jail late against Singapore but failure to beat Thailand on 6 June may result in the team needing to get something against their international kryptonite, South Korea, in Seoul. India also can’t afford any more slip-ups.",2024-03-27T12:06:43Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/27/india-world-cup-dream-fading-after-shock-home-defeat-to-afghanistan-2026-asian-qualifiers,The Guardian
Extreme heat summit to urge leaders to act on threat from rising temperatures,"Two of the world’s biggest aid agencies will host an inaugural global summit on extreme heat on Thursday as directors warn that the climate crisis is dramatically increasing the probability of a mass-fatality heat disaster. The conference will highlight some of the pioneering work being done, from tree-planting projects to the development of reflective roof coverings that reduce indoor temperatures. After last year’s record-shattering temperatures, when 3.8 billion people – half the world’s population – sweltered in extreme heat for at least one day, the organisers hope the event will prompt governments to prepare for a “silent killer” that rarely gets the attention it deserves when compared with hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) have come together to stage this virtual conference, in which they will urge national governments, local authorities, humanitarian groups, companies, school and hospitals to develop heat action plans. They will float the idea of naming heatwaves in the same way that typhoons or hurricanes are labelled to make them more prominent. Jagan Chapagain, the IFRC secretary general, drew comparisons to Kim Stanley Robinson’s apocalyptic novel Ministry for the Future, which opens with a deadly heatwave in India that kills millions of people, some of whom are poached alive in a lake they hoped to cool off in. “It is, for now, science fiction,” he said. “We’re not there, yet. But extreme heat, far less visually dramatic than hurricanes or floods, is claiming lives and livelihoods with a stealth which belies its impact. Climate change is dramatically increasing the probability that we will see a mass-fatality extreme heat disaster soon.” Chapagan said heat was already a major cause of suffering in many parts of the world. In the US it accounts for more deaths than all other climate impacts put together, but this often goes unreported because it is usually less sudden, less visual, than events such as hurricanes, and the scale of fatalities can take months or years to calculate. These types of disaster are starting to appear on the IFRC radar. The organisation’s 40-year-old Disaster Response Emergency Fund received its first appeal for a heatwave in 2018, from North Korea. The next came in 2021 from Vietnam, then two the following year (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan), followed by three last year (Greece, Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan). In that period, the amount the fund provided to heatwave appeals rose more than fivefold. While the sums are still relatively small compared with more traditional humanitarian responses for earthquakes and cyclone disasters, heatwave risks are projected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. The death toll from heat-related illnesses is forecast to soar more than fourfold by midcentury if temperatures rise by 2C, according to a recent study in the Lancet. A separate study predicted that China alone is on track to see between 20,000 and 80,000 heatwave deaths a year. One of the primary goals of the heat summit is to improve data collection, which is currently done on a piecemeal basis, often using different standards from country to country. Last year, France estimated it had 5,000 heat-related deaths, Germany 3,000 and the UK 2,295. Yet far more populous countries in Asia reported much lower tolls, despite higher temperatures and lower public investment in healthcare. India registered 179 heat-related deaths, Pakistan 22 and Malaysia and Thailand two each. A higgledy piggledy approach has led to some strange statistical anomalies. According to the World Health Organization, there were 166,000 deaths due to heatwaves between 1998 and 2017, about half of which were in Europe, despite the fact that Europe has less than a tenth of the world population, some of the best healthcare systems and relatively low average temperatures. In reality, there is no doubt that the most heat-vulnerable people live in poorer, hotter countries. Most at risk are the elderly, sick and those who work outside or live in poorly-ventilated homes without air conditioning. This week’s summit aims to draw more attention to their plight and to best practice in disaster alerts and response. In many cases, cities are leading the way. Freetown in Sierra Leone is one of the pioneers. Its mayor, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, who will speak at this week’s summit, has appointed a heat officer to draw up and administer an action plan. This includes heatmapping the city to identify the highest-risk areas, sending out temperature forecasts by WhatsApp groups, the installation of shades over outdoor markets and the creation of 24 “cool corridors” by 2030 through a tree planting campaign. The city is also hosting a pilot programme in the shantytowns where 45% of the population live, coating corrugated iron roofs with a mirrored film that can reflect the sun’s energy away from the building below. Initial tests suggest this can reduce temperatures inside by as much as 6C. This work has not always been easy. The market shades were ripped away in fierce storms and have to be replaced with a more durable material. Funding has also been difficult, but Aki-Sawyerr said residents were happy to have more protection from the heat. “We have to be innovative. Many of these things haven’t been done before,” she said.

Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in other countries are also putting more effort into heatwave preparedness. Before a recent heatwave in Hanoi, volunteers parked mobile “cooling buses” – offering air conditioning, cool water and a shaded place to sit – in areas frequented by street vendors, motorcycle riders and other outdoor workers. In Nepal, where temperatures in the southern lowlands often exceed 45C and humidity can be high, volunteers are encouraging meteorologists to improve early warning systems, municipalities to create “cool shelters” in the hottest areas, and hospitals to prepare for the health impacts during periods of high temperatures. Educational establishments are a particular focus. Last year, authorities in the Terai region, which is usually the hottest in the country, closed schools for several days so children would not have to walk outside during a heatwave. “The youth understand the issues. We are trying to mobilise them and encourage each school and campus to have a heat action plan,” said Sagar Shrestha, the director of disaster management at the Nepal Red Cross Society. Among the speakers at the heat summit will be John Podesta, who was recently appointed as the top US climate diplomat, replacing John Kerry. The meeting will launch an online “extreme heat global action centre” where local leaders and governments can share tips on how to improve the resilience of cities, companies and communities. It will also kick off a two-month global campaign to raise awareness, culminating in a Heat Action Day on 2 June. In future, the IFRC aims to put in place heatwave disaster kits, prevention plans and rapid response guidelines such as those it now has for other disasters. “We are not there yet,” Chapagain said. “We don’t have the standardised response that we have for other crises. This is an area where the humanitarian community hasn’t paid enough attention.” But he expressed confidence that preparedness would improve. Referring back to the horrors described in Ministry for the Future, he said: “Science fiction is deliberately scary. Reality need not be. With the right anticipation and action, the very worst scenarios can remain in the realm of imagination.”",2024-03-27T11:37:19Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/extreme-heat-summit-to-urge-leaders-to-act-on-threat-from-rising-temperatures,The Guardian
Jen didn’t fit the profile for a heart attack – then she had three of them,"At just 36, Jen O’Neill was not considered an emergency department priority for treatment for a suspected heart attack. O’Neill, who had given birth 11 months previously, had none of the traditional precursors for a heart attack – no family history, no high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol levels – but her troponin levels confirmed the problem was in her heart. When she was finally taken for a scan, she received a diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection, which occurs when there is a tear in the artery that supplies blood to the heart. More than nine out of 10 Scad cases are women, often soon after they have a baby. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But with no research into the best course of medication for the condition, O’Neill was given the same course of blood thinners and beta blockers used for more traditional heart attack patients. The blood thinners made her periods extremely heavy and gave her awful fatigue. They were also meant to prevent further heart attacks. But O’Neill went on to suffer another two. “We don’t have kind of a gold standard treatment of Scad … because my understanding is a lot of the research is based on males, because they are the traditional heart attack patients,” O’Neill said. Now, a new national research centre will be dedicated to improving the lack of knowledge about how sex and gender affects the risk, detection and treatment of many health conditions – and translating that research into policies and practice. The Centre for Sex and Gender Equity in Health and Medicine will launch on Wednesday at the University of New South Wales, an initiative of the George Institute for Global Health, the Australian Human Rights Institute at the University of New South Wales, and Deakin University, with support from the Victorian Department of Health and the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. Prof Robyn Norton, the founding director of the George Institute, said: “Our knowledge about health has overwhelmingly come from studies done with male cells, male animals, male humans used as standard in the laboratory, and that’s got to change.” Norton said she and her colleagues had realised Australia was “really quite behind” other countries such as Canada, US, Japan, Korea and many European countries who had established centres focused on trying to understand the role of sex and gender on health equity. The evidence base underpinning healthcare was one of the five domains identified to describe gender bias in healthcare in a report released this month by the National Women’s Health Advisory Council, formed in late 2022 to address medical misogyny and chaired by the assistant minister for health, Ged Kearney. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Through research and advocacy, the new centre will address gender bias in health and medicine that leads to poorer health outcomes, evidence gaps and inefficient health spending for women, intersex people, trans and gender-diverse people, and in some cases also men. For example, the data for osteoporosis – which is viewed predominately as a disease of older women – shows that men are rarely treated for the condition and have a higher mortality rate than women from its complications. “There’s an opportunity we hope with the centre to really look at improving health outcomes and health equity, frankly, for all Australians,” Norton said. The centre will have two hubs – one based at UNSW and another at Deakin. Researchers at both universities will be engaged in studies addressing inequities in health but the centre will also serve as a resource for outside organisations and individuals around the country. Norton said the centre would also focus on the translation of research findings into policy and practice, through working with governments, healthcare providers and the business community.",2024-03-26T22:00:33Z,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/27/jen-didnt-fit-the-profile-for-a-heart-attack-then-she-had-three-of-them,The Guardian
Foreign Office summons senior Chinese diplomat over ‘malicious cyber activity’,"Ministers summoned a senior Chinese diplomat to the Foreign Office on Tuesday after accusing Beijing-backed hackers of a cyber-attack on the British elections watchdog and a surveillance operation on politicians. The department called in China’s chargé d’affaires and told him the UK would not tolerate “threatening” cyber-attacks. An FCDO spokesperson said the ministry had “set out the government’s unequivocal condemnation of Chinese state-affiliated organisations and individuals undertaking malicious cyber activity against UK democratic institutions and parliamentarians”. “The UK government would not tolerate such threatening activity, and would continue to take strong action with partners across the globe to respond,” they said. The summons came after the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, announced sanctions on Monday on a company and two individuals accused of involvement in China’s malicious cyber activity. But ministers faced criticism from Tory MPs including Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, and Alicia Kearns, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who called the government’s actions “feeble” and “insufficient”. Rishi Sunak defended his approach to China, insisting the UK was “undoubtedly more robust than most of our allies”. MPs on the liaison committee challenged him on the government’s reluctance to act on Chinese-owned companies such as ByteDance, which owns TikTok. The prime minister told MPs the UK had introduced stronger export controls for sensitive technologies and a tougher foreign investment scheme than other countries. “On trade, we are already less dependent on China for trade than Australia, Korea, Japan, the US, Germany and many other countries,” he said. “I am entirely confident that our approach to dealing with the risk that China poses is very much in line with our allies and in most cases goes further in protecting ourselves.” Sunak also cited the government’s decision to remove Huawei equipment from the UK’s telecommunications networks, which Boris Johnson took in 2020 after a major rebellion by Tory backbenchers. Dowden indicated on Tuesday that the government was preparing to put China in the enhanced tier of the government’s new foreign influence registration scheme. This would require organisations or individuals to register with the government if they carry out advocacy or campaigning activities on Beijing’s behalf. The prime minister’s spokesperson said the scheme was “in the process of being finalised and no countries have been specified yet”. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dowden told MPs on Monday that ministers were “in the process of collective government agreement” on the matter and that “the conduct that I have described today will have a very strong bearing on the decision that we make in respect of it”. Ministers are also under pressure to formally designate China a threat to UK security in the government’s integrated review, which sets out the country’s foreign, defence and security policies. It currently refers to China as an “epoch-defining challenge”. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, told Times Radio that China was “obviously a security threat”. There are differing views in government about how robust an approach to take against China, which is one of the UK’s biggest trading partners. The sanctions announced on Monday were part of a joint action by the UK and its allies to reveal the scale of Chinese cyber-espionage activities, with the US charging seven alleged Chinese hackers.",2024-03-26T18:06:33Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/26/foreign-office-summons-senior-chinese-diplomat-over-malicious-cyber-activity,The Guardian
Censor those trousers! How Alan Titchmarsh’s legs became TV editors’ latest target,"I wonder how Alan Titchmarsh feels today. On the one hand, footage has surfaced of him on North Korean state television, which has been rebroadcasting episodes of his BBC series Garden Secrets since at least 2022. On the other, the North Korean government seems to hate him. Well, part of him. Not only have the North Koreans hacked down each hour-long episode to just 15 minutes, drowning out his speaking voice with a mixture of voiceover and instrumental music in the process, but they have also shamed his legs. Thanks to a government ruling that decries denim jeans as a sign of evil American imperialism, Titchmarsh’s legs are blurred out whenever they are on screen. The effect is that Titchmarsh appears as a benign hovering wizard. Even this is radical. The website KCNA Watch runs a daily livestream of Korean Central TV. Last Friday’s programming, for instance, was largely devoted to factory tours, sparsely attended football matches and agricultural machinery shows. Compared to output like this, the sight of Titchmarsh gently tending to his borders must come off like that banned Jonathan Glazer advert where the devil sells Flake chocolate. Not that North Korea is the only country that edits foreign media. Two years ago, Manyun Zou, a writer for the website the Pudding, watched 100 episodes of The Big Bang Theory that were broadcast on the Chinese streaming service Youku and noticed that they were riddled with seemingly arbitrary edits. Jokes on the Youku versions were sliced out carelessly, leaving the related canned laughter in place. Meanwhile, there is a Chinese ruling banning TV shows and films that depict time travel, on the basis that it lacks “positive thoughts and meaning” and can “disrespect history”. As such, for a number of years it was impossible to find Doctor Who on Chinese television. Sign up to What's On Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday after newsletter promotion We shouldn’t pretend that such censorship happens only in totalitarian Asian countries. Australia, for instance, has repeatedly banned a particular episode of Peppa Pig. The episode, Mr Skinnylegs, revolves around the young piglets learning that spiders are ultimately harmless visitors in our homes. This is true – if you live in Peppa Pig’s country of origin. If you live in Australia, though, where some spiders can kill you, the episode has a different timbre. Viewed through this lens, Mr Skinnylegs dares children to dice with death. Of course, Britain is no stranger to berserk censorship. As recently as the 1990s, the British government cracked down on anything that could be thought to be peripherally supportive of the IRA, including documentaries and an episode of the US drama Lou Grant. Even more strangely, it banned the voices of Irish republicans and loyalist paramilitaries from being broadcast on television or radio. This led to an absurd workaround where these people could be interviewed, but their voices had to be overdubbed by an actor, lest the sound of Gerry Adams’ speaking voice corrupt our brains. You can imagine that, if Adams had gone on television wearing a particularly Irish-looking pair of trousers, the government would have airbrushed those, too. Maybe the North Koreans aren’t so different after all.  This article was amended on 26 March 2024. An earlier version mistakenly said that John Hume’s voice had been censored. It was further amended on 27 March 2024. An earlier version said that Doctor Who was banned in China; this is no longer the case.",2024-03-26T13:20:54Z,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/26/censor-those-trousers-how-alan-titchmarshs-legs-became-tv-editors-latest-target,The Guardian
Cargo ship that hit Baltimore bridge was involved in Antwerp collision in 2016,"The same vessel that hit the Baltimore Francis Scott Key Bridge on Tuesday, destroying it and sending people and vehicles tumbling into the water, was also involved in a collision while leaving the port of Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016. According to Vessel Finder and the maritime incident archive Shipwrecklog, the Dali – a 948ft (290-meter) cargo ship with a capacity of 10,000 containers – was leaving the container terminal of Antwerp heading to Bremerhaven. As it did so, its bow reportedly swung around, causing the stern to scrape the side of the quay, significantly damaging several meters of the hull. The ship was reportedly detained by authorities afterward and docked in Deurganckdok, Belgium. There were reportedly no injuries or adverse pollution. According to Vessel Finder, the weather was fine at the time, and the incident was reportedly blamed on the ship’s master and pilot on board. A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own. For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes. For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers' Federation. Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account. The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition. Karen McVeigh, senior reporter It is unclear what crew were aboard the ship. Vessel Finder said at the time that the ship, which was built in South Korea in 2015 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, was owned by the Greek company Oceanbulk Maritime but was chartered by Maersk. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) confirmed on Tuesday that the Dali was registered in Singapore and had 22 crew on board, with Maersk adding in a statement that the crew were all Indian but none of them were Maersk crew or personnel. It said the ship was operated by the charter vessel company Synergy Group. Maersk has been approached for comment. About 2.6km (1.6 miles) of the Baltimore bridge collapsed on Tuesday when the Dali crashed into it, causing a number of vehicles to fall into the Patapsco River below. At least seven people were being searched for with two rescued, including one in critical condition, officials said on Tuesday at a pre-dawn press conference.",2024-03-26T12:17:34Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/26/baltimore-bridge-ship-previous-collision-antwerp-2016,The Guardian
Australia 5-0 Lebanon: World Cup 2026 qualifier – as it happened,"Joey Lynch has filed from the GIO Stadium, so it’s time to wrap up tonight’s blog. Thanks for your company and emails, bye! “A clinic in Canberra”. That’s how the Socceroos’ social media account has described tonight’s game. I wouldn’t go quite that far but it was one of the better attacking performances of the last couple of years, with some exciting glimpses of the future. A record crowd of 25,023 should go home sated. 2 min Kusini Yengi scored his first international goal from a magnificent Craig Goodwin cross 47 min Bassel Jradi scored an unfortunate own goal after Harry Souttar’s header was saved 48 min Goodwin waved a superb third from the edge of the area 68 min The debutant Patrick Yazbek made a first international goal for John Iredale, who had just come on 81 min Goodwin tapped in his second after good play from Iredale on the right. The state of play in Group I Australia P4 Pts 12 Palestine P3 Pts 4 Lebanon P4 Pts 2 Bangladesh P3 Pts 1 It’s currenetly goalless between Bangladesh and Palestine after an hour. John Iredale’s reaction It means the world to me personally, and to the boys. We set out to score more goals tonight and we’re pleased we did that. It’s really special when you come from the same youth team [as Patrick Yazbek] to share a goal and assist. As soon as I saw him charging down the left I knew I had to get in the box. Craig Goodwin’s got an unbelievable left foot, and having him in the squad really boosts our quality. I was really pleased to help him get his second goal. A first #Socceroos goal in just his second cap 🇦🇺👊@john_iredale9 ⚽🥅🎥 @10FootballAU #LBNvAUS #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/lkxeIFiNJW “From the snippets I’ve seen that was pretty prosaic...” says Chris Paraskevas. “You can feel Arnie’s grip on the job loosening post Asian Cup. His body language is more tetchy than usual. Something isn’t quite right at the moment, a sense that things have become unsettled.“Fine margins. I really think his tenure will be defined by a 15-minute spell against Korea (and possibly a more positive 15-minute spell against Argentina. As much as this is a PR boost and a ‘good night’ for Football Australia... it’s not enough to start turning the tide of public opinion.” I wonder whether football fans expect more/too much these days, or whether we are just more exposed to complaints. I’ve no idea. But given that watching sport is something we love, we do spent an awful lot of time in a state of dissatisfaction. I don’t say that critically by the way; I’ve been a horribly entitled brat in the past. The Socceroos are into the third round of World Cup qualification with a couple of games to spare. An emphatic win over Lebanon was a celebration of both the present and future. Craig Goodwin flaunted his educated left foot, making the first goal and scoring two – the first a beauty – in the second half. There were also first international goals for Kusini Yengi and John Iredale, as well as assists for Iredale and the debutant Patrick Yazbek. All in all, it was a good night for Graham Arnold.

This one definitely isn’t timewasting. 90 min There will be five added minutes. To what end, we know not. 89 min Look, there’s nothing to report, just a lot of dead time since the fifth goal. 87 min Australia’s record in the second round of qualification now reads P4 W4 D0 L0 F15 A0. Truly, we’ve seen worse. 86 min: Lebanon substitution Jackson Khoury, who was born in New South Wales, comes on for Bassel Jradi. 82 min: Australia substitutions Sammy Silvera and Thomas Deng come on for Mitch Duke and Gethin Jones. The celebration of Craig Goodwin continues with his second goal of the night. Jones played a simple ball down the right to Iredale, who made a nice run into space and crossed low into the middle. Shour, stretching towards his own goal, could only divert the ball across the six-yard box to Goodwin. The rest was a formality. 79 min: Lebanon substitution An unhappy Omar Bugiel is replaced by Hasan Srour. 79 min Here’s that sweet hit from Craig Goodwin that put Australia 3-0 up just after half-time. A @craig_goodwin11 stunner and slick assist 🏹🎥 @10FootballAU#LBNvAUS #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/erzZIrbGF6 78 min Now Bitar curls wide from the edge of the area. The Socceroos have lost a bit of focus in the last few minutes. The crowd at Bruce Stadium is in. A new football record for Canberra at 25,023.Beats the previous record of 24,800 set when it hosted a doubleheader during the Sydney 2000 Olympics. 76 min Ryan makes a comfortable save, his first of the night I think, from Bugiel’s header. 73 min Lebanon know their race is run. What they need now is for Bangladesh to take points off Palestine in the other game; it’s 0-0 at half-time. John Iredale, who only came on 90 seconds ago, has scored his first international goal. The debutant Patrick Yazbek charged down the left, away from a slightly woolly challenge by Khamis, and curled a superb low cross on the run. Iredale sped away from Sharafeddine at the far post and swept the ball into the empty net. How’s that for an instant impact? 66 min: Double substitution for Australia John Iredale and the debutant Josh Nisbet replace Kusini Yengi, who will remember this night for many a decade, and Connor Metcalfe. Khalil Khamis was booked just before that, I think for dissent. Cap number #642 🟢🟡Josh Nisbet is a #Socceroo#LBNvAUS #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/QDPvbD4U4l 64 min Metcalfe plays in the overlapping Jones, whose cross is headed over from eight yards by Duke. It was slightly too high. Just before that, there was an appeal for a penalty when the ball hit Bitar’s hand. It deflected off his chest, though, so it was the correct decision. 62 min It’s been fairly subdued since that third goal, with both sides knowing that the game is over barring a comeback for the books. 60 min “The game will take care of itself,” says Martin Turnbull, “but a bit of a bugbear of mine – Arnold with his hand over the heart during the anthem. Might be getting long in the tooth but despise creeping Americanisms. Teams going on o-fence and d-fence, which is also happening in the footy. Anyway, let’s get five.” I can’t speak for Graham Arnold but I do wonder how often gestures like that are a sad (I use that word in the truest sense, while looking in the mirror) attempt to embrace a modern world that the person doesn’t truly understand. I’m not looking forward to growing old and doddery in a post-empathy world. 59 min: Lebanon substitution What, another one? Yep, Gabriel Bitar for Ali Tniech. 58 min: Substitution for Lebanon Karim Darwich replaces the excellent Hassan Maatouk, who at 36 can’t always do the full 90 minutes. 55 min: Socceroos substitution Patrick Yazbek, a 21-year-old of Lebanese descent, replaces Ajdin Hrustic. Congratulations to Patrick Yazbek who becomes cap number 641 👏#LBNvAUS #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/ZlU9A3LQod 54 min The more replays you see, the more you realise Tniech should have been sent off for that tackle on Hrustic. It was born of frustration rather than malevolence but it was still dangerous. And it has done a lot of damage: Hrustic is being helped off by two physios, moving very gingerly. Waved away but he's being carried off by the trainers, unable to support his own weight on his left leg. #LBNvAUS https://t.co/T5AUkmBCwA 53 min That was a poor challenge, with Tniech’s studs plunging into Hrustic’s calf, and he is still down. Patrick Yazbek is preparing to come on for his Socceroos debut. 51 min Tniech is booked for taking out Hrustic in frustration after losing the ball. 51 min: Matar hits the bar! Crikey, it’s all happening. Nader Matar runs onto a loose ball 25 yards out and hits an instant, almost angry shot that beats Ryan and clatters off the bar. Australia broke four on three, with Hrustic on the ball. He scooped it across to Goodwin,18 yards out to the left of centre. He chested the ball and hit the sweetest strike back across Matar into the far corner. Goodwin’s left foot is one big sweet spot tonight. Craig Goodwin is having a helluva night out – he has just scored a beauty to make it 3-0. Goodwin’s big, in-swinging free-kick from the right was met inevitably by Souttar. His downward header was well saved by Matar, diving to his right, but the ball hit Jradi and rebounded miserably into the net. The Socceroos scored in the second minute of the first half; they’ve done it again at the start of the second. 46 min Lajud is booked within 30 seconds of coming on. He pulled back Mitch Duke, who was breaking dangerously down the right. 46 min Lebanon get the second half under way. Half-time substitution Lebanon are bringing on Daniel Lajud, so impressive as substitute on Thursday, for Hassan Chaitou. Half-time reading This is terrific* piece from Jonathan Liew, who once again won Columnist of the Year at last night’s big Sports Journalists’ Association bash in London. * And slightly dispiriting, because we’ve cocked this human experiment thing up, haven’t we Australia lead in Canberra. The first half was essentially an ode to the left foot of Craig Goodwin. His unplayable cross set up Kusini Yengi’s early goal, Yengi’s first for the Socceroos, and an equally delicious ball was headed against the post by Harry Souttar just before half-time. Lebanon had some promising moments, usually when their captain Hassan Maatouk was on the ball, but Maty Ryan didn’t have a save to make.

That was a clear foul and probably a yellow card. 45 min Four minutes of added time. 43 min: Souttar hits the post! Oof, how has he missed that? Goodwin took a short corner on the left, got it back and teased a gorgeous deep cross with the outside of the left foot. It curved onto the head of Souttar, whose downward header from six yards hit the post. For a goal machine like Souttar, that was a great chance. 42 min Corner to Australia on the right.

Alan Titchmarsh’s jeans blurred by North Korean TV censors,"His calm demeanour and wholesome vocation have apparently endeared him to one of the most authoritarian regimes in the world. But there is something about Alan Titchmarsh that North Korea’s censors can’t quite forgive – his jeans. The green-fingered broadcaster and author of raunchy novels has been a fixture on state television since 2022, albeit with the addition of a blurred effect from the waist down. By wearing jeans to potter about in Britain’s gardens in his BBC TV series Garden Secrets, Titchmarsh, 74, fell foul of a North Korean ban on the garments, which the regime has forbidden since the early 1990s because they are seen as a symbol of US imperialism. In an episode aired on Monday and set in the gardens of the 17th-century Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, Titchmarsh can be seen kneeling in soil, the sleeves of his checked shirt rolled up, plant pots and pruning shears at the ready. His jeans, however, are blurred, though not enough to conceal the fact that he is wearing denim. North Korea’s censors edit to 15 minutes each hour-long episode of the series, which was first shown in the UK in 2010, and mask Titchmarsh’s commentary with North Korean narrators, as well as adding a soundtrack of instrumental music, according to the NK News website. It is, however, just possible to make out the presenter’s dulcet Yorkshire tones in the background. Titchmarsh’s unlikely celebrity in North Korea was noticed in 2022, but media coverage did not pick up on his obscured jeans. “I never imagined that my programmes would reach North Korea, but hopefully the calming nature of British gardening will be well received there,” he said at the time. The censoring of Titchmarsh’s wardrobe is part of a campaign to shield North Koreans from the “malign” influence of western culture that began under the former leader, Kim Jong-il. While his son, the leader Kim Jong-un, has permitted his entourage to use Ford Transit vans and is a fan of NBA basketball, he has warned against allowing “bourgeois culture” and “anti-socialist behaviour” to undermine North Korea’s socialist project. In 2022, the US government-funded Radio Free Asia said the regime was cracking down on “capitalist” fashion and hairstyles, targeting skinny jeans and T-shirts bearing foreign words, as well as dyed or long hair, it said. The clampdown, an unnamed female source in North Korea told the broadcaster, “mainly targets women in their 20s and 30s. If they are caught, they are made to wait on the side of the road until the patrols can finish their crackdown in that area. “Only then will they be taken to the youth league office in the district, where they must write letters confessing their crimes. They must then contact someone at home to bring acceptable clothes for them, and then they are released.” The ban on jeans does not appear to extend to western tourists, who are permitted to dress as they please when they visit the North. It is not clear how, or if, the regime acquired the rights to Garden Secrets. North Korea regularly airs “politically neutral” material from abroad, including sports and science and technology programmes, NK News said, adding that it was likely that the gardening series had been pirated to get around international sanctions imposed in response to the North’s development of nuclear weapons.",2024-03-26T09:04:39Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/26/alan-titchmarsh-jeans-north-korean-tv-censors,The Guardian
Tuesday briefing: Why the US and UK are going public with warnings about Chinese hacking,"Good morning. You’re probably not an MP or peer on the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), so that part of yesterday’s cyber-attack revelations needn’t concern you excessively. If you are among the 40 million UK voters included on a register held by the Electoral Commission, though, I have bad news: the Chinese government has your personal details. Yesterday afternoon, deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden laid out sanctions in response to the attacks – in the case of the Electoral Commission hack, more than three years after it happened. In co-ordinated announcements, the US announced sanctions over a years-long campaign involving 10,000 malicious emails sent to politicians, journalists and businesses, and New Zealand said it had raised concerns with Beijing over an attack on its parliament in 2021. Taken together, the announcements represent an attempt to raise the alarm globally about the sheer scale of Chinese hacking – but Beijing is unlikely to be cowed. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Jamie MacColl, a research fellow in cybersecurity at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), about whether these are isolated incidents, or the tip of a digital iceberg. Here are the headlines. Israel-Gaza war | The UN security council has voted to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the first time after the US dropped a threat to veto, bringing Israel to near total isolation on the world stage. Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a planned White House visit by two ministers, while the Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the result a belated “vote for humanity to prevail”. US news | A New York court has handed Donald Trump a lifeline, reducing his $454m bond to $175m over the judgment against him in a huge fraud case. Separately, the judge overseeing the hush-money case against Trump involving the adult film star Stormy Daniels refused to delay the trial, setting a date for jury selection of 15 April. Garrick club | At least four senior judges, Sir Keith Lindblom, Sir Nicholas Cusworth, Sir Nicholas Lavender and Sir Ian Dove, have resigned from the men-only Garrick Club, the Judicial Office has said, as men in the legal profession come under increasing pressure over their close association with an organisation that has repeatedly blocked attempts to allow women to join. US news | Federal agents have raided properties in Los Angeles, Miami and New York that local news outlets have reported are tied to rapper and mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs. US media reported that the searches were part of a sex trafficking investigation, though the exact reason for the raids remained unclear. Conservatives | Rishi Sunak is to face another tricky byelection after former Conservative backbencher Scott Benton resigned before the conclusion of a recall petition among his constituents. The Blackpool South MP was facing likely ejection from the Commons after being suspended for 35 days over his role in a lobbying scandal. Both the US and UK have blamed a Chinese state-backed group they call Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (APT 31). New Zealand blamed a separate group, APT 40. While the UK’s decision to point the finger at China has grabbed headlines, the truth about attacks like the ones described by Oliver Dowden yesterday is that they are “pretty routine”, said Jamie MacColl. “We know that China, North Korea, Russia and Iran [sometimes known as the ‘big four’ cyber threats] are regularly called out,” he said. “There’s less public information or reporting about similar activities from Five Eyes [the anglophone intelligence alliance between the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand] – but that may be because we’re better at it, or care more about being caught, or don’t get identified by US and UK cybersecurity companies because of their relationships. It’s what you would expect powerful states to be doing to one another in cyberspace.” In a sense, though, the routine nature of some of this is part of what makes it ominous. “Interference in politics or democratic processes is always a very serious cyber threat,” MacColl said. “Even if we know what’s happened, we don’t know how it is intended to be used.” The Electoral Commission hack The attack on the Electoral Commission was carried out in August 2021, discovered in October 2022, and only publicly acknowledged in August 2023. Without specifying who was responsible, the Electoral Commission said hackers had gained access to copies of electoral registers with the names and addresses of anyone registered to vote in the UK between 2014 and 2022. Many commentators surmised that Russia was likely behind the incident; in fact, Oliver Dowden said yesterday, “these actions demonstrate a clear and persistent pattern of behaviour that signals hostile intent from China”. The Electoral Commission hack fits with China’s modus operandi for some years, MacColl said. “We’ve seen China targeting very large datasets of information on individuals before,” he said, pointing to a hack of the US Office of Personnel Management in 2015. “There have been similar operations against airlines and insurers.” It’s unlikely that the hack would have been carried out to obtain the details of specific people, MacColl said. “If you want to target a high-profile individual, there are easier ways than sorting through 40m lines on Excel. But it is possible that these datasets are being obtained for some future use, potentially highly individualised disinformation operations. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it may be that in 10 years, with much better machine learning, it’ll be possible to process this information in much more powerful ways.” As evidence for China’s interest in that area, he points to a recent leak from iSoon, a private company headquartered in Shanghai that sells its services to the Chinese government. “Their business critical services were less about the offensive side and more about processing these very large datasets so they can then be exploited.” That same iSoon leak appears to show staff at the company discussing potential attacks on thinktank Chatham House and the NGO Human Rights Watch, as well as the Home Office and Foreign Office. The attack on MPs and peers As well as the Electoral Commission hack, China was also accused yesterday of targeting a group of MPs and peers who are members of Ipac – with the four named politicians all vocal critics of China. One of the MPs, Iain Duncan Smith, said at a press conference yesterday that “the west has to wake up to the fact this is a challenge to the very way that we live our lives”. Like the US hack, the politicians’ email accounts are believed to have been targeted through “spear phishing” – emails that attempt to extract passwords and other sensitive information from targets by appearing to come from an authoritative or trusted source. The US said that the phishing emails contained hidden tracking links which would then send information including the recipient’s location, device and IP to a server controlled by the hackers – which then enabled more targeted follow-up attacks. The UK said that no parliamentary accounts were successfully compromised. While any cyber-attack on an elected official is a problem, it is also “much less significant than targeting the electoral roll, because it isn’t a large-scale way of interfering in democratic processes”, MacColl said. “Targeting individuals in this way falls into the category of fairly routine political intelligence that we would expect a state competing with us to be attempting.” The UK’s defences Yesterday, Rishi Sunak said that the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NTSC) is “world leading”. “It’s true that the UK is very good at cyber,” MacColl said. “But I would characterise it as ‘capable but constrained’ – cybercrime, counter-terrorism, and the war in Ukraine will have eaten up a lot of focus over the last two years.” He also noted that the private sector is now “able to respond in a way that far outweighs what the UK – or even the US – government can do. It’s no coincidence that when a government department or a council gets hit, it’s not the NTSC that does the legwork of fixing it.” To identify the culprit in these kinds of cases, “there will be forensic indicators from things like logs on servers – they will hope to assess those against known examples from different state actors”, MacColl said. Cautioning that he is simplifying considerably, he added: “They might have an IP address that will have been masked in different ways, and which they will try to trace – some have been linked to specific cities or even buildings in China in the past.” The political response China has dismissed the allegations as “malicious slander”. But both the US and UK announced sanctions yesterday against two individuals, Zhao Guangzong and Ni Gaobin, affiliated with a tech company which the US says is a front for the Chinese ministry of state security. They will face travel bans and an asset freeze. There have been criticisms over the pace of the UK’s response, given that more than three years have elapsed since the attack. The move to attribute these cases is likely to be political as much as technical, MacColl said: “It would not be happening without the broader strategic context of terrible relations between the UK and the US and China.” The measures met with some criticism for being inadequate to the scale of the threat – with one of the targeted MPs, the SNP’s Stewart McDonald, accusing ministers of “turning up at a gun fight with a wooden spoon”. They do signal a growing willingness to go public with warnings about Chinese hacking – and greater co-operation between western nations in response. But the sanctions do not appear likely to slow the pace of the Chinese hacking effort.

‘Beyond shocked’: Shohei Ohtani says interpreter stole from him and told lies,"Shohei Ohtani addressed the media on Monday after allegations emerged that his former interpreter stole millions of dollars from his bank account to pay an illegal bookmaker. The Los Angeles Dodgers star, the most famous active baseball player in the world and a huge celebrity in his native Japan, addressed journalists in a press conference but did not take any questions from the media. Last week, Ippei Mizuhara told ESPN that Ohtani had agreed to pay off his interpreter’s gambling debts, which are said to be more than $1m. Mizuhara had placed bets with a bookmaker in California, where gambling is illegal. However, Ohtani’s lawyers soon issued a statement saying Ohtani had been a victim of “massive theft” orchestrated by Mizuhara. In a subsequent interview with ESPN, Mizuhara said he had lied in his initial statement and that Ohtani knew nothing about the gambling debts. Ohtani said he had no idea Mizuhara was going to speak to the media last week, and he only became aware of the interpreter’s gambling problem during a team meeting last week. “All of this has been a complete lie,” Ohtani said on Monday. “Ippei obviously basically didn’t tell me about the media inquiry. So Ippei has been telling everyone around that he has been communicating with me on this account to the media and my team and that hasn’t been true.” Mizuhara, who had a close bond with Ohtani beyond their working relationship, was fired and Major League Baseball later opened an investigation. Ohtani said he had never bet on any sports or knowingly sent money to his former interpreter to cover gambling debts. “[I am] beyond shocked, it’s hard to verbalise how I am feeling at this point,” he said in a prepared statement through his new interpreter, Will Ireton. MLB players are forbidden from betting on baseball, and face a lifetime ban if found to have placed a wager on their own team. They are allowed to bet on other sports in the nearly 40 US states where gambling is legal, but not in California. “I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to do it on my behalf and I have never gone through a bookmaker to bet on sports, and was never asked to assist betting payments for anyone else,” Ohtani said. Mizuhara had been Ohtani’s translator since the star moved from Japan to play for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani joined the Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal. He made his Dodgers debut on Wednesday in a victory over the San Diego Padres in South Korea last week. “Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has told lies,” Ohtani said. Mizuhara said last week that Ohtani did not place any bets himself. “I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting,” he said. The IRS says Mizuhara is under criminal investigation over the allegations.",2024-03-25T22:20:31Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/25/shohei-ohtani-interpreter-gambling-allegations-mlb-baseball,The Guardian
Israel-Gaza war: US says it will ‘find ways’ to warn Israel against Rafah attack despite cancellation of visit – as it happened,"Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has hit back at comments by his war cabinet minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, over the decision to cancel a planned trip for top Israeli officials to Washington over the US decision not to veto the UN security council resolution. The Israeli delegation that was supposed to visit Washington on Tuesday should continue, Gantz argued in a social media post. He wrote: Not only is it right for the delegation to travel – the prime minister would do well if he himself traveled to the USA, and held a direct dialogue with President Biden and the senior administration officials. Gantz, who met with top US leaders during a visit to Washington earlier this month, added: At the same time, it is important to remember – the special relationship between Israel and the United States is an anchor in Israel’s security and foreign relations, and the direct dialogue with the American administration is an essential asset that must not be given up even when there are challenges and disputes. Netanyahu’s office responded that the Israeli leader “rejected the proposal” by Gantz in a statement that said: After Hamas welcomed the Security Council decision that was passed by way of the USA’s abstention, Gantz proposes that a delegation visit the USA. The Prime Minister has rejected his proposal. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: At least 32,333 Palestinians have been killed and 74,694 injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday. The latest figures include at least 21 Palestinians who were reportedly killed by an Israeli airstrike on an apartment block in central Gaza late on Sunday. The UN security council voted to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, after the US dropped a threat to veto, in a significant break with the Israeli government, bringing it to near total isolation on the world stage. The US abstained in a vote in Monday’s security council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan”. It also demanded the release of hostages by Hamas, but did not make the ceasefire dependent on hostage release, a linkage the US had previously insisted on. Hamas welcomed the resolution and said it stood ready for an immediate exchange of prisoners with Israel, raising hopes of a breakthrough in negotiations under way in Doha, where intelligence chiefs and other officials from the US, Egypt and Qatar are seeking to broker a deal that would involve the release of some hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian detainees and prisoners, and a truce that would last an initial six weeks. After the UN vote, the office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a planned visit to Washington by two of his ministers, intended to discuss a planned Israeli offensive on Rafah, which the US opposes. The White House said it was “very disappointed” by the decision. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz argued that the visit should go ahead. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, will still meet with US defense secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior US officials despite the cancellation of a separate visit by an Israeli delegation to Washington. The meeting, set to take place at the Pentagon on Tuesday, will cover a range of topics including the release of hostages held by Hamas and the need for more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the Pentagon’s press secretary said. Israel confirmed it will cease working with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), accusing the organisation of “perpetuating the conflict”. Unrwa has provided essential services to the Palestinians in the occupied territories for decades, and has been at the centre of a bitter controversy after being accused by Israel of collaborating with Hamas in Gaza – a charge it has denied. The medical situation in Gaza’s hospitals has reached an “unimaginable” state of crisis, according to an emergency medical team organised by three aid groups that spent two weeks carrying out surgeries and other care at the European hospital near Khan Younis. Israel’s foreign ministry said Spain, Malta, Slovenia and Ireland are offering “a reward for terrorism” with a joint statement about their readiness to recognise a Palestinian state. Israel has repeatedly insisted that the only way progress towards a two-state solution can be made is by direct talks between Israel and Palestinian authorities that it recognises. Palestinians have argued that this effectively grants Israel a veto over statehood. The US has said it will “find other ways to make our concerns known” regarding Israel’s planned military operation in Rafah despite the decision by Benjamin Netanyahu to scrap an Israeli delegation visit to Washington. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will likely discuss Rafah with visiting Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. He said: We believe this type of full-scale invasion would be a mistake, not just because of the civilian harm that it would cost which would be immense. He added there are currently about 1.4m people in Rafah and Israel has not presented a coherent evacuation plan, adding: This type of invasion would weaken Israel’s security and would make Israel less safe, not more safe. It would undermine its standing in the world. Miller said that while Blinken will likely discuss US concerns over a Rafah invasion during his meeting with Gallant, the secretary of state would not be presenting Washington’s alternative plans for a military operation in the southern Gaza city. The White House has said it was “perplexed” and “disappointed” by Israel’s decision to cancel its delegation’s planned visit to Washington to discuss US concerns over a possible offensive in Rafah. The office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced it would cancel the visit after the US dropped a threat to veto a UN security council resolution to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “We’re kind of perplexed” by the cancellation, the White House’s national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. He added that the Israeli prime minister’s office seemed to be “choosing to create a perception of daylight here when they don’t need to do that.” US officials had been in touch with Israel throughout the weekend to make Washington’s position known on the UN security council resolution, and to articulate that it was not a change in policy or in support for Israel, a US official told AP. Netanyahu did not talk to US president Joe Biden before he canceled the delegation’s trip, and Biden doesn’t have any immediate plans to phone Netanyahu, the official added. Kirby had earlier said Washington was “very disappointed” the delegation would not be visiting. While the delegation’s trip has been canceled, a separate visit by Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, is proceeding. An Israeli minister, Gideon Saar, has resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency unity government, citing the fact that he was not included in the country’s highest-level war cabinet. Saar joined the unity government along with several other members of the opposition after the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. His departure, reported by Reuters, is not expected to affect the stability of Netanyahu’s government, which still controls a clear majority in parliament. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has hit back at comments by his war cabinet minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, over the decision to cancel a planned trip for top Israeli officials to Washington over the US decision not to veto the UN security council resolution. The Israeli delegation that was supposed to visit Washington on Tuesday should continue, Gantz argued in a social media post. He wrote: Not only is it right for the delegation to travel – the prime minister would do well if he himself traveled to the USA, and held a direct dialogue with President Biden and the senior administration officials. Gantz, who met with top US leaders during a visit to Washington earlier this month, added: At the same time, it is important to remember – the special relationship between Israel and the United States is an anchor in Israel’s security and foreign relations, and the direct dialogue with the American administration is an essential asset that must not be given up even when there are challenges and disputes. Netanyahu’s office responded that the Israeli leader “rejected the proposal” by Gantz in a statement that said: After Hamas welcomed the Security Council decision that was passed by way of the USA’s abstention, Gantz proposes that a delegation visit the USA. The Prime Minister has rejected his proposal. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has cancelled a scheduled Washington trip for top aides Ron Dermer and Tzachi Hanegbi in response to the US’s decision not to use veto power in the UN security council resolution for a ceasefire without hostage release conditions, according to media reports. Israel accuses the US of undermining war efforts and hostage release attempts, calling it a departure from prior US stance in the security council. The statement calls the decision “a clear retreat from the consistent US position in the Security Council since the beginning of the war,” and one that “gives Hamas hope that international pressure will allow them to get a ceasefire without releasing our hostages,’’ the Times of Israel has reported. The Israeli minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, in response to the UN security council resolution said: The decision of the UN Security Council proves what has been known since time immemorial - this is an anti-Semitic institution, with an anti-Semitic Secretary General, who is encouraging Hamas towards total victory. President Biden’s choice, on the other hand, to avoid vetoing the decision on the part of the USA, proves on the other hand that President Biden does not put the victory of Israel and the free world over terrorism at the top of his priorities, but rather his political considerations. Precisely after this decision, we must increase the intensity of the war and continue striving with all our might, at any cost, to defeat Hamas.  This post was amended on 26 March 2024 to correct the spelling of Itamar Ben-Gvir’s surname. The former US president Donald Trump has said he would have responded to the 7 October Hamas attacks in the same way that Israel did, but argued Israel was losing international support and should wrap up its war in Gaza. Hamas’ killing spree through southern Israel was “one of the saddest things I’ve ever seen”, Trump said in an interview with Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom published on Monday, but: You have to finish up your war. To finish it up. You gotta get it done. And, I am sure you will do that. And we gotta get to peace, we can’t have this going on. And I will say, Israel has to be very careful, because you’re losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done. The secretary general of the Palestinian Authority’s executive committee, Hussein al-Sheikh, has welcomed the UN security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. We welcome the #UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the #Gaza Strip. We call for a permanent cessation to this criminal war and Israel's immediate withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. https://t.co/woxJznMwQo The 2025 European gymnastics championships will not be staged in Tel Aviv as scheduled because of Israel’s war with Hamas, its governing body announced. In a statement, the governing body of gymnastics in Europe cited “the current situation in Israel” as its reason and said it was reopening the bidding process for a host. It added: We acknowledge the efforts done by the Israeli Gymnastics Federation, the excellent host of several European Championships in the past 8 years. The UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza sent a clear message that the hostages held by Hamas should be released and aid should allowed in to Gaza, Downing Street has said. The UK backed the resolution, which demanded the release of hostages but did not make the ceasefire dependent on hostage release. A spokesperson for the UK prime minister said: We have long called for an immediate humanitarian pause or temporary ceasefire leading to a sustainable ceasefire, which is what this resolution calls for. And that is why the UK voted in favour of it. They said Israel had a right to defend itself, but that “far too many” Palestinians had been killed “and a humanitarian catastrophe is a clear and present risk”. Asked what message the UK government would send to Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Downing Street said: We would obviously urge both sides to listen to that and to follow this resolution. ActionAid has condemned Israel’s decision to block the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza. Unrwa head Philippe Lazzarini, in a social media post on Sunday, said Israeli authorities had informed the UN that they will no longer approve any Unrwa food convoys to the north of Gaza, where the threat of famine is highest. An Israeli official confirmed earlier today that Israel will cease working with the UN agency, accusing the organisation of “perpuating the conflict”. 📍# Gaza: as of today, @UNRWA, the main lifeline for #Palestine Refugees, is denied from providing lifesaving assistance to northern Gaza. Despite the tragedy unfolding under our watch, the Israeli Authorities informed the UN that they will no longer approve  any @UNRWA food… pic.twitter.com/lfp9xRQuh1 ActionAid Palestine’s advocacy and communications coordinator, Riham Jafari, said in a statement: We are utterly horrified and outraged to see Israel pull the plug on the most vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza on the brink of famine right now. With severe hunger claiming children’s lives and severely malnourished women giving birth to stillborn babies, Israel’s decision to cease working with UNRWA is nothing short of a death sentence for those living through immense hunger and suffering. A UN-backed food security assessment has warned that famine was projected to hit the north of Gaza by May unless there was urgent intervention. Unrwa has not been able to deliver food to the north since 29 January, a spokesperson has said. Hamas has welcomed the UN security council resolution and said it stands ready to engage the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. In a statement posted to social media, Hamas said a pause in fighting is needed to “bury our martyrs who have remained under the rubble for months” and for access to “humanitarian needs”. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has welcomed the adoption by the UN security council of a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Von der Leyen, in a social media post, said that implementation of the resolution is “vital for the protection of all civilians”. I welcome the adoption by UN Security Council of a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and the immediate & unconditional release of all hostages.Implementation of this resolution is vital for the protection of all civilians. Here’s the full text of the UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza that was passed on Monday after the US dropped a threat to veto, in a significant break with the Israeli government. The text of the resolution 2728 just adopted by the Council pic.twitter.com/YJpbBUgeW2 Aid groups have been responding to the UN security council vote to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the month of Ramadan. A statement by the International Rescue Committee calls the UN resolution “a critical turning point” and warns that without a ceasefire that is respected by all parties, Gaza risks facing further catastrophe. It adds: IRC urges Council members, including the United Kingdom, to leverage all their influence to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities and work towards a lasting ceasefire. The UN resolution is a “welcome step forward but long overdue,” according to a statement by Care International UK, which warns that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would have “utterly dire” consequences for civilians, including women and girls. It adds: With famine imminent in Gaza, an immediate ceasefire is the only way to reduce the death toll. The resolution must be implemented, there is no time to lose. Oxfam says it welcomes the UN resolution, but argues that while it is a “step in the right direction"" that it “falls short of the permanent ceasefire which is truly required and comes too late for over 32,000 Palestinians in Gaza that have been killed, and thousands more unaccounted for, while the Security Council wrung its hands over semantics.” It adds: A mere two-week pause is not enough. This initial cessation in violence must lead to a permanent ceasefire that lasts and sustainable peace for Palestinians and Israelis alike; so people in Gaza can mourn their loved ones and begin the long road of recovery and reconstruction. A meeting between the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, and Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, in Washington is still expected to take place, the Pentagon’s press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder has said. The meeting, set to take place at the Pentagon tomorrow, will cover a range of topics including the release of hostages held by Hamas and the need for more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he added. The White House has said it is “very disappointed” that Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a high-level Israeli delegation’s planned visit to Washington after the US abstained from a UN security council vote demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. As we reported earlier, Netanyahu’s office announced that a planned visit to Washington by Israeli officials, which was to include Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and head of Israel’s national security council, Tzachi Hanegbi, will no longer take place. White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters: It’s disapppointing. We’re very disappointed that they won’t be coming to Washington DC. to allow us to have a fulsome conversation with them about viable alternatives to them going in on the ground in Rafah. A separate set of talks between Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, who is already currently in Washington, and senior US officials is expected to take place.",2024-03-25T19:21:56Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/25/israel-gaza-live-unrwa-aid-north-gaza-un-security-council-vote-ceasefire-middle-east-latest,The Guardian
Vaping debate: doctor’s reticence over declaring tobacco money raises questions about conflict of interest,"A GP opposed to the government’s vaping reforms and whose nicotine prescription website is being assessed by the drug regulator has given school vaping education sessions and spoken at a student conference without declaring she has received financial support from a tobacco company. Dr Carolyn Beaumont owns the vaping telehealth service medicalnicotine.com.au, which allows people to obtain a prescription for nicotine vapes in minutes, without speaking directly to a doctor or pharmacist. The Medical Board of Australia confirmed that this was legal but said the lack of real-time direct consultation was not good practice. The platform is among a number of vaping prescription websites under assessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for potentially encouraging patients to request a particular prescription medicine. In September 2023 Beaumont spoke at the tobacco industry’s Global Forum on Nicotine in Seoul, South Korea, with the forum covering her expenses to attend. She is also a recipient of a Knowledge-Action-Change tobacco harm reduction scholarship. KAC has received funding from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which in turn is funded by Philip Morris International. Beaumont’s biography for the Global Forum on Nicotine says that as a recipient of the scholarship she is “creating an educational presentation on tobacco harm reduction for Australian medical students”. In June Beaumont spoke on a panel titled Media, Medicine and the Vaping Epidemic at the University of Melbourne’s medical student conference. A University of Melbourne spokesperson said the panellists had been asked to declare any conflicts of interest. “Dr Beaumont declared that she had no conflicts of interest,” the spokesperson said. “At the commencement of the panel session at the conference, all speakers were asked to identify any relationships with industry/research funding. As Dr Beaumont declared no conflict of interest, no declaration was included in the visual display nor was a verbal declaration made.” On her medicalnicotine.com.au website, Beaumont says she runs education sessions for secondary school students and parents about “teenage vaping concerns, and the dangers of becoming addicted to nicotine”. Her website previously included an endorsement from Beaumaris Secondary College, a Victorian government school. A Victorian government spokesperson said Beaumont “proactively approached Beaumaris Secondary College, volunteering to present”. The spokesperson said Beaumont did not declare to the school benefits received from the tobacco or vaping industry: “She did not seek the school’s approval to reference it in promotional materials, and was not paid for her services.” There is no policy requiring guest speakers who are running an education program in schools to disclose any potential conflicts of interests. Guardian Australia understands that policy is now under review.

After she was contacted for a response, a conflict of interest declaration was added to her website. It says that due to the cost of international travel, and without research institution funding, “it has been necessary on occasion to have travel costs covered in part by [the] tobacco industry”. “Note that any such arrangements have been completely unconditional, and have never influenced my clinical decisions.” In the statement Beaumont says “on the balance of evidence” she supports tobacco harm reduction and the role of vaping for adult smokers, as well as reducing youth uptake and “removing the blackmarket”. “Occasional unconditional tobacco-industry funded travel costs are required to achieve these aims, in the absence of alternative sources of funding.” She says the decision to accept such funding is “never made lightly”, and she has “never sought to hide” these sources of funding. Beaumont is opposed to federal government efforts aimed at reducing the supply of nicotine vaping products, including an import ban on disposable vapes. The government has said the aim of its reforms is to reduce supply to children, and they are not intended to criminalise individuals who use vapes, whether adults or children. On her website Beaumont states: “I am passionate about educating teenagers about the real risks of blackmarket vaping – unregulated products with unknown nicotine content, electrical safety hazards, no quality control and unknown levels of harmful contaminants.” In an interview with the Global Forum on Nicotine’s media channel in December, Beaumont spoke of her hopes for 2024, saying: “What I most wish for is for the Australian ban on disposable vapes scheduled to occur on New Year’s Day to be stopped. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “I wish for the planned ban on all personal importation of any vapes scheduled for March to be stopped. I wish for the Australian prescription model of vaping to stop and for the barriers to accessing a doctor to be truly understood and acknowledged.” Despite this, Beaumont operates her own prescription vaping telehealth platform, medicalnicotine.com.au. Guardian Australia followed the steps for obtaining a script online through the site in late February. A Medicare number was not required to be entered, nor was a phone or video consultation needed. After declaring that they are over 16 (which has since been changed to 18) and paying $40, patients are directed to fill out a short questionnaire to receive a script for a six-month supply of vapes, which must be used at the online pharmacy QuickRx. Patients can choose their own vape strength as part of this process, along with their preferred product – pods, disposable vapes or liquid nicotine. Patients are not required to try first-line, evidence-based treatments first. They can simply tick a box stating: “I am not interested in nicotine replacement therapies.” Guardian Australia selected “I wasn’t a regular smoker, but have started vaping instead of taking up smoking (because I have found other benefits to it)” as the reason for wanting a prescription. A spokesperson for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said: “Nicotine vaping products are not recommended for first-line smoking cessation, but may be suitable for smoking cessation in conjunction with behavioural support where first-line therapies have failed. “It is not recommended that non-smokers or non-vapers start vaping.” The spokesperson said patients should also be informed that due to the lack of available evidence, the long-term health effects of nicotine vaping products are unknown; that their safety and quality have not been established; that the lack of uniformity in vaping devices increases the uncertainties and risks associated with their use; and dual use of tobacco and vapes should be avoided. The importance of the patient returning for regular review and monitoring should be emphasised, they said. None of these were communicated in the process of obtaining a prescription from Beaumont’s site. Some parts of the form and questions have been updated since inquiries were made by Guardian Australia. Beaumont did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about accessing a prescription but did comment on an article about vaping on the Medical Republic site. In the comments section, she appeared to refer to some of the questions put to her by Guardian Australia. Beaumont set out why she did not do phone or video consults: “Firstly, timezones. “I’m in Victoria, and many patients are from WA,” she wrote. “There’s a 3 hour gap, so realistically I can’t make calls until midday. Consider also that as a whole, heavy smokers are more likely to work jobs such as construction, mining or hospitality. These jobs don’t lend themselves to taking time out for a phone consult.” She wrote that she disagreed with the Medical Board that telehealth without a phone or video consult was not best medical practice.

Jessie Diggins: ‘Eating disorders are about control when you feel like you have none’,"Cross-country skiing at the elite level feels closer to survivalism than sport, a staredown with existential resistance that requires a tolerance for suffering bordering on inhumane and an appetite for pushing past the outer limits of what the body and mind believe is possible. Jessie Diggins calls it the “pain cave”, the place that endurance athletes enter when they’ve willed themselves beyond their breaking point and every muscle group is gripped with an agony that would leave the rest of us mortals supine and helpless along the trail. Diggins’ hard-won mastery of this aerobic mental and physical torture chamber is what’s carried her from small-town Minnesota to the summit of a sport that was dominated by Europeans for more than a century. That is, until she came along. It’s been four days since Diggins nailed down her second World Cup overall title to put the finishing touches on the most successful season ever for an American cross-country skier. The 32-year-old from the tiny St Paul suburb of Afton (population: 2,951), whose trademark glitter, megawatt smile and almost nuclear positivity have become her calling cards, could clinch the crown with no worse than a 20th-place finish in last Sunday’s season-ending women’s 20km mass start freestyle in the Swedish town of Falun. But rather than playing it safe, Diggins conjured a sensational knockout blow on a course tailor-made to her strengths. Clustered with a gaggle of rivals entering the closing 2.5km, Diggins broke free with one final lung-busting sprint and crossed the finish line first by ninth-tenths of a second ahead of Norway’s Heidi Weng for her sixth individual win of the season, cementing herself as the world’s most dominant cross-country skier. “Even though there was a lot of noise and a lot of pressure and a lot going on, I was racing with a lot of joy and truly having fun,” says Diggins, filling my screen with sparkle and warmth as she grapples with her latest swipe at history. “It felt like making it to the finish line of a four-month season, not just the finish line of a 20km race.” There may not be a fitter athlete than Diggins who, after more than a decade in cross-country skiing’s top flight, is at the height of her powers. Speaking on Zoom from her Massachusetts home, Diggins rates her strength, endurance and technique as better than ever, the result of “putting money in the bank” through countless training hours. Same for her tactical confidence; in mass start races, where all competitors start at the same time and the first skier across the finish line is the winner, she knows when she can get to the front, when she can tuck in the back, when she needs to move around in the pack. Be disarmed by the bubbly demeanor at your peril. Beneath the Minnesota nice is a unyielding competitor willing to persist through pain unimaginable to the outside observer. No woman from outside Europe had ever won the overall crystal globe, cross-country skiing’s biggest prize, until Diggins three years ago. Now she’s done it twice. But her career-best campaign was nearly derailed before it started last summer when she experienced a relapse of an eating disorder after more than 12 years of recovery. As the start of the season drew near, she went public with her struggle on social media and spoke with remarkable candor and vulnerability on her “constant battle” with a condition that will affect nearly 10% of Americans at some point in their lives. “There’s so much stigma and misinformation out there,” Diggins tells me. “Eating disorders are a mental illness, not a behavioral choice. It can affect anyone of any age, any race, any background. It’s not just something that targets skinny white teenage women, right? Because that is often what people think of. That’s not necessarily the case. “The other thing people should understand is it may, and in fact it often is, not at all about food or your body. It’s about looking for a feeling of control when you feel like you have none in your life. It’s about looking for an illusion of feeling safe when you feel like things are spiraling out of your control. So for me, I had been working too hard for too long and I was feeling incredibly overwhelmed and my eating disorder served as a crutch to kind of numb these overwhelming feelings when I felt like I couldn’t deal with them.” Diggins was 18, and had just graduated high school, when a mounting battle with bulimia nervosa led her to the doors of the Emily Program, a Minnesota-based recovery treatment center. There she assembled a support group that included a therapist, a dietician, a physician and a sports psychologist who she still works with to this day. “I have had wonderful consistency in someone who knows my complete history, who knows me super well. We talk pretty much every single week and we’ve built up this very strong safety net in all the good times. When literally nothing is wrong in my life, we’re still going to talk about all things that are going on and figure out different systems so that if something goes wrong, we’re not scrambling. We build the safety net for when we need it,” she says. “And then when I did need it this year, we brought on a doctor who specializes in eating disorders and a sport dietician who also specializes in outpatient eating disorder recovery. We supplemented my care team with other professionals trained specifically in the eating disorder world.” That collective proved crucial to getting Diggins to the starting line when the season got under way in November. Her mantra from the outset was to “take it day by day, one race at a time”. She brims with gratitude for her teammates and coaches for accommodating the open-ended challenges that mental health treatment demands. “It’s very different than let’s say you break your arm and it’s like, alright, you can expect to have a cast on for this many weeks and then this happens and that happens, and you might not exactly stick to that timeline, but you have a pretty good idea of how this is going to go and how you’re going to heal and what that’s going to look like,” she says. “With mental health, you don’t have any of that, and that’s really, really challenging. There isn’t a definitive timeline, it’s not necessarily just linear progress. You might take three steps forward, one step back and so on. So I definitely wasn’t sure how this season was going to look. And it was really important to me that I didn’t commit to the entire season.” Diggins first made history at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, when she and Kikkan Randall won the team sprint in a heart-stopping finish over Sweden to earn the first ever US Olympic gold for cross-country skiing. But while the Olympics bring unparalleled attention, winning the crystal globe is cross-country skiing’s most difficult and prestigious feat, rewarding season-long consistency and durability across all disciplines. The grueling World Cup circuit is made up of 34 races from November to March across sprints and distance events in both classic and freestyle techniques, all of them contests of extreme physical and psychological intensity. No woman from outside Europe had ever won the overall World Cup title before Diggins during the Covid-shortened 2020-21 campaign. Winning it again was never going to be easy under the best of circumstances. Heartened by the support of her team, Diggins relied on her craft and fighting spirit to rack up results early and often. Amid subzero temperatures in a 20km freestyle race on the season-opening weekend in Ruka, Finland, just below the Arctic Circle, she managed to climb back through the pack and finish second after losing her right ski-pole and glove with about one mile left and suffering a bleeding gash, red-lining it through the final stretch with her right hand exposed to the elements. Think Eric Liddell on powder. Olihan veto Jessie Digginsiltä! Sauva poikki kärkipaikalta, hanska putosi matkasta, uusi sauva huollolta suoraan naamaan, naama auki ja silti taisteli itsensä toiseksi! 🥈#ViaplayTalvi pic.twitter.com/J0C9abADC6 Her first win of the year came the next week in a notice-serving 10k skate in Gällivare, Sweden. She went on to win the marquee Tour de Ski, a seven-stage, nine-day series of races modeled after the Tour de France that straddles the New Year, for the second time. By the middle of February, she’d opened a yawning lead of 340 points atop the overall leaderboard, spending more than 100 days wearing the yellow overall leader’s bib. Sweden’s Linn Svahn was able to narrow the gap to 75 points entering Sunday’s season finale, but Diggins closed in style for her sixth solo win of the year, surpassing Randall’s single-season American mark. She also secured her second distance crown, finishing 224 points ahead of Germany’s Victoria Carl. But for all the history made, records broken and rivals bested, what Diggins calls the highlight of her career happened in February when her long-sought dream of competing on home soil was realized with the Stifel Loppet Cup in Minneapolis, only 25 miles west of her hometown, drawing more than 40,000 spectators over two days to the first World Cup race to be staged in the US in 23 years. From the day after she’d won Olympic gold in South Korea, Diggins had made it her personal mission to leverage her elevated profile toward bringing the World Cup circuit back to the US, an exhaustive process that included courting sponsors behind the scenes. “It was surreal and I had dreamed about this for my entire career,” says Diggins, whose only exposure to World Cup races growing up was on the VHS tapes her father would buy at a local ski shop months after they took place. “It was something I’d always wanted. The biggest thing that I’d wanted to do is race at home and having 20,000 people each day, people screaming your name grown men wearing glitter all over their faces because they were cheering for me. It was so special to feel so connected to the ski community and to see what this sport meant to so many other people.” Moments like these comes few and far between in a sport that rarely captures the attention of the American public, even during the Winter Olympics. Compared to the heart-pounding velocity of alpine skiing, exhilarating beauty of figure skating and Nascar-on-ice voyeurism of short track, the grind of cross-country skiing has never been an easy sell for US audiences. But few have done more than Diggins to raise the sport’s profile. Before 2018, the United States had won only a single medal in cross-country skiing at the Olympics, back in 1976. By completing her color set in Beijing with a silver (in the 30km freestyle) and bronze (the individual sprint), Diggins tripled that haul by herself within a four-year span. When it comes to disadvantages facing US cross-country skiers, Diggins points to the comparatively small base of athletes and lack of funding relative to the Nordic countries, where the sport is far more popular and lucrative professionally. “We have to be really scrappy,” she says. “A lot of people who are racing World Cup are working second jobs, fundraising really hard to get over there. So you’re definitely in the sport for the right reasons, because you’re not in the sport to get rich and famous. I think that’s one of the reasons it draws such incredible people, but it also becomes a very big challenge and hurdle, and you don’t want anyone to have to give up their career dreams because of funding. That’s a hard reason to have to be done in the sport. And so that’s something that we’re always working on, is how do we support athletes as they work to get to that next level and take those next steps.” It’s no secret that many Olympians devote their lives to activities that aren’t exactly fast tracks to fame and fortune. But even by that standard, cross-country skiing is a hard bargain, right there with boxing for the least favorable pain-to-prestige ratio of any sport. Asked what keeps her motivated after more than half a lifetime in the pain cave and with so little remaining to achieve, Diggins’ infectious passion shoots to the surface. “I love the people and the culture,” she says. “This sport attracts really remarkable people and nobody’s too cool. You can’t be too cool when you’re covered in frozen snot and you’re exhausted at the finish line. It’s just such a humbling sport.” Opportunities to build on her legacy abound. The world championships, which are held every other winter, will take place next year in Norway. Beyond that, a fourth Olympic appearance at the 2026 Winter Games in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo is clearly there for the taking, where Diggins could round off her résumé as the first American to win an individual Olympic cross-country skiing gold. But for now, skiing can wait. Diggins will spend her offseason rewatching Ted Lasso, her new favorite show which, she keenly observes, “really nails it from a sports psychology perspective”, as well as hiking in Patagonia with her husband of two years on their long-delayed honeymoon. “I haven’t even thought about [next year],” Diggins says. “I think I’m still absorbing this season. I always want to improve my process. I always want to improve my technique. I always want to improve on those process-oriented goals. Honestly, I may not even set outcome-oriented goals. It just needs to stay about the process.” In the US, help is available at nationaleatingdisorders.org or by calling ANAD’s eating disorders hotline at 800-375-7767.

A minimum wage alone can’t fix the UK poverty scandal,"Next month will mark 25 years since the national minimum wage was first paid in Britain: a quarter of a century during which what was once seen as a radical leftwing policy has won broad cross-party support. Over the past 14 years, the Conservatives have appropriated and expanded the policy, despite adopting a laissez-faire approach to other aspects of labour market regulation. First set by then chancellor Gordon Brown at £3.60 an hour for over-21s, the minimum wage was part of Labour’s 1997 manifesto – though not deemed grabby enough to make it on to Tony Blair’s election pledge card. The Conservatives opposed the legislation as it made its way through parliament after the general election, warning that it would destroy jobs. Less than a year after it came into force, however, shadow chancellor Michael Portillo announced that his party would not reverse it, saying that at the “modest” level at which it had been set, the measure had done “less damage to employment than we feared”. Labour had worked painstakingly to build up support for the minimum wage in the run-up to 1997. The low pay commission (LPC), which would give the government independent advice on setting the pay floor, was to include representatives from business as well as trade unions and labour market experts. The LPC’s first report – published in 1998, after it had held more than 200 evidence-gathering meetings across the country – cited egregious cases of exploitation, including a security guard job advertised at £2 an hour, with the successful applicant expected to supply their own dog. During the coalition years that followed Labour’s defeat in 2010, the Conservatives used increases in the minimum wage as part of a bid to style themselves as the “workers’ party”. In 2015, George Osborne effectively rebranded the minimum wage as the “national living wage” – co-opting a name first used by grassroots group Citizens UK in its successful anti-poverty campaign – and set a surprisingly radical aspiration of lifting it to 60%, and later two-thirds, of median earnings. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader who had campaigned against poverty, punched the air in the House of Commons chamber when the policy was announced. This ambitious target meant the LPC had to continue recommending chunky increases in the minimum wage, as part of whatthe Resolution Foundation thinktank has called a “transformative” policy. By 2023, the UK’s minimum wage was higher, relative to average wages, than in any other rich country apart from France, New Zealand and South Korea. It helped to reduce hourly wage inequality and made some of the worst examples of poverty pay a thing of the past. And it is set to increase again, by almost 10%, on 1 April. Yet the national living wage has been a small island of progress in a labour market that has seen short-term, zero-hours contracts proliferate, out-of-work and sickness benefits eroded, and fire-and-rehire policies going unpunished. And while the rules are laudable, their enforcement is another ongoing issue: trade unions warn that HMRC, whose job it is to police the minimum wage, lacks the resources to do so effectively. At the same time, the number of people in the UK who are economically inactive for health reasons has hit a record high, at 2.8 million: the UK is an outlier among major economies in having a workforce that has shrunk since Covid. The national living wage is here to stay. An incoming Labour government would offer a “genuine living wage”, according to the shadow deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, as part of the party’s promise to build “a Britain that works for working people”. In practice, that will mean asking the LPC to take more account of the cost of living in setting the pay floor, though it is unclear whether that will make much difference, after a string of significant increases. What is clear, though, is that while the widely admired policy has tackled a longstanding bugbear of the UK labour market – the prevalence of low pay – it left wider issues untouched. Last week’s figures showing that 300,000 children were plunged into poverty during the cost of living crisis, with hunger and deprivation rising, underlined the fact that while raising the minimum wage may be a necessary condition for tackling poverty in the UK, it is very far from sufficient.  This article was amended on 28 March 2024. An earlier version referred to Angela Rayner as the “deputy prime minister” when shadow deputy prime minister was meant.",2024-03-24T08:00:44Z,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/24/a-minimum-wage-alone-cant-fix-the-uk-poverty-scandal,The Guardian
Code Dependent by Madhumita Murgia review – understanding the human impacts of AI,"What’s in the box? That’s the question almost everyone that Madhumita Murgia speaks to seems to be asking. If the “black box” of the algorithm is going to make critical decisions about our health, education or human rights, it would be nice to know exactly what it contains. So long as it remains a mystery, what can you do if you find your child added to a list of potential future criminals based on flawed, even racist, data, as happened to hundreds of families in the Netherlands in the late 2010s?It’s these Kafkaesque absurdities, and how they play out on a human level, that interest Murgia, the Financial Times’s first artificial intelligence editor. Code, she reminds us several times in this troubling book, is not neutral. This isn’t a story about ChatGPT and the other large language models and their looming impact on everything from Hollywood to homework, though there is a bit of that. Instead, it’s an account of how the everyday algorithms we have already learned to live beside are changing us: from the people paid (not much) to make sense of vast datasets, to the unintended consequences of the biases they contain. It’s also the story of how the AI systems built using that data benefit many of us (you, ordering McDonald’s on UberEats) at the expense of some – usually individuals and communities that are already marginalised (the young immigrant worker picking up your Big Mac for a small fee). The scope of Murgia’s reporting here, reflective of her day job, is vast. She takes us from the sometimes comically basic way AI systems are trained (workers in a Kenyan office block labelling road signs to teach driverless cars to recognise them) to how its flaws play out in the finished product (the delivery drivers paid less because their app doesn’t account for delays caused by roadworks or having to cycle uphill). Murgia also argues that we are seeing the emergence of a new data colonialism. Yes, many subcontracted AI labourers are pulled out of poverty by this work, but the wealth created by it is not shared equitably. Then there’s the sheer monotony of it, the inability to deviate from instructions and regional disparities in pay and job security, not to mention the PTSD that results from being forced to look at the worst images on the internet so the rest of us don’t have to. And, crucially, because the AI supply chain is broken down into chunks, many of these workers are told nothing about the purpose of the task they have been given – or even who they’re working for. One Kenyan lawyer Murgia meets sees algorithm training as another version of the Bangladeshi clothing industry that supplies western fast-fashion brands. Or even the designer goods sector: “The factory worker just thinks, all I’m making is a shoe. They don’t know their shoe is being sold for $3,000.” Sign up to Bookmarks Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s. Literary delights delivered direct you after newsletter promotion There is a little optimism. Murgia – a former Wired writer – is alive to the potential of AI to improve health outcomes. And we meet people such as Hiba, whose family, refugees from Falluja, in Iraq, used their work as data labourers to fund a new life in Bulgaria. There are also cheering stories of how frustration at being exploited has led to gig economy workers quietly organising – even in China – to regain some of the autonomy they have sacrificed at “the altar of the algorithm”. But the bass note here is pessimistic. We are way past the techno-boosterism of the early 00s, and, for every government official wondering how AI can help them streamline health and welfare services, there are thousands of people asking whether it will allow them to continue making a living. Worse than that, as in the Chinese government’s facial recognition systems and pre-emptive detention lists in Xinjiang, it’s the story of a dystopia we are already living in.

"England ‘ready to win’ Euros, Leicester launch legal action: football news – as it happened","Huge thanks for joining us today. Tune in later for MBM coverage of the Netherlands v Scotland (7.45pm GMT kick-off). Here’s some reading to catch you up with some of today’s news lines. Have a splendid weekend! Championship promotion hopefuls Ipswich have confirmed a “significant investment” of up to £105m from US-based private equity firm Bright Path Sports Partners. The deal will see BPSP secure a 40% stake in the club. As a result, ORG, which manages funds for PSPRS (the Arizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System) remains the majority and controlling shareholder, retaining a 50% holding. Current Ipswich chief executive Mark Ashton will continue to manage the day-to-day running of the club, with new investors Bright Path Sports “providing capital and strategic thinking which will be of significant benefit”. ORG co-founder and principal Ed Schwartz said on the club’s website: “When we purchased Ipswich Town in 2021, we did so with the initial aim of restoring the club to the Championship and becoming competitive at this level, with the plan always including bringing a partner on board when the time was right. The club’s progress means we feel that time is now and we are excited to welcome Bright Path Sports.” PA Media Here’s our news story on the latest at Leicester. Leicester City have issued legal proceedings against the Premier League and English Football League after being dismayed by the action taken by the two organisations. Leicester are facing the potential double whammy of being docked points by both leagues owing to alleged financial breaches. The Foxes, who were relegated from the top flight last season, have been placed under a transfer embargo by the EFL for allegedly exceeding the upper loss threshold in their profitability and sustainability calculations relating to the 2023-24 season. Leicester say they dispute “the EFL’s entitlement to impose this constraint, which is both restrictive and premature”. The accounting period for 2023-24 ends on 30 June. Unless the club generate millions through sales before then, they are at risk of a points deduction from the EFL. Read more here … Bosnia and Herzegovina v Israel – off. Israel’s scheduled friendly in Sarajevo next Tuesday has been cancelled, with Uefa citing the “current security situation” as a reason. The two men’s teams had been due to meet after both were eliminated from the Euros qualifying playoffs. Israel lost to Iceland 4-1 in yesterday’s “home” game in Budapest, Hungary – it had to play in a neutral country because of security concerns during the current crisis in the Middle East. Associated Press Oh, but corner. With political leaders weighing in on the multicoloured St George’s Cross, several have pointed out the following examples of artistic license with flags that didn’t cause such a hoo-haa. Nike have said their piece on Collargate. Echoing the FA’s earlier words on the subject, they have issued their own statement on the apparently contentious England shirt. We have been a proud partner of the FA since 2012 and understand the significance and importance of the St George’s Cross and it was never our intention to offend, given what it means to England fans. Together with the FA, the intention was to celebrate the heroes of 1966 and their achievements. The trim on the cuffs takes its cues from the training gear worn by England’s 1966 heroes, with a gradient of blues and reds topped with purple. The same colours also feature an interpretation of the flag on the back of the collar.” More from Sven. My father was a Liverpool fan – he’s still a Liverpool fan. In 1979 I wrote to the club and asked if I could come to watch a training session. They replied, and invited me – I was honoured to go to the boot room. That was great, fantastic. It’s like a dream. I could never have dreamt about that. When I was a manager, I always dreamt about Liverpool – but it never happened. It was close once, there was some discussion once. But now? It happens! When they asked I thought it was a joke … but I said: ‘Of course!’” The squad he’ll oversee tomorrow is scheduled to feature an Anfield return for Fernando Torres, as well as Steven Gerrard, Jerzy Dudek, Sami Hyypia and Daniel Agger. Recent Guardian interviewee Jari Litmanen will join Ryan Babel in running out for both Liverpool and Ajax, having been on the books of both during their playing days. Today’s Football Daily is in. Featuring England v Brazil lead-up, Shirtgate and more. Heartwarming corner. Sven Gøran-Eriksson revealed in early January that he has pancreatic cancer, and was expected to only have a year to live. In the media rounds surrounding his announcement, he was asked about any regrets from his career, and dropped in that he’d have loved to have managed Liverpool. Calls were duly made, and last month it emerged that he would be coaching a legends side against Ajax. That game is tomorrow, in aid of the LFC Foundation (3pm GMT KO), and he’s currently talking to the media about it. A quick excerpt: “I’m very, very happy and I’m very, very lucky that I get to see people celebrate the things I have done while I’m still alive. I’m happy they’re telling me while I’m still alive … It makes my heart warm.” Go ‘ed, Sven. Leicester added that they are now under a transfer embargo. The club statement continues … The Club further notes that at 4pm today the EFL issued a public notification that LCFC has been placed under a registration embargo pursuant to its P&S rules. The EFL is aware that LCFC has disputed the EFL’s entitlement to impose this constraint, which is both restrictive and premature, with more than a quarter of the Club’s 2023/24 reporting period remaining. News just in, following Leicester’s charge over an alleged breach of profit and sustainability rules. The Foxes have now issued their own response, in which they state they are taking legal action against both the Premier League and the EFL. A club statement reads … LCFC has been compelled today to issue two urgent legal proceedings against the Premier League and the EFL. LCFC will be seeking that each of these proceedings is determined by an appropriate and fully independent legal panel. The Club is committed to ensure that any charges against it are properly and proportionately determined, in accordance with the applicable rules, by the right bodies, and at the right time. While LCFC would prefer the proceedings to be in public, so its supporters and the wider world can be informed about the important issues of football governance that will be considered, the relevant rules require that these proceedings are conducted confidentially, and LCFC will therefore not be able to comment further about them at this stage. We reaffirm the Club’s position that we will continue to fight for the right of Leicester City and all clubs to pursue their ambitions, particularly where these have been reasonably and fairly established through sustained sporting achievement.

Someone named after my post-shift role today, Stuart Fryer (I’m plotting egg and chips later), is weighing in sagely on Shirtgate. “Rishi somewhat surprised me with his rather unconventional (and itchy) preference for the ‘original England shirt’ [see 11.45am] …” Check out The True 1870s Original here. Taylor’s United counterpart, Marc Skinner, has no plans to roll over. Though 12 points off the top, he backs his side to upset the form table. “We’ve got to chase and that’s what we’re here to do,” Skinner said. “We’ve got to go to the Etihad, a very difficult place, against a very difficult team, and we’ve got to go and try to win a game of football. Not many teams (beat City), and that’s what we’ve got to break. We’ve done it before and that’s what we’ll aim to do again.” More lead-up to tomorrow’s Manchester derby in the WSL. City’s manager, Gareth Taylor, reckons it could be the biggest yet in the women’s game. His side are level on points with Chelsea at the top, while United are fourth, but with Liverpool breathing down their necks. Asked if the stakes were at their highest for the cross-city clash, Taylor said: “It would be hard to deny that. For us certainly the games are really important now but, whether it’s United this week, Liverpool next week, West Ham after that, Bristol City away – those games are super-important as well. The margin for error is really tight and any dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. “Hopefully we can get a really good crowd in, and I’m sure we will do. We’re looking at trying to capture the imaginations of as many young people as we possibly can. I’m sure the support’s going to be there tomorrow and they’re going to be right behind us.” Wimbledon and MK Dons have been fined a total of £10,500 and Harry Pell £1,000 with a one-match ban after an ill-tempered League Two clash between the clubs. The two clubs admitted failing to control the behaviour of their players after a mass brawl following the final whistle in the home side’s 1-0 win at the Cherry Red Records Stadium on 2 March, and have received with £8,000 and £2,500 sanctions respectively. Pell, an unused Wimbledon substitute in the game, admitted misconduct after appearing to kick balls towards MK Dons fans during the warm-up. A statement on the Football Association’s website said: “AFC Wimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons have been fined £8,000 and £2,500 respectively for their mass confrontation. While admitting the charge levelled at them, Wimbledon have appealed against the penalty. A statement on the club’s official website said: “AFC Wimbledon have been fined £8,000 for a breach of FA Rule E20: mass confrontation during our match on 2 March 2024. Whilst we have accepted the charge, we have submitted an appeal regarding the level of the sanction.” Trouble flared at the end of the game after Ronan Curtis’ last-gasp strike had secured victory for AFC Wimbledon, the club set up as Wimbledon FC prepared to move to Milton Keynes and become MK Dons. PA Media Let’s be clear, however … Adidas didn’t always get it right. Here’s Bernd Schneider in a 2002 World Cup qualifying playoff against Ukraine, looking like they’ve used tracky pant legs as sleeves … Many thanks Yara, good day, all. I’m still trying to process it’ll be like to live in a world where the German kit doesn’t have three stripes on it – it’s been a while … That is all from me for today. Stuart Goodwin is here to take you through to the end of the day. Thank you for all your emails and enjoy your weekend! The DFB announced that Germany’s association with Adidas will end and the national teams’ new kit will be supplied by Nike from 2027 until at least 2034. The German national team have worn the distinctive three-striped logo of Adidas since 1950. The brand was founded in a town near Nuremberg the year before. The German economy minister Robert Habeck told local news agency Dpa that he “could hardly imagine the German kit without the three stripes”, calling it “a piece of German identity”. The Bavarian premier Markus Soeder said: “The success story began in 1954 with the unforgettable World Cup victory, which gave our country self-confidence again. That’s why it’s wrong, a shame and also incomprehensible that this story should end now.” He added German football should not be “a pawn in international corporate battles”. The DFB said that Nike had made “the best financial offer” and also committed to supporting “amateur and grassroots sport”. Some Friday afternoon listening for you.  On yesterday’s Football Weekly Extra, Max Rushden was joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Liew and Ben Fisher to discuss Manchester United’s Kobbie Mainoo call up to the national team and whether he might be the answer to give Gareth Southgate’s midfield balance.

A great night in Warsaw ended in a bad one for me! Best of luck in the final everyone! Let’s go Polska! 1 more 🇵🇱 pic.twitter.com/lEugGzs4rj Some more emails on kitgate and other games this weekend! Jonathan writes: The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said that he “prefers the original England shirt”. What on earth does that even mean?? I do wish journalists would challenge such opportunistic shit-stirring nonsense. Starmer isn’t much better on this. I bet if asked, Sunak would say his favourite Beatles album is The Best of The Beatles. And Thomas is hopeful: Good to see Derby get a mention – in the company of Man City even! On a trip home last weekend (from the US) I watched them play promotion rivals Bolton. Bolton were by far the better team but Derby got the 1-0 win with massive support from a sold out 32,000+ crowd. Derby play Northampton tomorrow with a chance to extend their lead over Bolton to seven points and close to within two of Portsmouth. Given that Bolton still have to play Portsmouth and none of Derby’s remaining fixtures are against any of the top 8, things are looking hopeful for a return to the Championship. And Ben puts it succinctly: Hi Yara. The thing I find most tiresome about all this shirt chat (and that is a heavily contested category) is that all the usual rent-a-gobs who will be piping up about this will not also be banging the drum about Fifa’s hands off approach to those poor souls who will be building their stadiums. They will remain weirdly silent about the news just published in this blog about the FA essentially ignoring evidence about concussions and brain injury. They will somehow keep their cool about the horrible use of racism or tragedy chanting (a deplorable practice but now so common it has shorthand name) or the abandonment of promising young players by big teams. There are a million issues in football that are far more pressing and worthwhile of political intervention, yet as with everything with our current political status quo, the best we can hope for is some culture wars ping-pong on the deck of the Titanic. Grim reading that but very well said. Harvey Elliott pressed his claims for a late run into England’s Euro 2024 squad with two goals in the under-21s’ 5-1 victory over Azerbaijan. The 20-year-old Liverpool midfielder took his tally to seven goals in six matches and is now the leading scorer across the whole of this Under-21 Euros qualifying campaign. Elliott will hope to catch Gareth Southgate’s eye again at home to Luxembourg in Bolton on Tuesday as he looks to follow the Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in breaking into the senior setup. Chelsea’s Noni Madueke scored his fourth of the campaign as the visitors pressed home their dominance with two goals inside five first-half minutes, with Aston Villa’s Jaden Philogene and Elliott scoring after the break before the debutant Archie Gray scored the fifth in the 88th minute. It means the reigning European champions are the tournament’s leading goalscorers with 25 and they drew level on points with Group F leaders Ukraine, who head to Baku on Tuesday. PA Media The Football Association have responded to the backlash surrounding the new England kit and has defended the multicoloured St George’s Cross, saying it was part of a tribute to the team that won the World Cup in 1966. An FA spokesperson said: The new England 2024 Home kit has a number of design elements which were meant as a tribute to the 1966 World Cup winning team. The coloured trim on the cuffs is inspired by the training gear worn by England’s 1966 heroes, and the same colours also feature on the design on the back of the collar. It is not the first time that different coloured St George’s cross-inspired designs have been used on England shirts. We are very proud of the red and white St George’s cross – the England flag. We understand what it means to our fans, and how it unites and inspires, and it will be displayed prominently at Wembley tomorrow – as it always is – when England play Brazil.” Read the full story here. More thoughts on the England shirt drama. Adam writes: Hi Yara. Ireland fan here. Kit designers have typically avoided modifying national symbols (crosses, dragons, harps, etc.) and played loose and fast with the exact colours (see Ireland World Cup kit). The expanded colour scheme on the cross is (IMHO) kind of nice and reminiscent of highlights from NHS branding. Fifty bonus politics points to the first party to U-turn and embrace the colour scheme as patriotic. I actually thought it was an NHS tribute when I first saw the kit. And I do find the politics around it a bit tiresome. Especially given that this is not the first time the kits have donned non-traditional St George’s Cross. Gianpiero is a happy Welsh fan: Great win last night … Makes you forget about the rugby debacle …. On to Poland … Who knows??!!! CYMRU AM BYTH!!! And Lisa hopes for more from Gareth Southgate tomorrow: Hello Yara. I did not know that the Brazil team was so depleted going into tomorrow. I pray that means we get to see a more adventurous lineup from Gareth. Would love to see some of the young lads go toe-to-toe with BRAZIL! Harry Maguire says England have players who can produce in big moments and the squad is ready to win the Euros in Germany this summer. I feel that as a group, we’re ready to win. If you are to win the Euros, you are probably going to have to win a penalty shootout. Tournament football is built on big moments. The quarter-final against France at the 2022 World Cup could have gone either way but it went to them. We have the players to produce the big moments. We have to be mentally prepared so that in this tournament, we make these moments ours. Maguire also spoke about the criticism for his performances last year and claimed that playing for England as a Manchester United player brings added scrutiny. I think that different clubs have different scrutiny on players. I think every player who’s played for United and the country has come to a time when they’ve played for the country and people haven’t been happy. It’s part and parcel of football and playing for such a historic club. I wouldn’t change it for the world. The Football Association “was always fully aware” of the risk of concussion and brain injury to players as early as the 1980s but failed to take steps to improve safety, the high court has been told. Lawyers representing several former footballers and their families have said in court documents that minutes from an FA committee meeting in 1983 “indicate” that it knew of the risk posed by head injuries “but failed to take action to reduce the risk of players to the lowest reasonable level”. Ten former professional footballers – and the families of a further seven who have died – are suing the FA, the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the English Football League (EFL) and the sport’s law-making body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Read the full story below. Any thoughts, musings, questions, complaints or epiphanies on how your team will fare this weekend? Whether it is England, Wales, Manchester City, Derby, Crewe or Dundee United, send me an email. How have Brazil fared in this post-Tite era? Not great. They’re winless in their last four games, all World Cup qualifiers, having drawn with Venezuela before registering back-to-back-to-back losses against Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina. These upcoming friendlies will be massive to boost some morale ahead of the Copa América this summer. Dorival Júnior is certainly excited about the match at Wembley and is keen to get the good vibes back to Brazil again. Read our interview here where he talks World Cup, England and his best Brazil team of all time. Thanks Luke and hello all! Happy Friday! We know quite a bit about how England will be shaping up in tomorrow’s friendly, but what about Brazil? Dorival Júnior has a depleted squad to choose from as he prepares to name the very first lineup of his tenure. The Seleção are without (deep breath) Neymar, Marquinhos, Éder Militão and Casemiro, Alisson, Ederson, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Magalhães. (And exhale). Raphinha, Rodrygo, Vinícius Júnior and Richarlison are expected to start but for fans at Wembley, there will certainly be some new faces on display. With both mainstay keepers out, one of three uncapped goalkeepers will be making their first team debut: Leo Jardim, Bento or Rafael. Sávio, the 19-year-old wonderkid, who is heavily linked with Manchester City may also make an appearance. That’s the lot from me. Yara El-Shaboury is here to guide you through the next bit. It was a burst that proved the catalyst for Wales’s resounding 4-1 win over Finland, another absorbing night under the lights in Cardiff. With a couple of minutes gone, Harry Wilson received the ball on the left flank, about 30 yards from goal, and punched a pass into Brennan Johnson with the outside of his left foot. Seeking a one-two, Wilson charged past five blue shirts, picked up the baton on the perimeter of the box then beat another in Matti Peltola before getting a shot away. It was an arced run that quickened the pulse and subsequently soothed the inevitable anxieties in the stands. Say what you like about the new England football kit, it’s definitely not as bad as Nike’s effort for the Rugby World Cup back in 2007, is it? Saturday’s Manchester derby in the WSL could see City hit the top of the table. Will Unwin reports: Given the supposed furore about the England kit, Gareth Southgate’s answer to the inevitable question from the media later today will be interesting. Commercial imperatives (the fact they’ve already manufactured the kit, that is) will ensure Nike won’t be backing down any time soon. It follows that a suitably approving line has to be found regarding the design.",2024-03-22T17:39:18Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/mar/22/england-brazil-shirt-row-wales-euro-2024-playoff-final-football-news-live,The Guardian
North Korea cancels World Cup qualifier against Japan,"North Korea has abruptly cancelled its 2026 World Cup qualifying match with Japan next week, leaving organisers frantically searching for an alternative venue. North Korea reportedly decided it would no longer host the match, which had been scheduled for next Tuesday at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang, a day before the teams met in Tokyo on Thursday in the first of their two Asian qualifying Group B qualifiers. Minutes after that game, which Japan won 1-0, Kozo Tashima, the president of the Japan Football Association, told reporters that the return match in the North Korean capital would not go ahead. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said the match had been called off due to “unforeseen circumstances”. “The decision, taken in consultation with Fifa and relevant stakeholders, comes after the AFC was informed on 20 March by the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] Football Association of the need to move the match to a neutral venue due to unavoidable circumstances,” it said in a statement on Friday. The AFC did not give a reason for the cancellation and said it would be left to the relevant Fifa committees to decide on the fixture’s future. The Nikkei Asia website said the match had been moved to a yet unannounced neutral venue, while no date has been given for the fixture. The Kyodo news agency cited unspecified North Korean media reports about a “malignant infectious disease” in Japan, thought to be a reference to a potentially deadly form of group A streptococcal disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Experts in Japan have said cases of STSS will continue to spread, while officials are struggling to identify the cause. The number of cases in 2024 is expected to exceed last year’s record number after the presence of highly virulent and infectious strains were confirmed in Japan. Japan’s players and staff had planned to arrive in Pyongyang on Monday after training in Beijing, media reports said. Last month, a qualifying match for the Paris Olympics between the Japanese and North Korean women’s teams was moved from Pyongyang to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at the last minute after Japanese football authorities cited difficulties in travelling to North Korea, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Japan. The return leg of the men’s World Cup qualifier would have been the first international sports event to be held in North Korea since before the coronavirus pandemic. The regime responded to the outbreak by sealing its borders and banning foreign tourists. North Korea last hosted a men’s soccer international in Pyongyang in 2019 during the qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup. The country later pulled out of that competition, citing health concerns related to the pandemic. North Korea is also scheduled to host World Cup qualifiers against Group B’s other two teams, Syria and Myanmar, in June.",2024-03-22T11:44:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/north-korea-cancels-world-cup-qualifier-against-japan,The Guardian
"Weather tracker: Tornadoes hit central US, killing three","Last week, central parts of the US experienced a severe outbreak of tornadoes with more than two dozen forming across the states of Ohio and Indiana, resulting in at least three deaths and multiple injuries. A number of intense supercell thunderstorms travelled eastwards across central Indiana late in the afternoon and evening of 14 March, from which tornadoes formed. Many of these were weak with estimated maximum wind speeds of 65-85mph – the requirement to be categorised as an EF-0 tornado. A few were stronger, however. One initially damaged nearly half of the buildings in the small town of Selma, Indiana, before strengthening into an EF-3 tornado in Winchester. At the tornado’s peak, wind speeds of 155-165mph were estimated, with homes severely damaged and trees uprooted. The intensity then gradually decreased before it crossed into Ohio, although not without some further damage. Earlier this week, an area of low pressure propagated eastwards across Japan in conjunction with higher pressure over North and South Korea to the west, which allowed for a flow of very cold, northerly air to sink southwards across the Sea of Japan. Subsequently, snow fell widely across north-western Japan on Wednesday night. There was snow across low-lying areas, including in the city of Hikone, in the Shiga prefecture, with slight accumulations decorating the city with 2cm measured overnight. Farther inland, areas such as Nagano recorded 6cm by 6am, while there were higher accumulations in mountainous areas, with Kusatsu, within the Gunma prefecture, recording 40cm of snow within a 12-hour period by 7am on Thursday morning – breaking the record for the heaviest snowfall in March. Meanwhile, South Sudan became the next African country to witness record scorching temperatures as the heatwave is well under way, with air temperatures of 41C being recorded in the capital, Juba, on Tuesday. Little to no change is expected over the upcoming weeks with temperatures expected to peak into the low- to-mid-40s celsius every day; temperatures that are not uncommon during the summer months but rather exceptional at this time of year.",2024-03-22T11:05:58Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/22/weather-tracker-tornadoes-hit-central-us-killing-three,The Guardian
The Ohtani interpreter scandal reveals the grubby underbelly of sports betting,"This is Major League Baseball’s worst nightmare. The face of the league, its one, true international star, who this past offseason joined one of its biggest teams on a $700m contract, is associated with allegations around an illegal sports betting operation. The story so far: the Los Angeles Dodgers fired Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, the team’s two-way phenom, on Wednesday after an investigation revealed $4.5m in wire transfers sent from Ohtani’s bank account to a California betting organization that is now under federal investigation. Mizuhara had initially sat for an interview with ESPN, saying that Ohtani had paid the money to cover his interpreter’s gambling debts. After 24 hours, though, Ohtani’s representatives switched course, saying Mizuhara had been guilty of “massive theft,” and that the matter has been turned over to the authorities. ESPN reports that two wire transfers sent in September and October totaling $1m show Ohtani’s name. Gambling is legal in most US states, but not in California. So far, no charges have been filed in the ongoing investigation into the California book. Mizuhara says Ohtani did not place any bets himself, and the Dodgers star is not subject to any criminal or MLB investigation. Earlier on Wednesday, before the firing was announced, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred had been in attendance at the Seoul Series, two games in South Korea to mark the start of the new season. Manfred trumpeted the league’s commercial growth and its international development – there was a passing nod to the Oakland Athletics moving to Las Vegas, less than a decade removed from the stigma of gambling keeping all of the major US professional sports leagues away from The Strip. Less than 24 hours later, those three pillars of the Manfred legacy had combined and combusted. There are many unknowns to this story: how did Mizuhara have access to Ohtani’s account? How did he gain a $4.5m line of credit with bookmakers? What will the fallout be for Ohtani, one of the most famous people in Japan and one of the few MLB players familiar to non-baseball fans? What we do know, is that this is a terrible look for MLB which, like all US professional sports leagues, has rushed to embrace legal gambling. While Mizuhara’s problems stemmed from bets with an illegal bookmaker, this week’s fiasco is centered around a man with a clear gambling problem at the same time that MLB is embracing legal betting. Last year, MLB announced a partnership with FanDuel that will “bring fans’ viewing and wagering experiences closer than ever before.” Integrated, real-time gambling is coming to a sports streaming service near you soon. It’s not just MLB: on Tuesday, the NBA announced it would integrate real-time wagering into its streaming service, NBA League Pass. With the click of a remote, you wager on who grabs the next rebound, who misses the next free throw or who will win the third quarter. Needless to say, there are worrying signs that gambling addiction in the US is on the rise. “Calls to gambling helplines in most states in America are up, by sheer numbers,” Timothy Fong, co-director of the gambling studies program at UCLA, told the Guardian in December. He added that “more and more younger clients” – aged 25 and under – are seeking treatment. Around one in five (19%) adult Americans placed bets in 2022, according to research by Pew. Six percent of those placed bets on gambling apps – and 53% of those bets are placed in-game, according to CRG Global. Betting in-game juices viewership figures, and keeps those viewers hanging around for longer, allowing leagues to negotiate stronger TV rights deals, the backbone of any league’s riches. No league has embraced the in-game market more than MLB. Given baseball’s stop-start nature and the volume of MLB games – 2,430 in the regular season compared to the NFL’s 272 – there are more bets to be placed and just enough time between pitches to click an app before a user can think through the consequences. For many Americans, betting has become a daily ritual – and no sport feeds that dopamine rush as intensely as baseball. Broadcasts these days do not merely tease gambling; it’s omnipresent. You’re not there to watch the sport, to see who wins, you’re there to track your app, monitor your daily fantasy lineup and play catchup if your early innings bets have turned sour. Local broadcasts channeled through cable affiliates are drenched in gambling talk. There are lineup cards in partnership with FanDuel. Pitching matchups presented by BetMGM. A sport ostensibly governed and run by data wonks is not trying to deliver information to its audience; it’s trying to coerce viewers to part with their money, and MLB doesn’t seem inclined to stop any of it. Whereas leagues like the Premier League, based in England, have taken steps to curb the visualization of gambling, in baseball it’s ever-present. Fears over the league’s long-term commercial viability – with an ageing fanbase and collapsing regional broadcasters – has driven the game to clutch gambling as a life preserver. And, in economic terms, it’s worked. As baseball has become increasingly beholden to the gambling barons, interest in baseball has risen among younger demographics. The idea is basic: Take a sport tailor-made for in-game betting, place access to games and sportsbooks in the hands of young people through smartphones, and watch your ratings and revenue soar. It doesn’t appear to matter that one out of 10 US college students is a pathological gambler, according to an analysis from the University of Buffalo. For those at the ballpark, in-play betting is still viable: beyond the apps, seven MLB stadiums have a licensed sportsbook or sportsbook lounge. The sport no longer invites you to wager. It doesn’t just expect it. It’s a dictum: if you’re following along, you better have some juice on the outcome. It’s no wonder, then, that given the landscape, baseball would reach this day. One of the most famous events in the game’s history is based around a game-fixing scandal. More recently, in the legal gambling era, we’ve seen cockamamy schemes from Iowa baseball players and Brad Bohannon, the former Alabama college baseball coach, to try to cheat the system and the game. When you invite in the gambling vultures, few sports are so ripe for the danger of addiction, corruption and wrongdoing than baseball.",2024-03-22T09:00:33Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/22/mlb-embraced-betting-now-its-smeared-with-gamblings-grubby-underbelly,The Guardian
"Putin is a dictator and a tyrant, but other forces sustain him – and the west needs to understand them | Simon Jenkins","The west’s derisive reporting of Vladimir Putin’s election victory this week was a mark of his success. It was described as an abuse of democracy, “rigged”, “fixed” and “a sham”. The other candidates were shadows, while Putin’s true opponents were imprisoned, exiled or dead. According to this narrative, the 87% who voted for him were mere victims of coercion, the queues of silent protesters were the stars. Putin’s vote had nothing to do with democracy. It was a rerun of his 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, a global dressing-up, a rallying of support. As he celebrated his win to an adoring crowd in Red Square on Monday, we saw Putin as the new Ivan the Terrible against a backdrop of Ivan’s St Basil’s cathedral. He even made an offhand quip about his murdered rival Navalny. The image was of absolute power smilingly defying the enemy. Two years ago, he was supposedly crippled by western sanctions. We don’t hear that now. I sometimes think what fun it would be to spend a month as the London correspondent for a totalitarian state newspaper. The evidence of relentless failures by the British government would fuel my daily contrasts with the order and stability back home. I would ponder when these bickering politicians and their corrupt donors would fade to nothing. I would report on the excluded populists – the Johnsons, Andersons, Farages and Galloways – waiting in the wings to pounce, while Rishi Sunak twists and turns frantically to avoid an election. How we describe other countries matters when our concern is not how it seems to them, but how it feels to us. Almost half a century of George Kennan’s policy of containment and cohabitation with communism has given way to a shrill new agenda. Not just Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Syria, but states across Asia and Africa are regularly castigated as tyrannical, terrorist or genocidal. They are made victims of economic aggression through sanctions, distorting global trade and impoverishing millions. There is no evidence this castigation has advanced the cause of democracy an inch – quite the opposite. One survey suggests the number of democracies has declined since 2015. Political bookshelves heave with predictions of democracy’s decay and death. Most alarming was last year’s polling from Open Society Foundations. Surveying nations across the globe, it found that only 57% of 18 to 35s regarded democracy as their preferred form of government, against more than 70% for those over 56. Each successive younger generation has a lower respect for democracy. More than a third of the world’s under-35s would today support some sort of “military rule”, by a “strong leader” who did not hold elections or consult a parliament. When I asked a Russia expert what he thought would be the true tally of electoral support for Putin’s dictatorship, his view squared with this survey. He suggested it would be about 60%, though lower in Moscow and St Petersburg. This sounded much like my visits to Moscow in the post-communist 1990s. Russians would concede the virtues of western democracy, but they pleaded the more urgent need for order, security and prosperity. To vote for Putin, you did not need to support his regime or his war with Ukraine. You might well be content with the one thing he promises: security and a patriotic response to western abuse. Nato’s escalation of its logistical aid to Ukraine into an all-out economic war on the Russian people enabled Putin to construct an anti-west coalition. It now extends from China and India to embrace a stage army of authoritarians across the globe. This economic war has clearly been counter-productive. The Economist reports this week that the sanctions have in fact “juiced the [Russian] economy”. Russian GDP growth of approximately 3 % in real terms last year outstripped Britain’s. Western policy is actively helping Putin retain power. As the historian of modern Russia Mark Galeotti points out, Putin’s defiance of his western critics has entrenched his “shabby police state”, possibly for his lifetime. We can hurl abuse at him, as we can at Xi, Modi and the rest. It may make us feel better. And perhaps we should, not least on moral grounds: these are not regimes we would cast as admirable. But let’s be realistic. There is not the slightest evidence that in doing so we are making the world a safer place for democracy; probably the reverse.

Australia 2-0 Lebanon: World Cup qualifier – as it happened,"Here is Joey Lynch’s report from CommBank Stadium in Parramatta: Australia has now played three games on the road to the 2026 Fifa World Cup. They have emerged triumphant in all three games and after their 2-0 win over Lebanon, they already have one foot in the third round of Asian World Cup qualifying. But the victory over the Cedars in Sydney’s West has extracted a significant price on Graham Arnold’s side. Thank you for joining me tonight. We’ll be back here to do it all again on Tuesday, this time for a Lebanon “home” fixture from Canberra. I’ll see you then. It devolved into a tricky game to appraise. For the first half-hour or so Australia looked well drilled, urgent, and worth their 1-0 lead. But as the game wore on the Socceroos lost their rhythm and Lebanon grew in belief. By the end the visitors were the more likely side to score. Despite bossing possession the Socceroos created few clear chances and there was no shortage of fortune about both goals. Adam Taggart will be disappointed with his night’s work after being repeatedly caught offside and failing to execute an assured first touch as shooting opportunities unfolded. Ajdin Hrustic shone amongst the chaos, but his free roaming role drifting in from the right played its own part in the unstructured second half, one in which Keanu Baccus was increasingly isolated at the base of midfield. Earlier injuries to Riley McGree and Jordy Bos disrupted what was already an experimental line-up. “We can do better,” bemoans Connor Metcalfe immediately after the final whistle. Adding, “sloppy… individual errors… it’s not easy switching between systems.” Much to Australia’s relief, the referee blows the whistle for full-time. Two-nil, three points, three wins from three in this stage of qualifying, but that was not a convincing performance from the Socceroos. 90+5 mins: Darwich takes it – and it draws a tremendous diving save from Ryan away to his left. Lebanon keep the ball alive and the cross is hurled over for Lajud to glance wide! 90+4 mins: Handball against Hrustic right on the edge of Australia’s box. Lebanon with a decent set-piece opportunity to snatch a consolation goal. 90+3 mins: Australia’s inability to retain possession in midfield has become a chronic issue late in the game. Better opposition would have punished them for it by now. 90+2 mins: Just five minutes of stoppage time for Australia to navigate and they can look ahead to Tuesday’s return fixture. 90+1 mins: The corner is dangerous but Matar does well to punch the second effort clear. Baccus keeps the opportunity alive and eventually Metcalfe drills a sweetly struck effort straight at the keeper. 90 mins: Irvine has a clear sight of goal running with the ball into the penalty area, but his sidef-ooted effort is deflected wide of the post and out for a corner. 88 mins: Iredale has a decent shot from range that’s saved comfortably. Australia haven’t had too many efforts on goal tonight. 85 mins: Superb lone-striker play from Duke, leaping to win the clearance then finding Metcalfe with the second ball, but the cross is poor and cleared easily. Lebanon are playing with belief now. Probably too little too late, but they’re making Australia scrap in these closing stages. 83 mins: That was a major scare for Australia who have lost control of the physical and tactical battle in the past 10-15 minutes. Lebanon’s substitutes have made an impact and the stop-start nature of the game has robbed the Socceroos of any fluidity. 81 mins: Australia break out of defence but Irvine doesn’t free Hrustic bursting through the middle. Instead the skipper retains possession and the ball is rolled across the Socceroos defence… but Burgess takes his eye off the ball and red shirts swarm around him. Lebanon have numbers, and fashion a chance for Lajud – who curls an effort against the inside of Ryan’s near post! So so close for the visitors. 79 mins: Decent effort from Lebanon who work the ball out of congestion on the right for Lajud to have a lash on goal but his swipe skews well wide. Omar Bugiel and Ali Sisi replaced by Karim Darwiche and Nader Matar 78 mins: Now Baccus is booked for legging Haidar. The opening goalscorer will now be suspended for Tuesday’s clash. This match is no longer a thing of beauty. 76 mins: Good effort for a school night. 2️⃣7️⃣,0️⃣2️⃣6️⃣ at @commbankstadium tonight for #AUSvLBN 🏟️#Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/7Jgef1z0zI 74 mins: Gorgeous outside-of-the-left-boot flick from Hrustic into the right channel, but Duke is offside in pursuit of it. There is a touch of class in the playmaker that nobody else in Australia is currently capable of. If the Socceroos are to progress against better opponents Arnold is going to need to figure out a formation that allows Hrustic to flourish. 73 mins: Ryan finds Atkinson with an early throw but the fullback eschews the angled run of Duke in favour of a long hopeful whack to the isolated Metcalfe. Lebanon clear. 71 mins: News from ptichiside is that Jordy Bos’s knee injury doesn’t appear too serious, which is excellent to hear. Meanwhile the scrappiness continues out on the field. 69 mins: Australia have lost those patterns of play that served them so well in the first half. The game is becoming increasingly fractured and reliant on individual moments. 67 mins: It’s subs o’clock in Parramatta with both sides making changes. The Socceroos elect to replace their forward line with Duke and Iredale coming on for Yengi and Taggart. While for Lebanon Hassan Maatouk is replaced by Daniel Lajud. 66' | Substitution: Our final changes.⬆️ Duke, Iredale⬇️ Yengi, Taggart🇦🇺 2-0 🇱🇧#AUSvLBN #Socceroos #DifferentBreed 65 mins: Australia finally find some timing and isolate Metcalfe one-on-one on the left. He goes outside his marker but then overhits his cross. 64 mins: It’s all got a bit scrappy again with neither side able to assert any control in midfield. 61 mins: Well, Martin, it very nearly did! From a very narrow angle Ryan is forced into his first acrobatic save of the night, forcing the ball clear at full stretch from a fierce Tneich drive. Nathaniel Atkinson is then booked for making slight contact in midfield. Lebanon’s propensity to go to ground is not endearing them to me. 60 mins: Cometh the hour, cometh the man. That man is Martin Turnbull: “Not a bad game to date. Shame about Bos. Lebanon are an extremely limited side. Hope that doesn’t come back to bite me!” 58 mins: As if scripted, another example materialises when Hrustic conjures an impudent flick on the edge of the box to unpick the Lebanon defence, but Taggart is not alert to the moment and his touch evades him yet again. 56 mins: Lebanon will have to come out of their shell now and allow Australia more room to play. Hrustic anticipates just that and picks out the running Taggart (onside this time) but the striker’s layoff to Atkinson misses its target. Taggart has got through a power of work tonight but his touch has been found wanting often. And from the resulting corner Australia go 2-0 up! The corner to the near post comes off a bundle of bodies and drops to the feet of Kye Rowles. He swings a left boot at the ball like a novice golfer might a driver, and he makes solid enough connection to slice the ball awkwardly in off the near post. 53 mins: Haidar wins a free-kick on halfway on the left but instead of turning it into an attack the ball is played all the way back to the goalkeeper. The Socceroos pounce, force the turnover and Irvine has a snapshot deflected into the side-netting. 51 mins: Australia have dominated possession since the break, calmly keeping the ball out of Lebanon’s reach. For the time being the Cedars are happy to sit in and hold their shape. 49 mins: … once more for luck! Hrustic to Taggart through on the goal but there’s no end product because the forward didn’t bend his run enough before accepting possession. Three near identical incidents in a matter of seconds. 49 mins: … and again! Hrustic to Taggart, the crowd anticipates a shot but the flag is up for offside. 49 mins: Hrustic again, switching from touchline to touchline to open the play and find Metcalfe, then slipping Taggart through with a delightful pass only for the Perth Glory striker to be caught offside. 47 mins: Hrustic is quickly into the game, drifting in from the right and lofting a cross that almost reaches the poised Yengi. 46 mins: A change for Lebanon at the break with attacking midfielder Mohamad Haidar coming on for the more defensively minded Hasan Srour. The teams are back out in Parramatta ready for the second half. The Socceroos take a slender lead into the break. Their performance has been bright and energetic but they have created very little in front of goal for all their endeavour. The first-half headline may yet prove to be the injuries to McGree and Bos that forced both left-sided attackers off the field. 45+4 mins: Both sides fail to find their intended targets with crucial passes as the game suddenly opens up. It’s all become fractured towards the end of the half. 45+2 mins: Australia break swiftly and free Metcalfe on the left but he dwells on his cross and a red shirt flies across to deflect the ball behind. The corner leads to nothing. 45 mins: Sabra’s down again. He doesn’t need to be. 43 mins: Hrustic has actually entered on the right side of midfield with Metcalfe switching to the left. 42 mins: Australia call on their third left-sided attacker of the night with Ajdin Hrustic replacing Jordy Bos. Fingers crossed neither Bos nor McGree are badly injured. 40 mins: Chaaban goes down theatrically in the box, but there’s nothing doing. Then the follow-up shot needs saving low to his left by Ryan. Lebanon’s first look at goal for the night. Meanwhile, Bos is back down on the turf shaking his head. That knee injury looks to be forcing him off. 38 mins: … not just into the fray but whipping in a gorgeous left-footed cross from the touchline that is begging to be thumped home by either striker, only for it to evade both Taggart and Yengi. 36 mins: But Arnie will not be happy to see another left-sided attacker down injured. Bos landed heavily in a shoulder-to-shoulder clash in the left corner and at first it looked like he could have done himself a serious mischief, but he’s eventually back to his feet and into the fray.",2024-03-21T11:36:09Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/mar/21/australia-vs-lebanon-socceroos-world-cup-qualifier-live-updates-scores-results-lineups-start-time-commbank-stadium-sydney-parramatta,The Guardian
Translator for Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani’s fired after allegations of ‘massive theft’,"The interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, the biggest star in baseball and one of the most famous people in Japan, has been fired after lawyers for the player said there had been a “massive theft” from the slugger’s account. ESPN reported that several sources said Ippei Mizuhara had run up large debts to a Californian bookmaker. Initially a spokesperson for the player said Ohtani had transferred $4.5m to cover Mizuhara’s debts. But when ESPN asked further questions, the spokesperson backed away from their claim and said Ohtani’s lawyers would soon make a statement. “In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft, and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,” read the statement from Berk Brettler LLP on Wednesday. Mizuhara told ESPN on Wednesday he had been instructed not to comment on the matter but did not say where those instructions had come from. Sports betting is legal in most US states but is still outlawed in California, where Ohtani plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers. MLB players and staff are allowed to bet on sports other than baseball but are forbidden from gambling with illegal bookmakers. Any violation of the rules would leave players or staff subject to punishment from the MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred. There is no suggestion that Ohtani has ever gambled himself. Mizuhara had initially said on Tuesday that Ohtani had helped him cover the gambling debts and ESPN saw two documents containing payments of $500,000 in Ohtani’s name from September and October. ESPN reports the payments were made to an associate of Mathew Bowyer, whose bookmaking operation is under investigation by federal investigators. Bowyer’s attorney, Diane Bass, told ESPN: “Mr Bowyer never met or spoke with Shohei Ohtani.” Mizuhara said on Tuesday, before Wednesday’s developments, that Ohtani had nothing to do with the betting itself. “Obviously, he [Ohtani] wasn’t happy about [the debt] and said he would help me out to make sure I never do this again,” Mizuhara said. “He decided to pay it off for me. I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting. I want people to know I did not know this was illegal. I learned my lesson the hard way. I will never do sports betting ever again.” Mizuhara added that he had never bet on baseball. “I never bet on baseball,” Mizuhara said. “That’s 100%. I knew that rule ... We have a meeting about that in spring training.” Ohtani and Mizuhara are close friends beyond their working relationship. Mizuhara has been Ohtani’s translator since the star moved from Japan to play for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani joined the Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal. He made his Dodgers debut on Wednesday in a victory over the San Diego Padres in South Korea, and is hugely popular in Japan. ESPN said MLB is investigating the case. The Dodgers have yet to comment.",2024-03-20T22:55:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/20/mlb-star-shohei-ohtanis-translator-fired-after-allegations-of-massive-theft,The Guardian
Japan v North Korea World Cup qualifier resumes rivalry that extends beyond football,"A place at the next football World Cup is not all that is at stake when Japan and North Korea meet on Thursday for the first of two qualifying matches, in a resumption of one of the fiercest rivalries in international football. Despite the huge gap between the countries’ economies and the profiles of their domestic leagues, few expect the match at Tokyo’s national stadium to be a walkover for the Japanese, who are 18th in the Fifa rankings, 96 places above their opponents. Meetings between the two countries have always been about more than football. On one side, a former colonial power allied to Pyongyang’s arch-enemy, the US; on the other, a dictatorship that has sent ballistic missiles over Japan and abducted dozens of its citizens. Pundits expect the Samurai Blue to win in front of a highly partisan crowd, but they will be in unfamiliar, hostile territory five days later for the return leg at the 50,000-seat Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang. With a week to go before kick-off for that second match, it was not clear if North Korean supporters – mainly military and party elites – would be allowed to attend. Geopolitics is never far away when the two teams meet. The qualifiers for the 2026 tournament, co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, come soon after the North test-launched short-range ballistic missiles and the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, oversaw a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable rocket launchers designed to target Seoul. The country’s million-strong army, Kim said this week, should “prepare for war”. The visiting players, who were permitted to travel as an exception to sanctions barring North Koreans from entering Japan, will not be without support. Among the expected 68,000 crowd will be several thousand members of Japan’s 150,000-strong North Korean community, many of whom are descended from people forcibly brought to work in Japan during Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula. The 4,000 tickets for seats in the North Korean section of the stadium sold out immediately, while the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan – North Korea’s de facto embassy – urged ethnic minority zainichi Koreans with connections to the North to cheer for the visitors. Risa Ho, an ethnic North Korean living in Tokyo, said she would be supporting the visitors on Thursday. “I love Japanese footballers and I usually support Japan, but not when they play North Korea,” said Ho, who will be in the crowd at the national stadium. “It’s complicated, and I feel a little bit conflicted, but when it comes to the national team I want to support North Korea,” added Ho, who predicted some frank exchanges between rival supporters on Thursday. “The political backdrop means these games always have an edge.” As for the result, Ho predicted a 2-1 win for Japan, but believed North Korea would still make the World Cup finals. “North Korea is putting a lot of effort into improving its sports teams, and that includes football,” she said, adding that Kim, known for his love of NBA basketball, also followed football. North Korea have historically punched well above their weight in international football. At the 1966 World Cup in England, the unknown team stunned Italy with a 1-0 win in a decisive group match, only to be beaten 5-3 by Portugal in the quarter-final after leading 3-0. Their record against Japan suggests that the results of the two games are far from fait accompli for the Samurai Blue, who began their World Cup campaign with comfortable wins over Asian minnows Syria and Myanmar. In the two countries’ 20 meetings since 1975, the men’s senior teams have each won eight and drawn four. Previous fixtures between North Korea and Japan have occasionally seen the mutual animosity spill over on to the pitch. The Japan U-23’s 2-1 victory over the North at the Asian Games last October was marred when members of the losing team clashed with match officials and security staff. “I admit that our players were a little bit over-excited in the match, but that’s football,” North Korea’s coach, Sin Yong Nam, said afterwards. “But there are confrontations in football matches … I think our behaviour was acceptable.” When the countries’ women’s teams played each other in Tokyo last month, North Korean fans turned a section of the stadium into a blanket of red, with some waving flags urging their players to “protect the dignity of the republic” – a reference to North Korea’s official name the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Like other athletes from the secretive country, the players were confined to their accommodation, training ground and stadium, and banned from speaking to Japanese or South Koreans, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Contests between Korean and Japanese teams can summon mixed emotions among younger ethnic Koreans in Japan. “I was born and brought up in Japan, so to be honest, I knew the Japan players’ names and faces better than the DPRK players from seeing them on TV,” An Yong-hak, a former North Korean international, told Agence France-Presse this week. “But I am an ethnic Korean, and my name is An Yong-hak. I thought of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as my national team, and I always worked hard with that in mind.” As North Korea attempt to qualify for their first World Cup since 2010, An attempted to play down the historical and political tensions that have made this one of the qualifying rounds’ most anticipated matches. Recalling his team’s injury-time defeat against Japan in a World Cup qualifier in 2006, he held out hope that, whatever the result on Thursday, fair play will prevail. “After that game we all shook hands and waved to the Japanese fans,” An said. “It was a great game that went beyond the result, and I hope this time is the same.” Agencies contributed reporting",2024-03-20T15:30:39Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/20/japan-north-korea-rivalry-extends-beyond-football,The Guardian
‘Social media is like driving with no speed limits’: the US surgeon general fighting for youngsters’ happiness,"It was the hush that worried the US’s top doctor as he toured the country’s university campuses last year. Dr Vivek Murthy went to places including Duke, University of Texas and Arizona State, but so many youngsters were plugged into earphones and gazing into laptops and phones that it was incredibly quiet in the communal areas. Where was the loud chatter Murthy remembered from his college days? “Students said to me, ‘how are we supposed to start a conversation?’” the US surgeon general told the Guardian. “It’s just not the culture any more to talk to one another. It’s an indictment of the trends that we’ve seen.” Figures published on Wednesday reveal one possible impact of that screen obsession: for the first time since the data was first collected in 2012, 15- to 24-year-olds in North America say they are less happy than older generations. The gap is closing in western European nations and in March Murthy flew to London to further his campaign against falling levels of happiness, particularly among the young. He is also worried about youth wellbeing in Japan, South Korea and India. The replacement of person-to-person social connection, whether through clubs, sports teams, volunteering or faith groups, is a particular concern to the Yorkshire-born medic. Education, housing and transport initiatives that do not focus on improving wellbeing are also a worry. But perhaps the biggest problem in his opinion is the explosion of social media use, which has caused “extraordinary harms”. It is notable that Murthy is focusing so hard on this social issue. At a conference at the LSE in London on Monday, academics and researchers in the fast-developing field of wellbeing science gave him a standing ovation. There are clear physical impacts of misery for world leaders to consider. Social disconnection in the US has led to “a 29% increase in the risk of heart disease, a 32% increase in the risk of stroke and a 50% increase in the risk of dementia among older individuals,” he said. Last year, Murthy, who was first appointed to his role by Barack Obama and again by Joe Biden, issued a formal US-wide warning that social media presented “a profound risk of harm” to the mental health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. “We do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe” for them to use, it said. “I’m still waiting for companies to show us data that tells us that their platforms are actually safe,” he added. He compared tech companies to 20th-century car giants producing vehicles without seatbelts and airbags until legislation mandated it. “What’s happening in social media is the equivalent of having children in cars that have no safety features and driving on roads with no speed limits,” he said. “No traffic lights and no rules whatsoever. And we’re telling them: ‘you know what, do your best – figure out how to manage it.’ It is insane if you think about it.” The result is that parents feel “this whole thing [managing the impact of social media] has been dumped on their shoulders”. Murthy said that between 2000 and 2020 there has been a 70% decrease in the amount of in-person time young people in the US spent with their friends. Meanwhile, “our recent data is telling us that adolescents are spending on average 4.8 hours a day on social media … a third of adolescents are staying up till midnight or later on weeknights on their devices”. Last Sunday, he met with a group of young people in a park in west London and concluded their phones were feeding them a diet of “headlines that are constantly telling them that the world is broken, and that the future is bleak”. “And they said: you receive that again and again and again. You start to internalise that. You sort of lose a sense of hope.” He is interested, too, in how burgeoning social media use fuels “hustle culture” that teaches young people that they ought to build a “personal brand” and even an income stream alongside studying and growing up. “I ask [young people] what hustle culture is telling you success is,” he said. “They say some version of fame, followers and fortune. I have had too many young people say what they feel like they’ve really got to do right now is build their brand. And they don’t say that ironically.” He said social media companies should limit or eliminate “features that try to get kids to drive towards other people liking, reposting and commenting on their posts”, such as buttons and infinite scroll mechanisms that can be addictive, damage self-esteem and erode time available for other activities. “The platforms have the power to do that,” he said. Governments have been slow to install mandatory guardrails on social media platforms and should have done so 10 years ago, he said. “What has happened is a fundamental failure of governments to protect young people from the harmful effects of a new technology and it’s not new any more.” To counteract the trend, Murthy wants governments to start measuring their policies in terms of their impact on real world social connection. “Think about policies that carve up our cities and towns with highways and roadways and separate us from one another,” he said. “Think about the power of policy to actually put public transportation in place and bring people back together. Housing design can have a powerful impact on how people come together.” In 2021, the leader of the UK opposition, Keir Starmer, said a Labour government would weigh spending plans based on their effect on wellbeing in addition to national income. But for now he compares the status quo with social media to a doctor being allowed to run a hospital where floors are so slippery that people fall and break their hips, patients suffer blood clots because medicine is not being administered and become infected because dirty equipment is being used. His point is it would not happen. Protections are needed immediately, he said. “If you’ve got a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old, you don’t have three to five years to wait,” he said. “Our kids’ childhoods are happening right now. I worry that there isn’t enough of a sense of urgency in government.”",2024-03-20T00:01:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/20/vivek-murthy-us-surgeon-general-social-media-youth-happiness,The Guardian
Czech Republic to deliver thousands of extra artillery shells to Ukraine,"The Czech Republic says it is on the verge of delivering thousands of extra artillery shells to Ukraine, just weeks after it announced an initiative to source the much-needed supplies from outside the EU. Its foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said it had so far secured 300,000 shells and that the ammunition would provide a vital “few months’ breathing space” on the frontline. Sources added that the first deliveries would come before June. “We have a direct experience with 40 years of being a satellite of Moscow, being a country which was invaded in 1968 by Russian tanks to curb the Prague Spring,” said Lipavský, adding that his country could not stand by and watch Ukraine go without help. “No one really wants to bring back those [Soviet] times, and I have to say that the population is very sensitive to that.” Ukraine has said it is falling short of ammunition against Russia; the EU has said it expects to meet only 52% of a target set last year to deliver a million shells by March, and a bill to fund US military aid to Kyiv has been held up in Congress. Russia is ‘‘outshelling’’ Ukraine by a five-to-one ratio and Kyiv’s forces are gradually being pushed back on the battlefield. Last month Avdiivka, a frontline town, fell to the Russians after a four-month battle. Petr Pavel, the Czech president, announced the initiative at the Munich security conference in February, saying Prague had located 800,000 shells that could be obtained with funding from a consortium of western countries. The scheme works by European countries buying the shells from countries in Africa and Asia, such as South Korea, which are unwilling to supply them directly to Ukraine but happy to sell to a third party such as the Czech Republic. The munitions come from unused military stockpiles, but supplier nations are usually reluctant to be named. Czech sources said that the consortium had obtained serious pledges to supply 300,000 high-calibre artillery shells, with the first shipments being delivered no later than June. Nonbinding pledges for a further 200,000 had been made. Lipavský said the Czech Republic hope to deliver the shells “within months” to help “contain Russia’s imperialistic ambitions”, increasing speculation Ukraine could have boosted stocks from June. Lipavský said the Czechs used a combination of diplomatic and defence ministry channels to create state-to-state communications to tap supplies around the world to enable EU member states to find arms previously untapped in the war against Russia. The foreign minister said that 18 countries had committed to the initiative and they were close to raising the required funding to buy all 800,000 shells in an initiative that was partly a response the standoff in the US Congress, which is preventing the approval of a new $60bn military aid package. “I think that many European countries have realised how difficult the situation in Ukraine is,” a Czech source said. “At the same time, many European governments want to send a message to the US that we are seriously covering our share in order to encourage the US to do their share for the sake of defence of free world.” The Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, and Canada have publicly confirmed their involvement. On Monday night Sweden added its name, pledging €30m, and Canada’s defence minister on Tuesday disclosed it had donated C$40 (€27m). EU leaders are separately close to agreeing a €5bn fund for Ukraine. Insiders said there was a close working relationship on arms for Ukraine between the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, and his Danish and Dutch counterparts, Mette Frederiksen and Mark Rutte. Rutte has been nominated by the US, UK and Germany to become the next head of Nato. Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The three countries have so far raised €1.5bn for military supplies for Ukraine, including tanks, air aircraft systems and howitzers, and their willingness has persuaded other European nations to support them. “Ukraine has to be able to defend itself because it defends the whole Europe,” Lipavský said. “It is not [about] Ukraine losing; it is the whole western civilisation, the principles which are now at stake and which are being challenged by Russian imperialism.” He said the Czech initiative was “accelerated” two weeks after it was first announced at a summit in Paris attended by more than 20 countries. “President Macron has shown very strong leadership in recent months. I’m very happy for that […] Paris really put impetus into the whole thing,” Lipavský said. The Latvian prime minister, attending a EU summit of foreign ministers in Brussels, also said Macron’s leadership was important. Krišjānis Kariņš said Macron had inserted “strategic ambiguity” into the public discussion by suggesting troops from France had to be deployed Ukraine, which was important as a counter-narrative to undermine the Kremlin. “France sees the urgency we in the Baltics have had for the past two years. Russia will not stop, they can only be stopped. Ukraine is prepared to do the stopping but they need our assistance,” Karins added. A senior European official praised the Prague-led effort: “The Czech initiative has proven to be very very effective. We’ll be able to provide ammunition to Ukraine in the coming weeks and months. “Ukraine is in dire need of ammunition to defend itself against Russia attacks. We are very happy that there are so many countries are willing to contribute and join this initiative. I think it will really make a change in the battlefield,” he told the Guardian.",2024-03-19T18:13:07Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/19/czech-republic-to-deliver-thousands-of-extra-artillery-shells-to-ukraine,The Guardian
Shohei Ohtani: a Japanese baseball star so loved even Koreans flock to him,"The sport is American, the venue South Korean. But when the LA Dodgers and San Diego Padres open the Major League Baseball season with two games in Seoul this week, all eyes will be on a Japanese superstar: Shohei Ohtani. It says much about Ohtani’s singular appeal that South Korean baseball fans are as excited about his imminent presence in the batter’s box at Gocheok Sky Dome as his legions of admirers in Japan. The 29-year-old is widely considered to be one of the most talented players in baseball history – a once-in-a-century phenomenon who has been compared to another figure who starred as a pitcher and a slugger: Babe Ruth. After six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, in December Ohtani signed a deal with the Dodgers that will see him eventually earn $700m – the richest contract in North American sporting history. It is no exaggeration to say that “Shotime” – twice named the American League’s most valuable player – has achieved national hero status in his native Japan since he left the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters for the Angels in 2017, following a path laid out by his illustrious predecessors Hideo Nomo and Ichiro Suzuki. Ohtani has eclipsed his yakyū compatriots to become one of the most talked about baseball players in living memory. Not even the injury to his right elbow that will keep him off the pitcher’s mound this season could dampen the sense of anticipation when the Dodgers arrived in South Korea for a series of warmups before the MLB games on Wednesday and Thursday. Not usually given to heaping praise on athletes from their great sporting rival, Japan, South Korean sports fans make an exception for Ohtani, who has reciprocated with positive posts on his Instagram account and pronounced the South “one of my favourite countries”. “The atmosphere in Korean society has often made it difficult for us to openly say we like Japan,” said Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Hanyang University in Seoul. “I think Ohtani would perhaps be the first Japanese athlete who we can say we like. Maybe, some even consider him an honorary Korean citizen.” That was mirrored in a Korean-language post on X: “The country that Ohtani likes the most is South Korea. The Japanese who South Koreans like the most is Ohtani,” it said. The Japanese representation will not be confined to Ohtani, who will be joined by teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto – who will be making his MLB debut and is the most expensive pitcher in history – and, for the Padres, Yu Darvish and Yuki Matsui. Ohtani fever has intensified since he lead his country to victory in the last year’s World Baseball Classic, with Japan overcoming the defending champions, the US, in a 3-2 thriller. After signing his record-breaking contract with the Dodgers in December, Ohtani managed to turn an eye-popping financial reward into a positive verdict on his character, suggesting to the team’s management that he be paid most of the sum in annual increments starting in 2034 to enable them to invest in more players now. Off the field, too, he can do little wrong. A native of the north-eastern region of Japan devastated by the March 2011 triple disaster, Ohtani donated an undisclosed sum to the peninsula struck by a powerful earthquake on New Year’s Day. Last year he sent 60,000 baseball gloves to primary schools in Japan – enough for three gloves per school. Like Japanese expat athletes before him, Ohtani is pursued by an army of journalists whose reports fill the pages of sports tabloids and serious broadsheets alike. Column inches have been devoted to the latest on his elbow injury and Ohtani’s dog, Dekopin. Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion He is the public face of multiple companies, including Porsche, the sportswear maker Asics, Japan Airlines and Mitsubishi UFJ Bank. Katsuhiro Miyamoto, a professor at Kansai University, estimated that his economic impact had reached ¥50.4bn ($334m) by the end of last year, adding that it would rise to ¥64.3bn ($427m) this year if Ohtani, who was a free agent when Miyamoto’s report was published, moved to the Dodgers. “The economic impact of Ohtani’s success will be enormous,” he wrote, according to the Japan Times. “Sho fever” can sometimes reach bizarre proportions. Japanese TV cut into regular programming to report the “breaking news” of Ohtani’s surprise announcement that he had married, with his wife’s identity only made public – again to blanket media coverage – weeks later. After he became the first Japanese player to win the American League home-run title in 2023, newspapers handed out special editions and Japan Post issued commemorative stamps and postcards. Last summer, rice paddies in his hometown were transformed into a giant illustration of its famous son. The Dodgers arrived in Seoul at a rare moment of rapprochement between Japan and South Korea, whose conservative leaders have attempted to settle bitter disputes stemming from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula. Even so, few expected a Japanese athlete to enjoy these levels of adulation in South Korea, where hundreds of fans greeted the Dodgers at Incheon airport last week, shouting Ohtani’s name and holding up replica shirts. On Monday, they were out in force again, packing Gocheok Sky Dome to watch a warmup game against the South Korea national team. “He is god,” Kang Ji-ho, a baseball fan, told Agence France-Presse as he queued outside the 17,000-seat stadium, where tickets for Wednesday’s MLB opener sold out in minutes. “Japanese players are not popular in Korea, but Ohtani is different.” Ohtani has established himself as a peerless all-round ballplayer, a philanthropist and a respectful, if slightly wary, sports personality. This week he is carving out another, no less important role – that of goodwill ambassador.

Energy minister Chris Bowen says today’s default market offer on electricity - with the energy regulator saying consumers can expect price cuts of up to 7.1% - is “encouraging” but that there is “a long way to go”. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) have urged the Victorian government to follow coronial recommendations and introduce a pill-testing trial at fixed and mobile sites. A second Australian men’s cricket series against Afghanistan in as many years has been postponed due to the country’s poor record on human rights for women and girls. Australia had already cancelled a one-day international series last year due to “a marked deterioration” in the treatment of women and girls. An improvement in the situation was anticipated since then and it was hoped a three-match T20 series would be given the green light to take place in August this year. But Cricket Australia on Tuesday said the conditions were getting worse rather than better and decided to again call off the series. CA made its decision after consulting with the Australian government. A statement read: The government’s advice is that conditions for women and girls in Afghanistan are getting worse. For this reason, we have maintained our previous position and will postpone the bilateral series against Afghanistan. CA continues its strong commitment to supporting participation by women and girls in cricket around the world and will continue to actively engage the International Cricket Council and work closely with the Afghanistan Cricket Board to determine what actions could be taken to support the resumption of bilateral matches in the future. Public Interest Advocacy Centre calls on Labor to keep promise to protect LGTBQ+ students and teachers The Public Interest Advocacy Centre has called on the Albanese government to keep its promise to protect LGBTQI+ students and teachers and not shelve two draft bills on changes to religious discrimination laws. Earlier today, the prime minister threatened to shelve the two draft bills, citing concerns about divisive debate amid heightened Islamophobia and anti-semitism unless the opposition agrees to its “balanced” approach. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has refused to offer any commitment before seeing the proposed legislation, describing the move on Tuesday as a “set-up” to allow Labor to dump its election commitment. The director of policy and advocacy at the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Alastair Lawrie, said: Labor went to the May 2022 federal election with clear commitments to remove the special legal privileges that allow religious schools to discriminate against students and teachers on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. The Albanese government must fulfil their promise to protect LGBTQ students and teachers in religious schools against discrimination, rather than give a veto to Mr Dutton. LGBTQ teachers, and especially students, have waited far too long already to enjoy their rights to teach and learn free from the fear of mistreatment on the basis of who they are. And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening.

Government quietly removes offshore gas approvals bill after warnings from environmental groups The government has quietly removed from the notice paper for this week a controversial offshore gas bill introduced by the resources minister, Madeleine King. The bill seeks to preserve approvals for offshore gas projects, exempting them from reassessment if environmental laws are tightened. First Nations advocates including Mardudhunera activist Raelene Cooper, environmental groups, the Greens and Senator David Pocock have all warned the bill will effectively allow the resources minister, not the environment minister, to set the rule of offshore gas approvals and water down consultation requirements. The Greens have called on Labor to withdraw the controversial amendment in return for their support for vehicle emissions standards. A spokesperson for King said: The government is continuing to engage on the bill across the parliament. We look forward to passing this important reform which will bring much needed clarity to offshore regulations. At an inquiry hearing on Thursday, departmental officials said the government was open to clarifying the intent of the bill. Asked if this was the reason the bill had been withdrawn, King’s spokesperson said: As we have said, we are open to further strengthening to give everyone confidence about the intent of the bill. If you’re just catching up on today’s news, Mike Hohnen has our top stories here in our afternoon update: Cyclone Megan downgraded to tropical low, but severe weather warning in place Ex-Tropical Cyclone Megan has been downgraded to a tropical low after crossing onto the Northern Territory, although a severe weather warning is now in place for rain and wind. Some 700 residents in the town of Borroloola faced the worst of the cyclone on Monday evening when it crossed the coast on the south-western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria as a category 1 storm. The Bureau of Meteorology said the NT had seen rainfall totals in areas in the path of the cyclone of up to 289mm in the last 24 hours to 9am on Tuesday. In the next 24 to 48 hours, a BoM spokesperson said some parts of the territory could see rainfalls of up to 300mm: While Megan has been downgraded from a tropical cyclone to a tropical low, she’s still a significant weather system that is expected to bring heavy rainfall, flooding and damaging wind gusts to the Northern Territory over the coming days. Earlier we brought you news on the Albanese government’s threat to shelve two draft bills on changes to religious discrimination laws, citing concerns about divisive debate amid heightened Islamophobia and antisemitism. If you missed it, Sarah Basford Canales has the story here: Good afternoon, everyone. I’ll now be with you until this evening. The parliament is beginning to wind down, so I will hand the blog over to Jordyn Beazley to take you through the evening. Thank you so much to everyone who joined along with us for the second day of the sitting. We will be back early Wednesday, where we will be hearing the same arguments we have been hearing for the past 10 years. Can’t wait! In the mean time, take care, A x Guiding principle on religious freedom should be whether any proposal protects people of faith, Cash says Michealia Cash has released an official statement on the religious discrimination kerfuffle: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is being unrealistic if he expects a commitment to bipartisan support for religious discrimination laws the Coalition has not even seen yet. The briefing released following the government’s caucus meeting indicates they will not proceed with changes to the laws without bipartisan support. Senator Cash: We have not seen Labor’s draft Religious Discrimination bill and we have not seen their changes to the Sex Discrimination law. It is impossible to provide bipartisan support for bills we have not seen. The Attorney-General hasn’t even released the Australian Law Reform Commission report this legislation is guided by. Stakeholders have been telling me there are some very concerning aspects to the proposed legislation. From what we are hearing, Labor’s laws will severely weaken protections for religious schools and how they operate. We are also very concerned with reports of a vilification clause, with a test set so low, it will threaten freedom of speech. This legislation must be put through a rigorous parliamentary inquiry so all Australians can understand all the issues involved. The guiding principle here should be whether any proposal the government puts forward actually protects people of faith, or whether it takes religious people and institutions backwards.” Major donor cap would apply equally to all donors, says independent Kate Chaney The independent MP, Kate Chaney, has rejected Labor’s claim the crossbench is being hypocritical on donation reform. Chaney says: Under the bill I will be introducing, a major donor cap would apply equally to all donors, no matter who they donate to or how they donate, whether directly or through an aggregator. This simple cap model would take more than half the private money out of the system and stand up to constitutional challenge. People should be able to support their candidate by donating their time or money. A spending cap would stop people from being able to participate by donating. It’s hard to structure a spending cap that is actually fair to new challengers, because of the significant incumbency and party advantages. I’m open to considering a cap proposal from the government that is fair, but I haven’t seen one yet.” Queensland deputy premier says byelection results show opposition leader could lead the state The Queensland deputy premier, Cameron Dick, has pilloried the Liberal National Party for refusing to reveal its position on the government’s plan to upgrade Suncorp Stadium for the Olympic Games ceremonies.Labor MPs ditched their ministerial statements in parliament on Tuesday morning with only the premier addressing the house to defend the government’s decision to reject a proposal to build a $3.4bn stadium at Victoria Park. The government will instead go with the cheaper option of upgrading Suncorp Stadium and the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre. Dick told reporters on Tuesday the government’s strategy was to force the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, to reveal his party’s position. This weekend, the by-elections demonstrated that David Crisafulli could truly become the premier of Queensland. The question for David Crisafulli, it really is simple. Does he support the plan for good value games or does he support a new $3.4bn stadium at Victoria Park? The Labor government came to parliament today to fight ... We came to ensure that David Crisafulli could no longer run away from the most important question of today.” His comments came after LNP deputy leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said on Monday that if elected the party would go back to the drawing board and ask a planned independent infrastructure authority to make a plan. Labor’s Farrell says some teal MPs hypocrites on political funding The special minister of state, Don Farrell, has accused some teal independents of hypocrisy for proposing a cap of $1.5m on political donations but no cap on spending on election campaigns. Farrell said: Labor is committed to this reform. We need to stop billionaires throwing their money around and trying to buy our elections. Some of the teals are saying to us that they agree with banning big money, just not theirs.” Earlier today, teal MPs including Kate Chaney, Allegra Spender, Zali Steggall and Zoe Daniel rejected any suggestion of hypocrisy, noting that many of their donations were from smaller donations. We’ll bring you a full news story shortly. ABC to meet Ukrainian ambassador to discuss Russia-Ukraine documentary A spokesperson from the ABC has responded to criticism from the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia (which Daniel Hurst reported on earlier), saying the ABC will be meeting with the ambassador to discuss his concerns. The ABC on Monday broadcast a documentary from film maker Sean Langan on its Four Corners program, which presented the Russian side of the experience at the frontlines in the months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The spokesperson says: Ukraine’s War: The Other Side is a challenging but legitimate documentary made by reputable journalist Sean Langan and first aired last month on the UK’s ITV, that offers a rare insight into the lives of Russian soldiers during the war. It adds to our understanding of this tragic conflict and shows the full, horrific impact of the war. The reporter challenges the Russian soldiers and civilians featured in the film about their beliefs and opinions. The documentary is being seen internationally and is considered an important contribution to the reporting of the war. We believe Australian audiences also have the right to watch it and make up their own minds. Four Corners has broadcast several programs exploring aspects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, such as: Despair & Defiance: The Battle for Ukraine Inside Russia: Traitors and Heroes The People’s Fight: The Battle for Kherson The ABC will be meeting with the Ukrainian Ambassador to discuss his concerns. Australia, UK to discuss defence, climate, clean energy, cyber, and economic security  The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, isn’t the only international visitor to Australia, this week. The Australian government has confirmed it will welcome the UK’s foreign secretary (and former prime minister) David Cameron and the UK’s defence secretary, Grant Shapps. The pair will be in Canberra on Thursday for one-on-one talks with their direct counterparts, Penny Wong and Richard Marles. The four will then fly to Adelaide for annual all-in talks on Friday known as Aukmin. That’s not Aukus; it’s stands for the Australia-United Kingdom Ministerial Consultations. They will discuss ways to deepen cooperation between Australia and the UK “across defence, climate action and clean energy, cyber, and economic security”, a statement issued by the Australian government says. Marles says it is “an increasingly complex strategic environment” and he looks forward to “working with our United Kingdom counterparts this week to progress ambitious new initiatives to deepen our defence partnership”. Wong says Australia and the UK are “working together, including in the Indo-Pacific, for a world that is peaceful, stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty”. Peter Dutton is now saying the government “went to the election with a promise that has now turned into a lie” which is an interesting line to take, given that the voice was also an election promise, but Dutton and the Coalition called on the government to scrap the referendum because there was no bipartisan support. One of the reasons the government is shelving religious freedoms is because it does not want to have a debate on religion in the current climate of heightened Islamophobia and antisemitism when there is no bipartisan support for the bill. The government has learnt, through what happened in the voice referendum, what can happen when there is no bipartisan support in areas of great community sensitivity. But Dutton is saying the government should press on, regardless, because it was an election commitment.",2024-03-19T07:04:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/mar/19/australia-politics-live-interest-rates-rba-political-donations-crossbench-question-time-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-supermarkets-competition,The Guardian
Australia will bring home surveillance aircraft supporting Ukraine within weeks,"Australia is set to bring home a surveillance aircraft that has helped to protect the delivery of military and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, but denies it is part of any broader scaling back of support for the country. The Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail – which has conducted regular flying missions to monitor threats since its deployment to Germany in October – is likely to end its current role within weeks. The Wedgetail, based on the Boeing 737-700, features a long-range surveillance radar and is equipped to simultaneously track airborne and maritime targets, according to the RAAF. The original deployment was in response to a US request. It is understood the US has not requested an extension of the deployment beyond its April deadline, and there will not be a gap in western monitoring as a result of Australia ending the mission. A Defence spokesperson said the Wedgetail had helped protect the international flow of assistance into Ukraine “by providing early warning in the unlikely event of an act or threat from Russia, outside of Ukraine, against the gateway of humanitarian and military assistance”. Asked whether Australia would extend the deployment, the spokesperson said “any future requests for support” from Australia’s international partners would be “considered in the usual way”. Ukraine has sunk a number of ships in Russia’s powerful Black Sea fleet over the past two years, but the Australian Wedgetail was not providing information to enable such attacks, the spokesperson said. “The E-7A Wedgetail operates outside of Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian airspace. It is not providing surveillance assistance to Ukraine.” The Defence spokesperson emphasised that Australian troops continued to help train Ukrainian armed forces personnel in the UK. The situation in Ukraine, more than two years after Russia’s invasion, is likely to be on the agenda when British ministers visit Australia for talks this week. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, and the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, will hold the annual meeting with their counterparts, Penny Wong and Richard Marles, in Adelaide on Friday. Marles said it was “an increasingly complex strategic environment” and he looked forward to “working with our United Kingdom counterparts this week to progress ambitious new initiatives to deepen our defence partnership”. Wong said Australia and the UK were seeking “a world that is peaceful, stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty”. The Australian government’s position is to help Ukraine end the war “on its terms”. Last month it announced a further $50m grant to the UK-administered International Fund for Ukraine. This brought Australia’s total overall support to Ukraine to $960m, including $780m in military aid. However, the Ukrainian government is increasingly anxious about “fatigue” in western support, particularly amid a holdup in the US congress of a $60bn package for Ukraine. Australia once proclaimed it was “the largest non-NATO contributor” to Ukraine. But researchers working on the Kiel Institute’s Ukraine Support Tracker told the ABC last week that Australia had since slipped to be the fifth largest non-Nato contributor after Japan, Switzerland, South Korea and Austria. The Defence spokesperson said Australia continued to stand with its partners in offering support for Ukraine.",2024-03-19T06:34:29Z,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/19/australia-raaf-e-7a-wedgetail-plane-ukraine-russia-war-return-home,The Guardian
West condemns ‘undemocratic’ Russian election as results show Putin landslide,"Western nations have widely condemned Russia’s presidential election, in which Vladimir Putin claimed a landslide victory that will keep him in power until at least 2030 amid a crackdown on dissent and opposition. “These Russian elections starkly underline the depth of repression under President Putin’s regime, which seeks to silence any opposition to his illegal war,” said the British foreign secretary, David Cameron, as EU foreign ministers met to approve new sanctions against 30 individuals and organisations in response to the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. “Putin removes his political opponents, controls the media, and then crowns himself the winner. This is not democracy,” Cameron said. In Washington, the state department spokesperson Vedant Patel denounced the election as “undemocratic” and said the US would not congratulate Putin. “This was an incredibly undemocratic process,” Patel told reporters, detailing the jailing and disqualification of opponents and Navalny’s death in an Arctic penal colony. “He is likely to remain the president of Russia, but that does not excuse him of his autocracy,” Patel said. Calling Russia a dictatorship, a German government spokesperson said the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would not congratulate Putin on his re-election in a vote viewed by Berlin as “predetermined”. The official tally from the three-day election was a 87.28% share of the vote for Putin, which the Kremlin on Monday portrayed as a dominant victory, saying the results showed that the people had consolidated around the Russian president. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters: “This is the most eloquent confirmation of the level of support from the population of the country for its president, and its consolidation around him.” In a victory speech on Sunday, Putin dismissed western criticism of the election as unfair and undemocratic, telling his supporters it was “expected”. He also for the first time addressed Navalny’s death, which he called a “sad event”. At a concert on Moscow’s Red Square on Monday evening to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the annexation of Crimea, Putin basked in his election win, singing the national anthem with a crowd waving Russian flags. “Hand in hand, we will move forward and this will make us stronger ... Long live Russia,” Putin said. Putin’s swift seizure of Crimea in March 2014 is seen as the beginning of 10 years of military action against Ukraine and a cornerstone of Putin’s reimagined Russia. Putin told the crowd that Crimea was the “pride of Russia” and that the Black Sea peninsula had “come back to its native harbour” when Moscow annexed the region. He attended the concert alongside the three loyalist presidential candidates who ran against him. The Russian president usually speaks at the annual celebration that marks the Crimea annexation, a speech that was preceded on Monday by patriotic songs performed by pro-Putin singers. Several independent Russian outlets reported that state employees and students had been ordered to attend the celebrations. Russia has a long history of state employees being coerced to attend pro-government rallies. Together with the crowd, Putin sang the Russian national anthem before leaving the stage. Putin’s vote share, which equates to 76 million votes and is by far the biggest in post-Soviet Russian history, follows an election described as a mockery by an independent monitor group. The independent Russian election watchdog Golos said it had found unprecedented levels of fraud in the presidential elections. “Never before have we seen a presidential [election] campaign that fell so far short of constitutional standards,” said Golos, whose co-director is now in jail in Russia. “The elections failed to fulfil their main function: to reflect ​​the real mood of citizens, and they did not allow [citizens] to independently and freely make decisions about the future of their country,” it added. While shunned by the west, there were congratulations for Putin from the leaders of China and North Korea, two countries that have propped up Moscow in its fighting in Ukraine. Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed Putin’s “decisive victory”, the state news agency IRNA reported. Russia has deployed Iran-made drones against Ukrainian cities. Putin also received messages from India and the United Arab Emirates, two traditional western allies that Moscow has successfully courted since the start of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered his “warm congratulations” to Putin, adding that he looked forward to developing their “special” relationship. Russia is India’s biggest arms supplier.",2024-03-18T18:30:25Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/18/putin-election-result-russia-ukraine-war,The Guardian
Sunak and Badenoch put on united front in face of high-level fawning | Zoe Williams,"Before we go to the Business Connect conference in Warwickshire, a quick “previously in Tory endgame”: Rishi Sunak was under pressure, as even Conservative MPs who thought that however bad he was, changing leaders would be worse, were starting to revise their view. Penny Mordaunt’s name had been floated, but she was commonly thought of as the stalking horse candidate, for the more plausible Kemi Badenoch (at this point, you just have to imagine inverted commas round all the adjectives, a kind of “who-are-these-people?” confetti). Rishi had threatened a general election if people didn’t stop challenging his leadership. Kemi had told everyone not to be silly. And then the pair arrived before the burghers of Coventry and Warwickshire, to tell them how great the Conservatives were going to be for small businesses. Sunak had three main announcements: cutting taxes, cutting red tape and creating 20,000 apprenticeships. It was pretty dry fare. He didn’t even get a laugh when, talking about his determination to get rid of national insurance contributions, he said: “We’ll make more progress towards abolition in the next parliament.” Seriously? You seriously think you’ll be in parliament, rather than, say, California? He talked about the 2,000 EU regulations that have already been scrapped, the 500 more to go. He talked about the VAT threshold going up to £90,000. He talked about the absolute scandal that only 2% of equity investment goes to female founders. “I have two young girls,” he said, “and as a dad first and foremost, I want to make sure my girls grow up in a society where there isn’t a limit to their aspirations. Making sure that they have access to the finance they need is really important.” Right, so we definitely need a taskforce. No way could they ask their parents or, for that matter, their legit billionaire grandparents. Badenoch, afterwards, made the peculiar decision to repeat everything he’d just said, adding some truly minor tweaks to the machine, a new government advice body, to make sure everyone can use cutting-edge digital technology. She’s much more interesting when she goes off script, the business secretary. Describing in general terms (as Sunak did) the crises of this decade, she said: “What is actually phenomenal is that our businesses are still here.” Now she mentions it, it is quite surprising, but not because of Covid or Ukraine. How is anyone planning for the future in this permanent chaos? Then, off the cuff: “We all think of apprentices as being 19-year-olds who’ve never done a day’s work in their lives,” she said. Do we, though? Because that sounds like we think they’re lazy gits, whereas I think of them more as people who haven’t worked because they were busy at school and, before that, being babies. When I say “interesting”, of course I mean “scary”. Nobody wants to bandy around words like “North” and “Korea”, but my God, the fawning. First, to Sunak: “Your announcement is fantastic,” said Julie White of the construction industry. A bit more of a comment than a question, but hear her out. “But we seem to have devalued apprenticeships in the UK, because the only way into a fantastic job is through university.” “Perfect,” Sunak replied, presumably by accident. Indeed it was. A stage-managed praise-filled non-question, perfectly delivered. Then came George Paul, cheesemonger, who turns more than £10m a year in exports. “What advice would you give, for budding entrepreneurs, in our trade and all the rest of the British industries, to take that leap, to look for success?” Agog, we were. I like success as much as the next man. Can the prime minister help me look for it? “Start from a position of confidence in what you do,” he said. “The world wants to buy British. We stand for quality, we stand for best in class, we stand for innovation.” You’re already British, folks; now all you have to do is believe. Maybe close your eyes. If you have some red heels you could click, that might help. As hard as it to believe, Badenoch’s set piece was more sycophantic. She invited two entrepreneurs on to the stage, Thomas Hal Robson-Kanu who’s brought the turmeric shot to market, and Libby Hart, who makes women’s workwear, and asked them for their priority ask of government. Hart said two things: help British manufacturers find the skills (with apprentices) and invest in women. In other words, it would be beyond awesome if someone announced those two things you’ve just announced. Robson-Kanu went one better: “Really making the opportunities available, visible. By hosting days like today.” My businessman’s dream is if someone would put on an event like this one we’re currently sitting in. Journalists afterwards gave both a much tougher time, quizzing Sunak on his ungovernable party and Badenoch on Frank Hester, the racist stain that won’t go away. Their answers were variations on a theme; this is just Westminster nonsense, they’re interested in the real things that real people care about. Real things like whether the daughters of prime ministers will have access to venture capital, or be cruelly locked out by the scourge of sexism; like whether British businesses believe in their Britishness hard enough; like temporary tariff suspensions on 120 imports. Sunak and Badenoch put on a front in which not only were they united, but they’d found the last 15 people in the country who couldn’t agree more.",2024-03-18T16:13:37Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/18/rishi-sunak-kemi-badenoch-business-conservatives,The Guardian
Are progressive politics the real reason why US lawmakers are spooked by Tiktok? | Arwa Mahdawi,"Tick tock, tick tock … that’s the sound of time running out for Gen Z’s favourite app. On Wednesday the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill would require the TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media platform or get banned in the US. It’s not clear whether the bill would pass in the Senate. However, the White House has said it supports the legislation. All in all, things don’t look great for TikTok. Lawmakers would have you believe that the reason they’re on the warpath when it comes to TikTok is because Beijing-based ByteDance is a national security threat. They’re worried that China is going to do nefarious things with personal user data and that the TikTok algorithm has the ability to unduly influence Americans. It should be noted that while these fears aren’t unfounded, lawmakers’ obsession with the platform being controlled by China seems to ignore the fact that – as the Financial Times notes – “some 60% of [ByteDance] is actually owned by ‘international’ investors, overwhelmingly American”. While the US government may be citing national security as their motivation for clamping down on TikTok, influential model and activist Emily Ratajkowski has other ideas. On Thursday Ratajkowski told her 2.7 milliom TikTok followers that she reckons the government wants to ban the platform because it has become a hub for progressive activism. “Because this is one of the few platforms that isn’t completely controlled by the US government, or through corporations that have the US government’s interest in mind, progressive politics have been able to blossom on here,” Ratajkowski said. “TikTok is being banned,” she added, “because the US government is legitimately scared with the influence that it’s having … which to me indicates that TikTok is a very powerful tool for organization, for alternative thinking and for activism.” There’s certainly an argument to be made that the US government isn’t pleased with some of the progressive politics popping up on TikTok. Last year, for example, a number of members of Congress, along with some conservative activists and tech investors, expressed their outrage about the amount of pro-Palestinian content on the platform and argued that TikTok’s algorithm was biased towards Palestine. Funnily enough these same people don’t seem to have much to say about reports which show the US mainstream media is biased towards pro-Israel coverage. Nor do these critics seem particularly concerned about reports from the likes of Human Rights Watch which say Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, systemically censors voices in support of Palestine. TikTok, for its part, has said its algorithm isn’t pro-Palestine. Rather, the company noted in a statement, content on the platform simply reflects the fact that it has a young user base and “attitudes among young people skewed toward Palestine long before TikTok existed”. That said, it’s not even clear that there’s more pro-Palestinian content on TikTok than pro-Israel content – a lot depends on how you interpret that data. Nevertheless, it is certainly perceived to be friendlier towards pro-Palestinian content than other social media platforms. To be clear: I’m not trying to argue that US lawmakers want to ban TikTok just because of pro-Palestinian voices on the platform. Nor am I saying that TikTok is some beacon of progressive values. Far from it. It has a history of censoring LGBT content in certain areas. And, like almost every other social media app out there, it sucks up swathes of your personal data and does god knows what with it. I think it is right to be wary of TikTok’s power and influence and I think everyone should be alarmed at how much power a single app has. But it’s hardly like TikTok is the only worrying social media platform out there is it? If the US government wants to regulate how much influence tech companies have, and the extent to which they can mine our personal data, then they need to do it across the board, rather than singling out one particular platform. Again, I don’t think TikTok is, in itself, a beacon of progressive values. However, Ratajkowski is right in saying it has been a useful platform for a lot of progressive activists. Not just when it comes to Palestine, but also when it comes to issues like abortion, trans rights and anti-racism efforts. In increasingly authoritarian times we need to protect free speech with everything we’ve got. Banning TikTok is a blatant attack on our first amendment rights and the bipartisan support this ban is receiving should worry us all. Cheering on government-led censorship is a dangerous road that doesn’t lead anywhere good. Earlier this week Stone told the Louis Theroux podcast that she’d been pressured into sleeping with Baldwin in the 1993 film Silver. Per Stone, the late Robert Evans, who headed production at Paramount, said she should have sex with her co-star to improve his performance. “Not sure why Sharon Stone keep talking about me all these years later?” Baldwin tweeted on Tuesday. “Does she still have a crush on me or is she still hurt after all these years because I shunned her advances?” He added: “Wonder if I should write a book and tell the many, many disturbing, kinky and unprofessional tales about Sharon? That might be fun.” Baldwin (not to be confused with his more successful brother Alec) has had an extremely forgettable career and I’ve got a feeling these sexist tweets are going to end up being what he’s most famous for. “Because Butler is a human rights activist, as well as a theorist, the urgent point conveyed by this book is the same as it is in all their work,” writes Finn MacKay in a Guardian review of Butler’s new book, which advocates for gender diversity. “Why are so many people seemingly happy to give away their power to increasingly authoritarian forces? And why are they so confident that this power will never be used against them?” This law isn’t new but has recently gained nationwide attention.

‘Everything is possible’: a worrying new book explores the danger of disinformation,"You might not have heard of Rosanne Boyland. She made the 10-hour drive from Kennesaw, Georgia, to Washington on 5 January 2021. The next day, the 34-year-old died after losing consciousness in the crush of a mob of Donald Trump supporters as it surged against US Capitol police. She would never have been there, her sister said later, “if it weren’t for all the misinformation”. The tragedy opens Barbara McQuade’s new book, Attack from Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America. The NBC News and MSNBC legal analyst explores how the deliberate spreading of lies disguised as truth has been weaponised to consolidate power in the hands of the few, undermine legal structures and drive voters such as Boyland. It is both cause and symptom of the US’s corrosive polarisation. A former national security prosecutor, McQuade has seen the threat of disinformation evolve from al-Qaida to Islamic State to cyber-attacks from Russia. Teaching at the University of Michigan Law School, where she is a professor, she had her students study special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on 2016 election interference by Russia. “I was fascinated by the details of accounts that were created by Russian operatives with names like Blacktivist or Heart of Texas posing as grassroots activists on the right or the left or various groups, and then taking very divisive stands on various issues just in an effort to sow discord,” McQuade, 59, says in an interview in the lobby of a Washington hotel. It was then Trump’s bogus “stop the steal” movement in 2020, based on the big lie of widespread voter fraud rejected in more than 60 lawsuits and by his own attorney general, that inspired her to write the book. It considers lessons learned ahead of a potential repeat in 2024 as the US braces for a Joe Biden v Trump rematch. “We will definitely get interference from foreign adversaries, including Russia and probably China, North Korea, maybe Iran, but there is a domestic part of this now where we are already hearing Donald Trump talk about how voting by mail is unreliable and laying the groundwork so that, if and when he loses, and there are more Democrats who have voted by mail than Republicans, he will have credibility. “He will say: ‘See, I won the election and then it all flipped for me. It was fraud.’ The same strategy that he used in in 2020. I don’t know if he’ll have new strategies but ‘stop the steal’ was a classic disinformation influence campaign based on no evidence whatsoever.” Trump commentary falls into categories. Some stop short of drawing comparisons with Adolf Hitler, perhaps wary of Godwin’s law, which holds that as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches. Others dive in, arguing that some aspects of Trump’s authoritarianism, nativism and charisma do evoke the Nazi tyrant in enlightening ways. McQuade goes there with an “authoritarian playbook” charting a brief history of disinformation from Hitler and Benito Mussolini to Jair Bolsonaro and Trump and noting the tactics: demonising the other, seducing with nostalgia, silencing critics, muzzling the media, condemning the courts and stoking violence. She elaborates: “Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf that there are two things that are essential to effective propaganda. One was a very simple repeatable message because when people hear a message repeated again and again – and start hearing it from different sources – they begin to believe it to be true. “The other is that the bigger the lie, the more likely it is to be believed. All of us are guilty of white lies from time to time that we might say out of kindness. My sister might say your hair looks fine when she means anything but, or my husband might say to me, no, dear, that dress doesn’t make you look fat. “They’re saying these things out of kindness, even though they might be technically lying. As Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf, most people would not ever imagine that anyone could have the audacity to lie about something that is so significant – he was talking about the role of Jewish people in society, for example. “But here the big lie for Trump was that the election has been stolen because people say: ‘How could you possibly pull that off? It’s so ridiculous.’ That’s part of what gives it its credibility and he knows that so I worry we’re going to begin to hear that again, and there are a significant number of Americans who still believe that the 2020 election was stolen. There will always be people who are manipulated by those strategies.” Now the history of the January 6 insurrection itself is being rewritten, with the rioters recast as “patriots” and, if tried and imprisoned, as “hostages” whom Trump is promising to pardon if elected. Opinion polls show that more than a third of Americans believe that Biden’s election was illegitimate; Republicans are more sympathetic to the US Capitol rioters now than they were in 2021. McQuade says with some dismay: “They assaulted people, they brought weapons, they broke windows, they spread faeces on the walls of the temple of democracy, they carried Confederate flags in there. Now to refer to it as legitimate political discourse or ordinary tourist activity, and then to refer to people who have been arrested, charged and imprisoned for their crimes as hostages, is absolutely a brand of disinformation. I’m curious to see how many people will continue to fall for that in this election.” Trump svengali Steve Bannon, an arch election denier and vaccine conspiracy theorist, once memorably declared that the real opposition was the media and the way to deal with them was to “flood the zone with shit”. This brings to mind the Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. McQuade cites the Russian author and journalist Peter Pomerantsev on “the fog of unknowability”. She explains: “Everything is possible and nothing matters, and so everything’s PR because people begin to doubt the very existence of truth. One day Putin might say the missiles were shot by Ukraine; the next day the missiles were shot by Russia; the next day the missiles were shot by Nato. “People don’t know what to think and consistency doesn’t matter. In fact, inconsistency is part of the point, because first people become angry and then they become cynical and then finally they become numb and disengaged from politics altogether and so that’s a very dangerous place for democracy. “The other thing that people think in Russia is that truth is for suckers: you should just get what you can while you can and everybody is corrupt, which is one of the things that causes Donald Trump to constantly be suggesting that the Bidens are corrupt – if everybody is corrupt, then it gives you permission to overlook Donald Trump’s corruption, right? “‘Well, they’re all corrupt. Who knows what to believe? All these investigations are themselves weaponised and corrupt so I might as well look for someone who is strong, who will advance my values despite all of his corruption.’ This normalisation of corruption is something that is part of it all as well.” How has it come to this? McQuade, who was born in Detroit and lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan, identifies three central causes. First, the delivery mechanism of disinformation has changed. For centuries, the deceiver had to rely on word of mouth or leaflets or planting a false story, perhaps in a foreign newspaper, in the hope that someone would pick it up and pass it on. Now someone can spread a lie at the push of a button. “Social media is a wonderful tool and can connect us to people all over the world in wonderful ways, but can also be used as a weapon when people want to and so it has been a really efficient vehicle for delivering disinformation,” says the author. “They’re completely unaccountable and we have ceded all of our power on social media to a handful of young bro billionaires, whose interest, of course, is in their own profits, not in the social good.” Second, we are living through the worst political divisions in America since the 1861-1865 civil war. McQuade reckons it began with the combative, attention-grabbing Republican Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, and has grown as parties concentrate on turning out their bases rather than finding common ground. With elections framed as an existential struggle between good and evil, voters demand political purity. “If my tribe says X then I say X too, even if I don’t believe X to be true.” Third, there is anxiety about a changing world: the climate crisis, refugees and border security, economic shifts with potential job losses. It is fertile soil for demagogues who promise that they alone can fix it. “We have leaders who want to use that to stoke fear because they perceive that that will be in their own political interest to attract those voters who are concerned about those changes and attract them into their own fold. “It’s a combination of those three things that Donald Trump has exploited in this country like no one we’ve ever seen. I don’t think that he’s necessarily a political genius, but I do think he’s a conman and a marketing genius who knows how to sell things. He’s a huckster and he has taken advantage of this moment for personal and political gain.” The huckster’s rise nearly a decade ago caught the media off guard. The old and laudable rules of balance, impartiality and not editorialising no longer seemed to work when one candidate was so blatantly mendacious. The New York Times newspaper broke the seal in 2016 with the headline: Trump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent. But as another election looms, McQuade worries that journalists have still not figured out how to cover him. “That which is novel is always newsworthy, that which is controversial is always newsworthy, and so they present those things. But in an effort to present both sides of a story and in a tradition of not calling people liars, they have allowed Donald Trump and his supporters to manipulate them and play them. They’ll just say he made a statement that is not backed up by evidence; say he’s lying! You gotta say it out loud.” But Attack from Within is not a letter of surrender or obituary of America. McQuade offers solutions for countering disinformation and maintaining the rule of law, such as making domestic terrorism a federal crime, reviving local journalism, criminalising doxxing (the act of revealing identifying information about someone online) and considering a ban on online anonymous accounts. The former US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan urges politicians to get ahead of the curve of artificial intelligence. “I hope that our Congress can do something which we failed to do with social media, which is get ahead of it, because if it can put things in place before they create havoc, it’s much easier than trying to react after the fact.” Individual citizens, she says, can gain skills be critical consumers of social media. “We can educate ourselves and take responsibility by doing things like, when we read an article, don’t rely just on the headline; we should actually read the article before we forward it to someone else. “We should look for second sources of a story; if there’s an outrageous story, someone else will be reporting it. If there is data in a story, we should look at that data. How big was the sample set? Was it a sample of three or a sample of 3m? That makes a difference. Were the results of this study a causation or just coincidence with an outcome? We need to do that.” McQuade also calls for increasing media literacy in schools and a revival of teaching civics rather than focusing on test scores. “Civics education is important for all of us, because when someone explains to you how the separation of powers works and how the three branches of government work, it is impossible to believe that a president could be immune from prosecution. We all need that education.” Attack from Within is out now",2024-03-16T07:18:01Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/16/attack-from-within-book-dangers-of-disinformation,The Guardian
The Guardian view on child mortality: it’s bad – but it’s getting better | Editorial,"In 2022, almost 5 million children under five died around the world – equivalent to one death every six seconds. Each one of those deaths is a story of grief and of unfulfilled potential; of the farmers, scientists, labourers, poets and traders who will not be. The large majority of these deaths, tallied in a UN report published this week, were entirely preventable. Those growing up in the highest-mortality country face a risk of dying before age five that is 80 times greater than in the lowest-mortality country. Yet as grim as the figure is, it is also cause for optimism. This was a historic low. More children are surviving today than ever before. The global mortality rate for this age group has declined by 51% since 2000. There is no one simple explanation for this fall: it came from sustained hard work across a range of measures, from support in childbirth to vaccination drives to nutrition programmes. That same determination will be required if the sustainable development goal of ending preventable deaths of children aged under five by 2030 is to be met. That would save 9 million lives. But progress in reducing neonatal and young child mortality has slowed, compared to the leaps of the millennium development goal era. That largely reflects the fact that many of the easy wins available have already been made, such as increasing vaccine coverage and basic treatment. If current trends continue, 59 countries will miss the SDG target. And that is not the worst case scenario. The impact of the climate crisis, the economic effects of the pandemic and its disruption of vaccinations, and wars in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, Myanmar and elsewhere, are painful reminders that the risk is not only of health gains stagnating; they could well go into reverse. Children in conflict-hit countries are, unsurprisingly, much more likely to die. The global food crisis means that the number of people going hungry rose by 122 million, to 735 million, between 2019 and 2022. The report notes that “uninterrupted mortality decline is precarious, requiring unyielding commitment and investment.” It also warns of “the possibility that crisis, fragility and conflict become more frequent in the years to come”. The five countries with the highest child mortality rates are all in sub-Saharan Africa, with south Asia also showing high rates. Yet progress has not only come in relatively wealthier places. Three low-income countries – Malawi, Rwanda and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – and four lower-middle-income countries – Cambodia, Mongolia, Sâo Tomé and Principe, and Uzbekistan – have reduced under-five mortality by more than 75% since 2000. Hans Rosling, the late Swedish physician whose book Factfulness argued that most of us fail to recognise global progress, once wrote: “Does saying ‘things are improving’ imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it’s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.” To say that millions of children are dying preventable deaths is to face a horrifying truth. But it need not mean succumbing to despair: though they have not been prevented, such future losses can be. Commitment to, and investment in, the health of children yields dramatic results. We must recognise and celebrate the resulting gains. We should also use them as a spur to redouble efforts.",2024-03-15T18:30:42Z,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-child-mortality-its-bad-but-its-getting-better,The Guardian
‘It’s so weird’: the TV show about a woman who turns into a chicken nugget,"Last December, Netflix released an exhaustive report entitled What We Watched, detailing the time its subscribers spent watching every film and television programme on its platform. One of the biggest surprises was the sheer number of foreign-language productions we consume. In total, these productions accounted for a full third of all streamed Netflix content. And leading the way was South Korea. The report revealed that, following the planet-conquering phenomenon that was Squid Game, the K-drama series The Glory was the third most-watched Netflix show globally. This, you have to admit, is incredible. There is a huge global hunger for Korean output. If it comes from South Korea, people will watch it in their droves. Possibly. Because the newest South Korean series to hit Netflix is Chicken Nugget. It’s a television series about a woman who turns into a chicken nugget and, as such, might be one of the oddest things currently available to watch. Based on a webcomic by Park Jidok, whose previous work includes comics called Potato Village and Killer Farts, Chicken Nugget is almost aggressively esoteric. The story is about a hapless intern at a machine company who harbours a crush on his boss’s daughter. But then a mysterious machine appears in the office, and she gets into it and accidentally says the words “chicken nugget” out loud, and it turns her into one. Imagine a version of The Fly where Jeff Goldblum gets fully turned into a fly after just 15 minutes and you’re on the right track. Also, in this version of The Fly, Goldblum gets turned into a small piece of chicken, one of the only things on Earth that is less dramatically interesting than a fly. That’s roughly where we are. Unlike something like Squid Game, which came swaggering in laden with extremely expensive Hollywood-level production design, Chicken Nugget was very clearly made on the cheap. It’s bright like a daytime soap opera, it has very few traditional action sequences and a big percentage of its visual-effects budget seems to have been spent on making a chicken nugget wobble very slightly. It’s so weird and bargain basement-y that there is a good chance you will get a few minutes into the first episode and decide that Chicken Nugget is simply not for you. But this would be a mistake. I was fully ready to bail on the show, until a brief sequence where the father of the woman who turned into a chicken nugget grieves her predicament. He remembers bringing her up alone after the death of her mother. He’s scared and overwhelmed, but he’s proud of the woman she’s becoming. And I’ll be damned if it isn’t one of the most unexpectedly moving things I’ve seen in an age. Somehow this stupid show, one that often feels as if it was free-associated rather than traditionally written, wrestled a true emotional response from me. From there, inexplicably, Chicken Nugget keeps getting better and better. It becomes less about the weirdness of a woman who is trapped in chicken form, and more about the bonding that happens between the two people who try to get her back. Soon, the girl’s father and the intern team up to try to discover what exactly happened to her, uncovering a long and complicated conspiracy that branches off down a number of incredibly strange tributaries that, among other things, provide a whistlestop journey through Korean culinary history. Sign up to What's On Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday after newsletter promotion Given its meagre budget, the show takes some bold formal leaps, too. We travel hundreds of years into the past, and several decades into the future, in our attempt to figure out exactly what happened to this poor nugget lady. Extraordinary new characters are introduced. There’s an ambition here that cannot be tamed. Had Chicken Nugget been given the blockbuster treatment, there’s a chance that all this would have come off as overwrought, as something being prestige just for the sake of it. But the show’s shonky, cheapo production prevents that. It has to rely on charm alone to get by, and this is something it has in spades. Realistically, Chicken Nugget won’t get close to equalling The Glory’s popularity. If it even makes the top half of the next What We Watched report I’ll be staggered. It’s far too bizarre and homemade for that. But those who will watch Chicken Nugget will love it completely, and isn’t that really the best metric?",2024-03-15T16:09:40Z,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/15/its-so-weird-the-tv-show-about-a-woman-who-turns-into-a-chicken-nugget,The Guardian
The one thing we’ve learned from the Kate photo scandal? There’s no such thing as a fairytale life | Zoe Williams,"Kensington Palace, which remains in its private quarters the London residence of Prince William and Kate (for ever to be known as) Middleton, currently has an exhibition in its public rooms of “Untold Lives”, a medley of royal servants. If any of the tourists walking round on Thursday felt the piquancy of treading so close to a home Kate Middleton may or may not be in (for the first time since her marriage, probably, nobody can say for sure where she is), that didn’t show on their politely interested faces. The opening portrait is of Bridget Holmes: 96 years old, carrying a mop in comedic representation of her role as a “necessary woman” to monarchs all the way from Charles I to William III. Taking into account the different conception of childhood in the 1590s, when she was born, we can reasonably assume Holmes spent about 90 continuous years shovelling shit, her life remaining untold so that the story of kings could be told. That’s the deal with the monarchy; inequality needs two halves – a large number of lives debased and made menial to enable some shiny ones at the top. It would have made perfect sense when kings, having divine right, were a bridge between men and God, and a reasonable amount of sense in an age of greater deference, but these days it only makes sense if the spectacle of enormous wealth is itself somehow nourishing to the national psyche. If William and Kate represent some fantasy life, that we can enjoy remotely as a fairytale, projecting ourselves into it, then – here’s a cute paradox – the more that costs, the more it’s worth it. It never did it for me, but what do I know? The Prince and Princess of Wales only have one job in this contract, which is to enjoy perfect lives. People always go on about how hard the royals work, and I’ve never really bought it – how hard can it be, going places, shaking hands, being polite, going home? But if the real job is to embody a life in which wealth, being magic, has erased every care, then I can see that would be awesomely hard work. Just how much damage this family has inflicted on itself since Kate was last seen in public on Christmas Day will be impossible to determine until the mystery has lifted. Certainly, they’ve breached their contract with the world’s media. When news agencies had to pull the Mother’s Day photo of the princess and her three children, believing it to have been doctored, this holed them beneath the waterline, trust wise, and it’s hard to see how they could now recover. Phil Chetwynd, global news director of Agence France-Presse, described neutrally on BBC Radio 4 that the Firm had moved into the same credibility bucket as North Korea, which seems harsh – almost nobody, except everyone on the internet, thinks Kate Middleton has been shot in the head – but fair. Trust is pretty binary: you either have it or you don’t. The relationship between the British press and the royals has been vexed for ages, observably since Meghxit but arguably since Diana. The deal was supposed to be this: the tabloid press would write fawningly about the core team, choose one or two hate figures whose privacy would be traduced and inner life relentlessly speculated upon, and the Firm would enable all that with tactical intel drops and the turning of a blind eye. It really did seem in 1997 as though that equilibrium had been destroyed. In the aftermath of Diana’s death, the red tops talked about a “vast outpouring of grief”, and that was real, but they omitted to mention the rage people felt towards the newspapers that had hounded her. The palace, though, sought no vengeance. Only Harry admitted even holding a grudge, and things were back to normal pretty soon. Harry and Meghan’s various cases against the press were a mixed bag – some won, some dropped. What they didn’t achieve was any significant realignment of the media/monarchy protocols. In the end, it’s Harry living in the US, trying to make sense of a life he wasn’t born to rule, not the Daily Mail. With the British public, though, the royals’ contract is completely different. A small but growing number of us wish they would simply desist, become normal, stop costing so much. A sizeable middle doesn’t care one way or the other, and those who do watch these lives with fascinated admiration need them to be perfect. We can talk loftily about William and Kate’s missteps – how could they have been so stupid as to Photoshop an image, and so amateurishly? Don’t they know the first rule of lying, in public life, which is: stop doing it and tell the truth? But they haven’t been stupid at all, they’ve behaved exactly as humans do, trapped in a deal they can’t uphold. They cannot lead the perfect, trouble-free lives that they have to lead in order to make sense. The rumours and theories about what’s happened to Kate Middleton are so varied and lurid now that whatever the truth is, I anticipate its landing as a bit of an anticlimax, which will hasten the return of normality. So maybe they’ve actually played a blinder, and with their secrecy and cack-handedness generated a drama against which the truth will look like no big deal. But I don’t think this was deliberate. I think their lives are, ironically, a bit like a fairytale, but one of the dark ones, where a troll (or a nation of trolls) holds them hostage to an impossible demand.

Chinese state media body condemns police harassment at site of deadly blast,"China’s journalist association has issued a rare rebuke over police harassment, after videos emerged of state media journalists being pushed away from the site of a deadly explosion. In a statement published on Wednesday evening, the All-China Journalists Association (AJCA), a Communist party-backed group, said that “legitimate interviews are a journalist’s right”, adding that the authorities “should not simply and brutally obstruct the media journalists from performing their duties in a normal manner in order to control public opinion”. The unusually forthright comments came after videos emerged of two state media journalists being blocked from reporting from the scene of a explosion in the northern province of Hebei. The blast, which killed seven people and injured 27, was triggered by a suspected gas leak in a restaurant. In one video, uniformed men interrupt the broadcast of Yang Hailing, a CCTV reporter, as she speaks to news anchors in the studio of the state broadcaster from the site of the explosion. One of the anchors looks visibly shocked as the report is obstructed. In another, a group of police officers surround Xu Mengzhe, a reporter who is clearly wearing a badge displaying the logo of China Media Group, the state-media parent company of CCTV and other broadcasters. In the video, Xu says: “We are three reporters surrounded by a dozen people, a dozen people pushed [us] apart, come and take a look”. “With such a major public safety incident, people are looking forward to learning more information. Journalists use a professional lens to record the actual disaster situation and the rescue process,” said the ACJA. The association said that the work of journalists was necessary to tackle online misinformation and “protect the people’s right to know”. The videos sparked a debate on Chinese social media, with some users saying that the reporters were moved for their own safety. China’s constitution guarantees press freedom. In reality, state media is tightly controlled and journalists for domestic and international outlets are routinely harassed, often physically, in the course of their reporting. Last year, three police officers were detained after a Chinese journalist was assaulted while trying to investigate the deaths of two teachers in Guizhou. Reporters Without Borders ranks China as the second-worst country in the world for press freedom, with only North Korea scoring worse. The ACJA’s statement contained “very unusual language” said David Bandurski, director of the China Media Project. “They’re basically upholding the right to report” and “upholding an idea that information is valuable to the public”, two concepts which “sound very much like a view of journalism that has been actively opposed” in China, particularly under the rule of China’s president, Xi Jinping. As of Thursday morning, the statement had been deleted from the association’s website but was still available on WeChat. Many comments on Chinese social media expressed support for the statement, saying that the rights of journalists to report on news events should be protected. Other commentaries asked why the ACJA had not defended other journalists, such as one who was beaten up in Guizhou. “Is this the first day you know this truth?” asked one liberal commentator on Weibo. “If you really care about journalists’ interview rights, you don’t have to wait until something happens to a CCTV reporter before you speak out.” Additional research by Chi Hui Lin",2024-03-14T05:57:35Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/14/china-explosion-restaurant-blast-state-media-police-harassment,The Guardian
Dutton’s blast of radioactive rhetoric on nuclear power leaves facts in the dust | Temperature Check,"We may not yet be entering a nuclear age in Australia, but we would all be best advised to handle the rhetoric around the issue as carefully as we would radioactive waste. This week opposition leader Peter Dutton said an annual CSIRO report that had included estimates of costs for small modular reactors – which are not yet available commercially – was “discredited” because it “doesn’t take into account some of the transmission costs, the costs around subsidies for the renewables”. Dutton is referring to a report known as GenCost, which calculates the cost of generating electricity from different technologies when fuel, labour and capital are included. This metric is known as the levelised cost of electricity. Despite Dutton’s claim, the most recent GenCost report does include the cost of integrating renewables such as solar and wind into the electricity grid. That is, it includes the cost of building new transmission lines and energy storage such as batteries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The most recent GenCost report estimates a theoretical small modular reactor built in 2030 would cost $382 to $636 per megawatt hour. It says this is much more expensive than solar and wind, which it puts at between $91 and $130 per MWh even once integration costs are included. The calculations in GenCost don’t include subsidies for any generating technologies – including renewables or future SMRs. The cost estimates for SMRs are challenging because no commercial plant has been built. But the closest a project has got to existing – the Carbon-Free Power Project in Utah – was cancelled late last year primarily because the cost of the power would have been too high. And that project was given more than $2bn from the US Department of Energy. Mycle Schneider is an independent nuclear expert and coordinator of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status report that tracks nuclear power development around the globe. He points to research from US financial group Lazard that says in the US, the costs of unsubsidised solar and wind including firming costs, such as batteries, range from US$45 to $141 per MWh compared to new-build nuclear at US$180 per MWh. “That is no doubt one reason why global investments in stationary batteries outpaced investments in nuclear in 2023,” he said. On Tuesday, Dutton said he would soon reveal six potential sites for nuclear reactors around Australia – likely to be close to, current or retiring coal-fired power stations. Shadow energy minister Ted O’Brien claimed this week Australia could have nuclear power “up and running” within a decade. “Nuclear ‘up and running within a decade’ does not fit with the experience we have seen elsewhere,” said Prof MV Ramana, a nuclear expert at the University of British Columbia and a contributor to the nuclear industry status reports. Ramana points to Finland that has operated reactors since the 1970s, where parliament voted in 2002 to add a fifth reactor to the country’s fleet. Work started in 2005 but the reactor didn’t connect until 2022 “almost exactly 20 years after the parliamentary vote,” he said. “We can see similar long periods of time between decisions to build reactors and when they start operating, again in countries that already have nuclear plants, in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.” Dutton and O’Brien have both said there are 30 economies around the world using nuclear and “50 more” that want to. But Schneider says there are actually 32 countries with nuclear reactors, “but the top five generators produced 72% of the nuclear electricity in the world.” “Over the past 30 years, only four countries started nuclear programs (Romania, Iran, Belarus, UAE) and three phased out their programs (Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Germany). There are reactors under construction in three more newcomer countries (Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkiye). Most other ‘plans’ are vague.” On Sky News, O’Brien pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a country that had commissioned South Korea’s Kepco to build four reactors of the size that could be considered for Australia in less than a decade. In fact, each of the 1.4GW UAE plants was expected to be delivered in five years, but took eight, according to the industry status report. And it took 12 years from the announcement of the plan in 2008, to the first unit coming online in 2020. The problem with using the UAE as a case study is that it is not a democracy, but an autocracy. “The UAE is not a good model for Australia,” Ramana said. The full cost of the project isn’t known, and the country did not have to worry about selecting sites (the plant is built in the desert on the coast), passing legislation through parliament – including to create regulatory bodies – or gaining environmental approvals. In 2017, the Korea Times reported 17,000 workers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, India and other developing countries had been brought in to work at the reactor sites. Another 3,000 South Koreans were also working on the plants, the newspaper said. Experts have told the Guardian that even if Australia were to remove its federal and state bans on nuclear energy, it would be unlikely to see reactors generating power until the 2040s – at which point most, if not all, of Australia’s coal-fired power will have been turned off years earlier. One nuclear advocate questioned whether Australia could actually find a company to build reactors. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion This week one political journalist said on Sky that “Canada is about to put in small modular reactors” and had selected a site in Ontario. While Ontario Public Generation does plan to build a fleet of four small modular reactors, the company doesn’t yet have a licence to construct them. If it does go ahead, OPG has said it doesn’t expect the first-of-its-kind unit – each about one-tenth the size of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant – to be working commercially until the end of 2029. O’Brien and Dutton have rejected the notion that Australia would be “starting from scratch” on nuclear, citing the existence of the tiny reactor at Lucas Heights near Sydney, the country’s existing reserves of uranium and the agreement to buy nuclear-powered submarines in the future. Glenne Drover, the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Institute of Energy and a broad supporter of nuclear power, said it was “quite a step up” from the 20MW Lucas Heights research reactor “to 1,000MW+ and to build, own and operate a pressure reactor”. Drover said the expertise within the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation was a good start “but [Australia] would need a lot more, and would be trying to do this at the same time as UK, France, Canada and USA, and a few others.” As for uranium reserves, he said: “Yes we have uranium, but we do not have processing/concentrating. That is very specialist. It would be quite a leap to start doing that here.” Writing in The Australian last weekend, Danish political scientist Bjørn Lomborg said the news media made it feel as though “climate change is making the planet unliveable” but such an impression was “wildly misleading”. “Deaths have dropped precipitously,” he wrote. “Across the past decade, climate-related disasters have killed 98% fewer people than a century ago.” To achieve fewer disaster deaths, we should promote prosperity, adaptation, and resilience.But when we are inundated with ‘weather porn’ and miss the fact that deaths have dropped precipitously, we end up focusing on the least effective policies first.https://t.co/T9n50Qx1GS pic.twitter.com/roT1gNnzgt Lomborg, whose same article appeared a few weeks ago in the New York Post, has been making a similar claim for several years, pointing to data from EM-DAT – the International Disaster Database. Dr Damien Delforge, a researcher at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters that administers the database, said he regarded Lomborg’s claims as a “skewed and crude trend analysis” that was “irrelevant to current climate change management and discussions”. The database has well-known biases. The data also doesn’t fully capture the health impact of climate change, Delforge said. The creation of the US government’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the 1960s and gradual improvements in communication technologies has seen many more disasters being reported in modern times. The centre actually warns that pre-2000 data should be excluded from any trend analysis. Delforge said Lomborg’s starting decade of the 1920s had just 39 disasters in the database with mortality figures. Of the deaths from that decade, he said, 99% came from only four disasters – two famines in China that killed 3.5 million people, a 1921 drought that killed 1.2m in Ukraine and a 1922 typhoon that killed 100,000 in the Chinese city of Shantou. The famines were exacerbated by lack of relief and political decisions that left many to starve. “Were these events’ mortality impacts primarily driven by climate or political conditions?” Delforge asked. “Is it appropriate to base contemporary policy decisions on climate change on four events that occurred in China and the Soviet Union during the 1920s?” Factchecks by Reuters and USA Today about similar claims on death rates made by others have found them to be false or misleading.

The pope wants Ukraine to surrender. That would give Russia a green light for endless war | Nathalie Tocci,"The suggestion from Pope Francis that Ukraine should have the “courage” to raise the “white flag” and negotiate a settlement with (in other words, surrender to) Russia was deeply shocking for Kyiv and its backers. The understandably outraged response from Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was that the only flag Kyiv would raise was its own: the yellow and blue of Ukraine. Some may think that the pope’s words are inconsequential to how this war unfolds. It is not the first time Pope Francis has displayed overtly pro-Russian sympathies, nor has the Vatican’s mediation, for instance regarding the liberation of Ukrainian children kidnapped by Russia, been successful so far. So what if the pope speaks out again about the war, given that his views are already known and his practical efforts to address the humanitarian dimensions of the war have failed? Yet the pope’s words are extremely relevant, and dangerously so. First, they provide moral cover to an unabashedly pro-Kremlin line that runs deep in some quarters in the west, from Trumpian Republicans in the US to the nationalist right and populist left in Europe, to the point of being almost mainstream in countries like my own, Italy. Claiming that the war can only end with Ukraine’s surrender is precisely what Vladimir Putin has been preaching for more than two years. The fact that a religious authority such as the Vatican toes the same line provides incredible political ammunition to the Kremlin and its cheerleaders in Europe and beyond. Second, the pope’s words matter because they reflect views that are widespread in the global south. In fact, rather than a pro-Russian sentiment, what the pope projects is a deep-rooted anti-westernism. This consequently taints his reading of the war, with its emphasis on Nato’s presumed culpability and the agenda of the western military-industrial complex. The west’s failure to persuasively make its case in the global south is a problem for it, especially as the views and voices of the south matter more and more in today’s international relations. The problem has been greatly exacerbated by the US and Europe’s unwillingness to halt Israel’s catastrophic war in Gaza. Precisely because the pope’s words matter, it’s important to say why he’s wrong. I believe he’s wrong on the past, the present and perhaps most importantly the future. The pope betrays his underlying beliefs on the past causes of the war through both admission and omission. Two years since the invasion began, Ukraine is, it is now generally accepted, struggling on the battlefront. Some could claim that the pope’s call for surrender is therefore purely driven by detached political realism (perhaps an odd theoretical tradition for a religious authority, but nevertheless), so it is better to give in now than to persevere in defeat. However, if realism is really what motivates the pope, why didn’t he call on Russia to surrender and withdraw when its first attempt to subjugate Ukraine failed and Ukraine recaptured about half of the territory it lost in the first few weeks of the invasion? When the pope talks of Ukraine raising the white flag while making no mention whatsoever of Russia, what he’s actually doing is perversely blaming Ukraine (and the west) for provoking Russia into war (for instance, by aspiring to enter Nato), totally neglecting the imperial ambitions that drove the Kremlin to invade Ukraine. Yet the past is past, and there’s probably nothing that can change strongly held beliefs on the causes of the war. Those, like the pope, who believe that the west is to blame for it all, will probably continue to do so regardless of the evidence produced to prove the opposite. However, the pontiff’s mistakes are not limited to its causes. The war’s present dynamic, and particularly Ukraine’s problems on the frontline, stems from the fact that the western military-industrial complex, reviled by the pope, has done too little, not too much. Rather than the west’s defence industry fuelling war, Ukraine’s recent losses are due to a lack of manpower and especially a lack of weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion. Europe’s defence industry has not been put on a war footing (unlike Russia’s), while the US Congress still holds $60bn in military aid to Kyiv hostage to domestic political wrangling. There is nothing preordained in the war’s outcome, as the pope implies: if Ukraine is losing, it’s down to the fact that its artillery fire is a fraction of what it was last summer, and while the west dithers, Russia has replenished its military stocks and North Korea has sent Moscow roughly 1.5m shells. Ukraine needs weapons not “just” to defend its frontline, but also to protect the civilian population that should be dear to the pope. It’s thanks to western air defences that Ukraine can protect its citizens and civilian infrastructure across the country from Russian drone and missile strikes. It’s also thanks to western military capabilities that Ukraine has knocked out about a third of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, ensuring that grain can continue flowing to the global south, despite Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative last year. Looking to the future, the pope assumes that a Ukrainian surrender would put an end to the war, presumably via a deal allowing Russia to retain control of the five Ukrainian regions it has annexed illegally, and perhaps a few more (like Odesa). These are the kind of terms Donald Trump would probably also like to see. Of course, no one has a crystal ball. Yet if Putin’s past behaviour is any indication, there’s no evidence whatsoever to suggest this would represent a steady state ending the war. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion What the pope chooses to forget is that this is not the first war that Putin has waged in Europe, beginning with Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. Every time the west sidelined and played down the Russian threat, Moscow came back to bite off a bigger piece. Likewise, the pope neglects Russia’s military buildup, which European intelligence claims could pose a direct threat to Nato in a few years’ time. In short, even in the morally reprehensible scenario in which the pope’s words are heeded and the west throws Ukraine under the bus, all signals point to the fact that this would not lead to peace in Europe. More likely it would open up the continent to an even more dangerous and deadly phase of this unjust war.

"‘This music survived in a network of phones’: El Wali, the shapeshifting voice of Saharan struggle","Lying in a tent erected outside his house, Maulud Emhamed Sidi Bashir is listening to a small silver handheld radio. In the Sahrawi refugee camps near Tindouf in south-western Algeria, people often set up traditional tents like this on the doorsteps of newer buildings. The crackling electric guitar notes Bashir, 75, is listening to are a similar mix of traditional and modern. Many of the songs, his relatives say, are by a band called El Wali. It can take a while to figure out what, exactly, El Wali is. There is not much information on Google and only one album on YouTube (without the names of the singers or musicians). The very place where the band originated, the Western Sahara, is a question mark to most people. But El Wali has become a sort of national orchestra, a group whose songs don’t have credits and don’t belong to anybody; a shapeshifting entity that changes members over generations. Driving through the Hamada desert, Lud Mahmud, a member of the independence movement Polisario Front, tries to explain. He points to the camp spread across the flat rocky plain. “This is El Wali,” he says. A few kilometres later, at the next camp, he says again: “This is El Wali.” The concept is clear: everything is El Wali when it comes to Polisario music. Some members stay in the band longer than others, but there have been so many that each camp has certainly provided more than one. Situated between Morocco and Mauritania, this desert was a Spanish province – and one of the last European colonies in Africa – until 1975, when Spain handed it over to Morocco. The Western Sahara’s native people, the Sahrawis, were a mixture of nomadic tribes with almost no concept of nation before Morocco forced them from their land. In the late 1970s, they found refuge in south-western Algeria, where, unified by the common enemy, they laid the foundations of a new nation, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Led by the leftwing Polisario Front, they started a guerrilla war against Morocco that lasts to this day. The conflict has recently intensified, especially after the then-US President Donald Trump recognised Moroccan claims over the territory in 2020. Although largely forgotten by the international community, this is one of Africa’s longest wars and a continuing fight against colonisation (Western Sahara is considered by the UN a non-self-governing territory, essentially a colony of Morocco). Bashir and Mahmud were among the tens of thousands of people who had to leave their houses in Western Sahara and flee to the camps in Algeria, where the Polisario used music to help spark a national identity. Traditional poetry, infused with lyrics about the struggle against Morocco, was adapted into songs. The result was a stunning arrangement of western and local instruments played by a band that would soon take the name of El Wali. “I came from the bullets,” says Ahdaidhum Abaid Lagtab, a former member of El Wali, during a performance given by the current iteration of the band in the Sahrawi refugee camp of Laayoune. “I came in the middle of the occupation – and I remember the dead Sahrawis.” At the age of 16, Lagtab, like Bashir, escaped from the advance of the Moroccan army in the mid 1970s. “We didn’t sing about specific politics,” she adds, “but about society. We talked about freedom.” She joined El Wali in 1979, when the band was already active, with around a dozen members, and had taken the name of the co-founder and most famous martyr of the Polisario Front: El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed. With the look of a rock star and the charisma of Che Guevara, he galvanised the incipient nation before he was killed in 1976 aged about 28 during a raid. He is still the Sahrawis’ hero par excellence. Accustomed to a world of contracts and copyrights, breakups and reunions, we tend to frame a band in a definite space and time. For El Wali, this is not the case. “At the beginning, it was work for the nation, organised by the nation,” explains Salma Mohamed Said, AKA Shueta, a veteran singer and drummer who started with El Wali at its inception. “Each district would choose an artist to join the national band. Some would play traditional instruments, such as the drums. Others would play modern instruments, like the guitar and keyboard. The traditional balanced the modern.” Sitting in her living room, furnished with large carpets and cushions, Shueta remembers the 1980s and early 1990s with the band: “We played in concerts from Libya to South Africa, from Portugal to East Germany to North Korea.” In 1994, El Wali went to Belgium for a recording session organised by Oxfam. “I remember Shueta and the band,” says Hilt Teuwen, who managed the production. “I had met them in the camps and invited them to Belgium. The result was a very good quality recording.” This was a fabulous album called Tiris, 13 songs played with three singers, electric guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and tidinit, a traditional Sahrawi lute. It is a mix of joyful yet nostalgic tunes that tell the origins of the war against Morocco and the story of a people in exile dreaming of independence. “We kept in touch for a while, then the composition of the band changed – but El Wali as such still exists.” The world – or at least the west – would have probably lost track of Tiris if it wasn’t for a self-described “guerrilla ethnomusicologist” and producer from Oregon named Christopher Kirkley. Around 2009, Kirkley was touring the Sahel (a stretch of the southern Sahara) and west Africa to collect samples of local music for an album series called Music from Saharan Cellphones. “At that time,” he says, “the internet wasn’t very widespread in the region. But mobiles and Bluetooth were, and people used them to listen to and exchange music. The only way to get songs was to copy them from one phone to another. It was a network.” During his research, songs from El Wali kept popping up on memory cards and sims but Kirkley wasn’t aware of who the performers were at the time. “There wasn’t much information; they were often just titled Polisario.” According to Kirkley, Sahrawi music helped introduce the region to the electric guitar, which really took hold in west Africa in the 1990s. A lot of the better-known Tuareg guitar music – sometimes known as desert blues or Tuareg rock, played by the likes of Mdou Moctar and Grammy-nominated Tinariwen – was hugely influenced by Sahrawi guitar music. “Especially the upbeat and kind of reggae rhythm, those have an origin in Sahrawi music,” he says. “It was the definitive sound of Western Sahara.” After releasing Music from Saharan Cellphones Volume Two in 2012, he began an eight-year investigative journey to retrace the origins of those Sahrawi songs so in vogue on the region’s mobiles. Through people who were working in NGOs in Western Sahara, he got in touch with Sahrawi music producer Hamdi Salama, who introduced him to Ali Mohammed (the guitarist on El Wali’s Tiris), who told him about the recording session in Belgium with Oxfam. The studio engineer, Pierre Jonckheer, who recorded the album, happened to have a copy of Tiris on CD. “You couldn’t find any references to this CD anywhere in the world, it disappeared from the internet and any western media,” Kirkley says. “There is something fascinating in a music resonating and surviving on a network of phones. Without it, it probably wouldn’t ever have this second life.” In 2019, Kirkley and Salama rereleased El Wali’s Tiris, now available on Spotify and YouTube, where this whole story began. They are now working on a new release of music from the Sahrawi band. “The new album that we want to release was made by completely different people,” says Kirkley. “It’s confusing because you have to bring it to an audience and say: ‘Yes, this is also El Wali.’” Back in the desert, a large national parade is being held to mark the 50th anniversary of the Sahrawis’ struggle against occupation. The day is dominated by the military with armed vehicles carrying outdated rockets past onlookers who gather on top of cars under the punishing sun. The night, though, belongs to music. Shueta takes the stage, as she has many times before, to sing from exile. Much of the crowd is too young to ever have seen the homeland her lyrics speak of, but each strum of electric guitar carries with it the shimmering promise of a Sahrawi state and the unbroken music of El Wali.",2024-03-13T10:45:49Z,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/13/el-wali-the-shapeshifting-voice-of-saharan-struggle,The Guardian
Collapse at regional mine – as it happened,"Thank you for joining us on the live blog today – here is a wrap of the main news: Authorities are working to rescue two people trapped under rock after a collapse in a regional Victorian mine. Aerial searches will resume for seven people who are missing amid flooding in remote Western Australia after severe weather hampered efforts. The billionaire mining magnate Clive Palmer has vowed to build a vessel “far, far superior than the original” as he unveiled designs for his Titanic II project – again. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said Australia has been “mugged by reality” over the Aukus submarine deal after the US announced it will halve the number of submarines it will build next year. Four federal politicians have defended taxpayer-funded trips that allowed them to attend the 2022 Melbourne Cup, costing more than $5,000 in accommodation and transport. The lives of detainees in Australia’s immigration detention centres are controlled by a secret rating system that is opaque and often riddled with errors, a Guardian investigation has found. The minister responsible for Victoria’s Suburban Rail Loop cannot say how much the underground railway will cost, despite lashing an independent analysis that suggested building and running the first two stages will total more than $216bn. See you bright and early tomorrow. Search to resume for seven people missing in WA floods The search for seven missing people – including four children – in Western Australia will resume in the next two hours, after delays due to severe weather conditions. Two vehicles, a beige-coloured Toyota LandCruiser and a white Mitsubishi Triton, were believed to have left Kalgoorlie-Boulder on Sunday between 10am and 2pm, making for Tjuntjuntjara, police said on Tuesday. Both vehicles contained elderly drivers, with the Mitsubishi Triton also containing five other passengers, four of whom are children aged between seven and 17. WA police says its air wing and the local Kalgoorlie helicopter and air services have now been deployed to search the vast area between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Tjuntjuntjara, which are around 650km apart. The road between the two areas is still dangerous. Suburban Rail Loop minister rubbishes cost blowout report The minister responsible for Victoria’s Suburban Rail Loop cannot say how much the underground railway will cost, despite lashing an independent analysis that suggested building and running the first two stages will total more than $216bn. Analysis from Victoria’s Parliamentary Budget Office, prepared for the state’s opposition leader, John Pesutto, suggested that building the first two stages of the railway from Cheltenham to Box Hill and then on to Melbourne airport would cost $96.4bn. An additional $120.2bn would be required to operate the line for 50 years. This was $16.5bn more than was forecast by the PBO in 2022, and well above the $50bn the government said it would cost to construct the entire 90km underground railway when it announced the project in 2018. Here’s Pesutto: The Labor government told the Victorian people that the SRL would cost $50bn. We’re now seeing with each new report the cost continues to blow up. The sensible and responsible thing for the Allan Labor government is to stop this project urgently. To proceed stubbornly, hellbent on a project that just doesn’t stack up but will rack up the debt, is highly irresponsible. The Suburban Rail Loop minister, Danny Pearson, rubbished the costings and said the government was forging ahead: John Pesutto is making yet another tired, lazy attempt to discredit a project that Victorians have voted for at the last two previous elections. Two people have been trapped under rock after a collapse in a regional mine, the Victorian Country Fire Authority has confirmed. The CFA responded to a call at about 4.50pm that reported two people were trapped underground at the Indicator Lane mine at Mt Clear, Ballarat. Ambulance Victoria and Victoria police are also on scene. The mine at Mt Clear is a goldmine owned by Victory Minerals Pty Ltd. Super funds must demand Woodside and Santos abandon expansion plans, activists say Gas giants Woodside Energy and Santos make up a bigger share of the Australian share market than ever but are attracting a smaller proportion of superannuation savings than other large companies. As AAP reports, research released by Market Forces has found the biggest super funds are going cold on the two “climate wreckers” by dedicating a decreasing share of their members’ investments to them. The shareholder activist organisation is ramping up pressure on big carbon emitters and their stakeholders ahead of the next round of annual general meetings. Here’s the group’s campaigner, Brett Morgan: Super funds must demand and deliver an end to Woodside and Santos’s oil and gas expansion plans and publicly divest if they fail to comply. NSW calls on commonwealth to come to the table on school funding The New South Wales deputy premier and minister for education, Prue Car, has warned the commonwealth to come to the table on school funding lest her state feels it has been “forgotten”. Car said it was heartening to see the federal government’s decision to double public school funding in the Northern Territory, which would provide “extraordinary assistance” amid chronic resourcing issues. But she backed her counterparts in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania who have demanded a 5% increase to meet 100% of the schooling resource standard (SRS). In NSW, the commonwealth currently covers 20% of funding for public schools, while the state government is expanding its commitment to 75% by 2026, leaving a 5% gap. We are pushing for our relatively modest request … given yesterday’s decision by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to recommend a record cut in GST funding to NSW, coming to the table on public schools funding for NSW would be a good place for the commonwealth to start in reassuring the people of NSW that they have not forgotten the country’s largest state. NSW treasurer protests cut in GST revenue from federal government The NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, is continuing to complain about a cut in GST revenue that has made the state government’s surplus “virtually impossible”. On Tuesday, the commonwealth grants commission released its latest report on the carve-up of GST between the states and territories. Decisions of the independent commission are applied by the federal government as a matter of course, despite protests from states losing GST, which this year includes New South Wales and Queensland. Here’s what Mookhey told the ABC a few moments ago: I think we need an explanation from the federal government as to why New South Wales is losing out when it comes to infrastructure, why it’s losing out when it comes to health agreements, why it’s losing out when it comes to education agreements. The reason why we are speaking out about all this is because it does have very serious implications for our capacity to deliver services to the people of New South Wales. State education ministers say commonwealth should increasing public school funding Education ministers are standing firm that the commonwealth should front a 5% increase to public schools after the federal government sealed its second funding deal with the Northern Territory. Under the statements of intent, WA has agreed to a 2.5% commonwealth funding boost to reach the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS), while the NT will have its funding doubled to 40% due to the additional need. But Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales have resisted a 2.5% boost, instead demanding the federal government up its funding by 5% before they agree to their own increases. South Australia’s minister for education, Blair Boyer, said the state “deserves its fair share of funding” from the commonwealth. That’s what I’m fighting for with my colleagues from Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and the ACT. Public schools are for every child … these students deserve the right funding levels. $190m extra per year for public schools would be a gamechanger for SA. It would mean more support for students and more support for teachers. It will change lives. Queensland’s education minister, Di Farmer, said the NT deal demonstrated the commonwealth could break the previous government’s cap of allocating 20% of SRS funding to public schools. Queensland has a continued commitment that the federal government will provide a 5% increase to 25% so that all state schools in Queensland can achieve 100% funding. Tasmania’s minister for education, Roger Jaensch, similarly said the state’s position “has not changed”. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has rejected suggestions the Biden administration is “backsliding” on its commitment to provide nuclear submarines under the Aukus deal. The US has announced it will halve the number of submarines it will build next year, throwing the Australia end of the agreement into doubt. The Pentagon budget draft request includes construction of just one Virginia-class nuclear submarine for 2025. Marles has been speaking about this to the ABC: The fact that the American industrial base is stretched in 2024, as it was in 2023 when we made this announcement, is not news. It formed part of the landscape against which this arrangement was agreed a year ago. I think what’s important to see in the budget that’s been put forward by the Biden administration is an $11bn commitment over the next five years to grow the industrial capacity within the United States to produce Virginia-class submarines, which will see an increase over that time in the tempo of Virginia-class submarines produced. That’s what we need to see. That’s as expected. A Sunshine Coast man has been charged with 116 offences against multiple children, including rape, indecent treatment, stalking and taking a child for immoral purposes. Queensland police alleged the 31-year-old had been actively targeting minors online since August 2023. He was arrested in February by the child protection investigation unit (CPIU) and taken into custody. The man has been refused police bail and is due to reappear in Maroochydore magistrates court on 18 March. Under Queensland law, a person is guilty of taking a child for immoral purposes who “entices away or detains a child who is under the age of 16 years and is not the husband or wife of that person” for the purposes of intercourse or indecent treatment. Clive Palmer ‘sure’ high court challenge against electoral spending laws will be launched Mining billionaire and one-time federal MP Clive Palmer has said he’s “sure” that “someone” will mount a high court challenge against the federal government’s electoral spending laws. Palmer held a press conference in Sydney earlier today to re-announce his plans to build a true-to-life replica of the Titanic, where he fielded questions from journalists about his history of making lavish political donations. Palmer, who donated more than $110m to his United Australia Party before the last federal election, criticised Labor’s plan to limit the amount of money a donor can give to a political party. He said: I think that’s contrary to what the high court said about [the] implied right of political free speech in Australia. So I’m sure that will be challenged by someone in the high court. Not necessarily me, maybe, but I’m sure it will be. Asked if he was trying to intimidate the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, out of introducing the legislation, Palmer said: I don’t think you can intimidate someone as steely-eyed as Mr Albanese, someone as strong and full of his faculty, I couldn’t possibly intimidate him. The real question should be, is he trying to intimidate me? Is he trying to intimidate Australians? We know that what the Liberal party and the Labor party would like in this country is to have a monopoly on public debate. The Bureau of Meteorology is keeping a close eye on conditions to the north and west of the country.

As AAP reports, the 90km orbital rail line is Victoria’s most expensive infrastructure project, designed to run from Cheltenham in Victoria’s south-east to Werribee in the southwest via Melbourne Airport. The first two stages, SRL East and North, will cost an extra $9bn to build and maintain and $7.5bn to run over the next 50 years, according to Victoria’s independent Parliamentary Budget Office. The analysis, requested by the state opposition, is an update to its 2022 report that calculated construction and operational costs for the first two stages at $200bn.

Australians lost $15.9m to social media scams in three months, report says Consumer group Choice says urgent government action is needed after $15.9m was lost to social media scams in October to December last year, according to a National Anti-Scam Centre quarterly report. Choice argues that digital platforms should be forced to prevent scam losses. Their senior campaigns and policy advisor, Alex Soderlund, said it was “disappointing” platforms are “refusing to come to the table to stop scammers exploiting their tools”: From October to December last year, social media scams made up a huge 20% of losses for the quarter. In 2023, social media scam losses stole $95m, a 249% increase since 2020. 76% of 2023’s losses were through Meta-owned companies. We continue to see an overwhelming number of likely scam ads across Meta and Google-owned services. Big tech companies have a perverse incentive not to act on scams because they generate advertising revenue, so it’s clear that only strong mandatory rules to prevent scams developed and enforced by a regulator will result in any meaningful change for consumers. According to the report, a majority of the social media scams in 2023 occurred via Whatsapp (47% of losses), Facebook (20%), online dating sites (9%) and Instagram (9%). During the October to December period, people over 65 experienced the highest losses of any age group at 30% of all social media scam losses – a 57% increase compared to the previous quarter for this age group. Former US Marine Brian Earl Johnston has been sentenced to life in prison, with a non-parole period of 20 years, for the 2021 murder of his estranged wife, Kelly Wilkinson.The Queensland supreme court heard that Johnston “intended” to kill Wilkinson, and that he had gone to her home armed with weapons, duct tape, zip ties and a sedative. He was carrying a 20 litre can of petrol, which he poured on Wilkinson and set her on fire. Justice Peter Applegarth said: I find that you intended to kill her, and then kill yourself. Something you failed to achieve. Johnston was also sentenced to three years in prison for breaching a domestic violence protection order. Asbestos has been detected at two central Queensland facilities after a investigation by the state government. Queensland’s Department of Environment and innovation (DESI) confirmed asbestos was detected in a mulch stockpile at Emu Park transfer station after a joint inspection program by DESI and Workplace Health and Safety Queensland. Livingstone shire council has closed the station as a precaution while DESI investigates. The department said a small number of residents had picked up mulch from the transfer station over recent weeks. The contaminated material is believed to be bonded asbestos, which is less deadly than friable asbestos. Asbestos has also been detected at NuGrow Rockhampton. The department said the samples were not part of a stockpile and are not believed to have left the site. Saws down as Victoria’s forest logging firm gets the chop Victoria’s state-owned logging company will shut down within months, AAP reports. A 30 June end date was revealed this morning during a court hearing involving VicForests and environmental group Wombat Forestcare. The winding-up of the body is part of the Victorian government’s decision to end native forest logging, which took effect on 1 January. Stand-down payments to VicForests contractors are due to end on 30 June. The Victorian Greens’ deputy leader, Ellen Sandell, accused VicForests of being “environmental vandals” and said it was about time they were shut down: We now need Labor to focus its environment department on restoration and protection of our forests, with specialised staff who have these skills.",2024-03-13T07:19:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/mar/13/australia-news-live-china-tariffs-wine-wa-floods-suv-car-parking-yarra-anthony-albanese-penny-wong-ntwnfb,The Guardian
Birdwatch: rare black-faced spoonbill turns up in Hong Kong wetland,"I opened the windows to the hide and was greeted by a mass of birds. Hundreds of cormorants, gulls, herons, egrets, ducks and waders, all feeding frantically as the rising tide covered up the fertile mud. Overhead, black kites patrolled half-heartedly, occasionally provoking the other birds to take to the wing in short-lived panic, before settling back down to feed or rest. I witnessed this spectacle at the World Wide Fund for Nature’s Mai Po nature reserve in Hong Kong, justly celebrated as one of the most important wetlands in the world. Either side of high tide, birds gather here in vast numbers against the backdrop of Shenzhen, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, just across the border in mainland China. Among the commoner species I spotted a spoonbill, but not the version I am familiar with. As it fed, sweeping its curious, spatulate bill from side to side in the shallow waters, I could see a distinctive dark face, contrasting with its white plumage, which marked this bird out as something different. The black-faced spoonbill is by far the rarest member of its family, with fewer than 6,000 individuals on the planet. Soon it will head back north to the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea where it can breed undisturbed. Hopefully, next autumn, it will return to Mai Po, a welcome haven in a world where wetland habitats are under constant threat.",2024-03-13T06:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/13/birdwatch-rare-black-faced-spoonbill-turns-up-in-hong-kong-wetland,The Guardian
Robert Hur says he ‘did not exonerate’ Biden and refuses to rule out role in a Trump administration – as it happened,"In his opening statement, former special counsel Robert Hur defended his descriptions of Joe Biden’s memory and its relevance in his report as “necessary, accurate and fair”. Hur said: There has been a lot of attention paid to language in the report about the president’s memory, so let me say a few words about that. My task was to determine whether the president retained or disclosed national defense information “willfully” – meaning, knowingly and with the intent to do something the law forbids. I could not make that determination without assessing the president’s state of mind. Hur said that for that reason, he had to “consider the president’s memory and overall mental state, and how a jury likely would perceive his memory and mental state in a criminal trial”. He added: My assessment in the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair. Most importantly, what I wrote is what I believe the evidence shows, and what I expect jurors would perceive and believe. I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the president unfairly. I explained to the attorney general my decision and the reasons for it. That’s what I was required to do. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Robert Hur, the justice department special counsel assigned to report on Joe Biden’s possession of classified documents, told Congress he was just doing his job when he shook up the US election campaign by criticizing the president’s apparent inability to recall certain events. In his opening statement, Hur defended his descriptions of Biden’s memory issues and the relevance of them to his investigation and in his report as “necessary, accurate and fair”. Appearing before the House judiciary committee, Hur said his investigation into Biden “did not exonerate” the president despite declining to charge him. Hur declined to rule out accepting a role in a potential second Trump administration. Hur was appointed as a US attorney by Donald Trump in 2017. A transcript of Hur’s interview with Biden shows the president repeatedly said he never meant to retain classified information after he left the vice-presidency, but he was at times fuzzy about dates and said he was unfamiliar with the paper trail for some of the sensitive documents he handled. Ken Buck, the hard-right Republican congressman of Colorado, announced he will leave Congress at the end of next week, putting the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House in further jeopardy. The Pentagon will send a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $300m, the White House announced, the first such move in months as fresh funds for weapons have stalled in the House because of Republican opposition. The White House’s announcement that the US will send a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $300m marks the first such move in months as fresh funds for weapons have stalled in the House because of Republican opposition. It comes as Ukraine is running dangerously low on munitions, and after months of statements from US officials that the it wouldn’t be able to resume weapons deliveries until Congress provided the additional replenishment funds. The aid announcement comes as Polish leaders are in Washington to press the US to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, met on Tuesday with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate and was to meet with Joe Biden later in the day. Donald Trump’s second White House chief of staff tried to stop him from praising Adolf Hitler in part by trying to convince the then president that Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist dictator, was “a great guy in comparison”. “He said, ‘Well, but Hitler did some good things,’” the retired marine general John Kelly told Jim Sciutto of CNN in an interview for a new book. I said, ‘Well, what?’ And he said, ‘Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.’ But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said, ‘Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing. I mean, Mussolini was a great guy in comparison.’ Kelly, a retired US Marine Corps general, was homeland security secretary in the Trump administration before becoming Trump’s second chief of staff. Resigning at the end of 2018, he eventually became a public opponent of his former boss. Kelly told Sciutto it was “pretty hard to believe” Trump “missed the Holocaust” in his assessment of Hitler, “and pretty hard to understand how he missed the 400,000 American GIs that were killed in the European theatre” of the second world war. But I think it’s more … the tough guy thing.” Trump’s liking for authoritarian leaders, in particular Vladimir Putin of Russia, is well known. His remarks to Kelly about Hitler – like his former practice of keeping a book of Hitler’s speeches by his bed – have been reported before. The Biden campaign is feeling good about Robert Hur’s testimony before the House judiciary committee today, a campaign official has told CNN. After nearly five hours, the House judiciary committee has adjourned its meeting and former special counsel Robert Hur has been released. Reaction is coming in to the announcement that Colorado Republican representative Ken Buck is leaving Congress before the end of the month. One GOP-er called it “alarming”. GOP Rep. Pat Fallon reacts to Ken Buck leaving Congress next week: “Very surprising. Very disturbing. Very alarming. Very concerning.”Meanwhile, a Democratic operative texts this: pic.twitter.com/1oA1oRfrrT Buck announced last November that he wouldn’t stand for re-election but gave no indication then that he would leave before the end of his term. He cited the dysfunction of Congress in general but also slammed the Republican party as it “continues to rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen” by Joe Biden from Donald Trump. Buck is currently questioning Robert Hur in the judiciary committee hearing. Rep. Ken Buck “I think this place is dysfunctional...Instead of operating in a professional manner, this place has devolved into this bickering and nonsense and not really doing the job for the American people.” pic.twitter.com/VWoHGF5PkR The House judiciary committee hearing has resumed in the questioning of now-former special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Joe Biden’s having kept hold of classified documents after he left office as the US vice-president. Hur concluded that the US president should not be punished, which enraged Republicans, but justified that decision by saying, essentially, that a jury would find Biden too forgetful, because of his age, to be able to conclude that he committed a crime. “I stand by every word in the document,” Hur said in testimony at the hearing. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the fresh consignment of $300m of weapons that the US is dispatching to Ukraine won’t last long. The weaponry including artillery ammunition will “maybe only last for a couple of weeks”, Sullivan said during a media briefing at the White House. Meanwhile, the outgoing Senate minority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, has just urged the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, to hold a vote in the lower chamber on the stalled bill that supplies new aid to US allies Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Reuters reports. The US Senate gave final approval to a $95bn wartime aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, including Taiwan, last month and sent the bill to the Republican-controlled House, where it screeched to a halt amid rightwing opposition. Sullivan has left the west wing briefing room now and White House the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, is answering questions that focus more on US domestic topics. The Pentagon will rush about $300m in weapons to Ukraine after finding some cost savings in its contracts, the Associated Press reports. The relatively small input will happen even though the US military remains deeply overdrawn and needs at least $10bn to replenish all the weapons it has pulled from its stocks to help Kyiv in its desperate fight against Russia, the White House announced a little earlier.It’s the Pentagon’s first announced security package for Ukraine since December, when it acknowledged it was out of replenishment funds. It wasn’t until recent days that officials publicly acknowledged they weren’t just out of replenishment funds, but overdrawn. The announcement comes as Ukraine is running dangerously low on munitions and efforts to get fresh funds for weapons have stalled in the House because of Republican opposition. US officials have insisted for months that the United States wouldn’t be able to resume weapons deliveries until Congress provided additional replenishment funds, which are part of a large supplemental package stalled in Congress. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, in announcing the $300m in additional aid: When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back. The aid announcement comes as Polish leaders are in Washington to press the US to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, met on Tuesday with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate and was to meet with Joe Biden later in the day.The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, has so far refused to bring the $95bn package, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, to the floor. Republican congressman Ken Buck of Colorado is leaving Congress short of his elected term, he announced within the last half hour. Buck is a hard-right representative. He had already announced that he would not seek re-election but now he’s leaving much sooner, putting the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House in further jeopardy. Here’s the congressman’s post on X/Twitter: Statement from Congressman Ken Buck on his departure from Congress. pic.twitter.com/orjSzenZnv The congressional hearing for former special counsel Robert Hur to be questioned about his report into Joe Biden’s retention of classified documents after leaving the vice-presidency has taken a recess for lunch. There are some unrelated votes to be taken in the House and the hearing will resume after those this afternoon but without an exact time given. Here’s where things stand: National security adviser Jake Sullivan is now briefing the media in the west wing, and will be followed by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. We’ll bring you highlights. Robert Hur declined to engage in Republicans’ questions at the hearing in front of the House judiciary committee about whether Joe Biden is “senile”. Asked whether he found that Biden was senile, after interviewing the US president at length about how he hung on to classified documents after his vice-presidency, Hur said: “I did not. That conclusion does not appear in my report.” Hur said he “did not exonerate” Biden in his report. Hur interrupted Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat congresswoman from Washington, when she said Hur’s report amounted to a “complete exoneration” of the president. Hur shot back: “I did not exonerate him. That word does not appear in my report.” Hur declined to rule out accepting a role in a potential second Trump administration. Hur was appointed as a US attorney by Donald Trump in 2017. Trump is running for re-election to a second term as a Republican president. In his opening statement, Hur defended his descriptions of Joe Biden’s memory issues and the relevance of them to his investigation and in his report as “necessary, accurate and fair”. Hur is testifying before the House judiciary committee as a private citizen after leaving the justice department. According to a report by the Independent, Hur arranged his departure from the justice department to be official as of Monday, 11 March. Jerry Nadler, the Democrat House judiciary committee ranking member, began his opening statement at the hearing by saying that House Republicans are “desperate to convince America that white conservative men are on the losing end of a two-tiered justice system, a theory … that has no basis in reality”. Nadler opined that Biden “probably committed a verbal slip or two” in his interviews with Hur.",2024-03-12T20:03:59Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/mar/12/biden-classified-documents-robert-hur-testify-latest-updates,The Guardian
Russia-Ukraine war: Russian schools in Kursk close after claims of Ukrainian cross-border incursion – as it happened,"Schools in the Russian city of Kursk are switching to online classes after an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the region, the TASS news agency cited local authorities as saying. Ukraine-based armed groups claimed on Tuesday they had crossed the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, while Russia said it had prevented such incursions. The Kursk region also came under attack from Ukrainian drones overnight. Here are all the key developments in the Russia-Ukraine war today: Schools in the Russian city of Kursk are switching to online classes, local authorities said, after an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the region. Ukraine pounded targets in Russia with dozens of drones and rockets in a sweeping attack that inflicted serious damage on a major oil refinery and sought to pierce the land borders of the world’s biggest nuclear power with armed proxies. Russia said its forces prevented incursions from Ukraine on Tuesday and inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, after Ukraine-based armed groups said they had launched cross-border raids. French President Emmanuel Macron’s Ukraine strategy will be put to a symbolic vote in parliament’s lower house on Tuesday as political tensions rage in the run-up to June’s European Parliament elections. Denmark will provide a new military aid package including Caesar artillery systems and ammunition to Ukraine worth around 2.3 billion Danish crowns ($336.6 million). The United States is preparing a new military aid package for Ukraine that could be worth as much as $400 million, two US officials told Reuters. European Union countries are set to agree on a new 5 billion euro ($5.46 billion) top-up to a fund used to finance military shipments to Ukraine, the Financial Times reported. Thanks for following. I’m closing the blog for the rest of the day, but we will reopen it tomorrow morning. European Union countries are set to agree on a new 5 billion euro ($5.46 billion) top-up to a fund used to finance military shipments to Ukraine, the Financial Times has reported, citing four officials briefed on the discussions. Ukrainian Security Service said on Tuesday it has uncovered one of the largest networks in the country allegedly spreading pro-Russian “informational sabotage”, coordinated by a cleric of the minority Moscow-linked church. Reuters reports: Kyiv officials said Moscow planned to step up its informational war this spring, spreading disinformation in an attempt to divide Ukrainian society in the third year of its invasion. The SBU agency said it has exposed 15 members of the network linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), detaining four of them, including the cleric of a Kyiv-based temple of the minority Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). SBU said on its Telegram channel.: It is one of the largest FSB networks that has been operating in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The group was involved in spreading pro-Kremlin narratives aimed at destabilising society and inciting religious hatred, according to the agency. The church describes itself as independent, saying it cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, which supports Moscow’s war in Ukraine. A government commission has ruled that the church is still canonically linked to Russia. The international Red Cross movement is under pressure to take action against the Russian Red Cross (RRC) over close links between the group and the Kremlin’s war and propaganda machine, The Guardian’s central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker writes. The evidence includes the RRC president’s central role in a pro-Putin “patriotic” organisation, senior RRC staff who speak of the impossibility of peace with “Ukrainian Nazis”, and RRC participation in military training for children. There are also allegations, revealed in leaked Kremlin documents obtained by the Estonian publication Delfi and shared with a consortium of outlets including the Guardian, that the Kremlin plans to replace the work of the international Red Cross on Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine by funding new, puppet Red Cross organisations. n response to the previous publication of some of these allegations, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) said it was “reviewing the claims closely”. It is now under pressure from donor governments to take action against the RRC. The United States is preparing a new military aid package for Ukraine that could be worth as much as $400 million, two US officials have told Reuters. This would be the first such move in months as additional funds for Kyiv remain blocked by Republican leaders in Congress. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an announcement was expected later on Tuesday. One of the officials said that the funding for this package is from credits refunded to the Pentagon for recent purchases. Separately, leaders of US intelligence agencies urgently pressed members of the House of Representatives on Tuesday to approve additional military assistance for Ukraine, saying it would not only boost Kyiv as it fights Russia but discourage Chinese aggression. CIA Director Williams Burns told the House of Representatives’ Intelligence committee’s annual hearing on Worldwide Threats to US security: That has consequences for American interests that go ... directly to our interests in the Indo-Pacific. That kind of an outcome will stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership, and they’re going to undermine the faith that our partners and allies in the Indo Pacific have in our reliability. Russia’s elite is expecting President Vladimir Putin to reshuffle government positions to bring in younger people after what it sees as the formality of his resounding election victory this weekend, four sources close to the authorities have told Reuters. In control of all state levers and with no serious political competitors, Putin - in power as president or prime minister since the last day of 1999 - is widely expected to win what will be his fifth presidential term and another six years in power. The four sources, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject, said they expected younger people to be brought into more senior government positions, including perhaps as deputy ministers and heads of ministerial departments, and for an older generation of government officials to be demoted or retire after the election. One of the sources said ministerial portfolios were being reviewed too and that the reshuffle was expected to take place in May. Changes at major state corporations, state energy behemoths and in Russia’s more than 80 regional governorships are also seen as possible, the sources said. The Kremlin says it never comments on planned personnel changes ahead of time. At a time when Russia is waging war with Ukraine and needs continuity, two of the sources said they did not expect Putin to change his defence and foreign ministers, however. “You don’t change horses mid-stream,” said the first source, who added that it would be surprising if Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, 68, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who turns 74 later this month, did not keep their posts. In office since 2020, Mikhail Mishustin, the 58-year-old technocratic prime minister, is also expected to keep his job, they said. So is Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, three sources said. Planned changes at the top of major ministries and in security agencies will only take place after the end of what Putin calls his special military operation in Ukraine, the first source said. Denmark will provide a new military aid package including Caesar artillery systems and ammunition to Ukraine worth around 2.3 billion Danish crowns ($336.6 million), the Danish Defence Ministry has said in a statement. In Russia, Tass has reported that the foreign ministry has imposed sanctions on 347 people from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia which it claims are “hostile figures”. Tass quotes the ministry claiming: The hostile policy of the Baltic states towards Russia, active lobbying by Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia for sanctions measures against our country, interference in the internal affairs of Russia, persecution of the Russian-speaking population, a barbaric campaign for the mass demolition of monuments to Soviet liberating soldiers, rewriting history, glorifying Nazism, as well as the criminal line pursued to pump the Kyiv regime with weapons require retaliatory measures against those involved in these atrocities. Germany’s military still lacks sufficient equipment and personnel despite a €100bn (£85bn / $109bn) special fund set up after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces said on Tuesday. Reuters reports Eva Högl said “Despite the remarkable efforts, it remains to be said that substantial improvements in personnel, equipment and infrastructure are still a long way off.” Germany is in the second year of the “Zeitenwende” policy, announced by chancellor Olaf Scholz just days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It is designed to deliver a more assertive foreign policy backed by more military spending. Here are the latest images coming out of Belgorod, Russia, which according to local authorities was hit by Ukrainian drones this morning. Here are the key developments from the day so far: Schools in the Russian city of Kursk are switching to online classes, local authorities said, after an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the region. Ukraine pounded targets in Russia with dozens of drones and rockets in a sweeping attack that inflicted serious damage on a major oil refinery and sought to pierce the land borders of the world’s biggest nuclear power with armed proxies.

Ukraine-based armed groups claimed on Tuesday they had crossed the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, while Russia said it had prevented such incursions. The Kursk region also came under attack from Ukrainian drones overnight. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned Switzerland’s ambassador over the Swiss parliament’s approval of motions authorising the government to work on a way to seize and transfer Russian assets to fund reparations for Ukraine. Russia summoned Ambassador Krystyna Marty Lang to protest at the narrowly passed Swiss motions which authorised the Swiss government to work on creating a reparations mechanism in international law for a country illegally attacked. The foreign ministry said: Russia strongly condemns this step by the Swiss authorities that grossly violates the fundamental principles and norms of international law regarding state immunity. Any encroachment on Russian state property under the guise of any far-fetched ‘reparative mechanism’ would be nothing more than theft at the state level. The ministry said Russia would retaliate if the Swiss plan was implemented. The Swiss foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Switzerland said last year that it had frozen an estimated 7.7 billion Swiss francs ($8.81 billion) in financial assets belonging to Russians under sanctions designed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that Russian forces have taken control of the village of Nevelske in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, the RIA news agency reported. A Russian Il-76 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo region northeast of Moscow on Tuesday with 15 people on board, the Interfax news agency cited Russia’s defence ministry as saying. Another agency, TASS, cited the ministry as saying one of the plane’s engines had caught fire, causing the crash. It was unclear whether there were any survivors. Reuters has the full report on the drone strikes: Ukraine pounded targets in Russia on Tuesday with dozens of drones and rockets in a sweeping attack that inflicted serious damage on a major oil refinery and sought to pierce the land borders of the world’s biggest nuclear power with armed proxies. Russia and Ukraine have both used drones to strike critical infrastructure, military installations and troop concentrations in their more than two-year war, with Kyiv hitting Russian refineries and energy facilities in recent months. Russia said Ukrainian proxies had sought to cross the Russian border in at least seven attacks which Russian forces had repelled. The Russian-speaking Ukrainian proxies said they had breached the border, a claim denied by Russia. In one of the biggest Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia to date, Russia said it had downed 25 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions including Moscow, Leningrad, Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Tula and Oryol. Many more drone attacks were reported. Russian officials reported attacks on a slew of energy facilities, including a fire at Lukoil’s LKOH.MM NORSI refinery and a drone destroyed on the outskirts of the town of Kirishi, home to Russia’s second largest oil refinery. Gleb Nikitin, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, posted a picture of a fire truck beside the NORSI refinery and said emergency services were working to put out a blaze there. He said on Telegram: A fuel and energy complex facility was attacked by unmanned aerial vehicles. Industry sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the main crude distillation unit (AVT-6) at NORSI was damaged in the attack, which means that at least half of the refinery’s production is halted. Lukoil declined to comment. NORSI refines about 15.8 million tonnes of Russian crude a year, or 5.8% of total refined crude, according to industry sources. Striking Russian oil facilities is a problem for President Vladimir Putin as he faces off against the West over Ukraine, with domestic gasoline prices sensitive ahead of a March 15-17 presidential election. The Kremlin said the Russian military was doing everything necessary and that what it calls its military operation in Ukraine would continue. European Union leaders are ready to respond with new and significant measures against Iran amid reports that Tehran may transfer ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, draft conclusions of a summit to be held next week said. The draft text, seen by Reuters, said: The European Council calls on third parties to immediately cease providing material support to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Reports that Iran may transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine are very concerning. The European Union is prepared to respond swiftly and in coordination with international partners, including with new and significant measures against Iran. Iran has provided Russia with a large number of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, six sources told Reuters, deepening the military cooperation between the two countries, which are both under US sanctions. The conclusions also said the leaders would call on High Representative Josep Borrell and the Commission to prepare further sanctions against Belarus, North Korea and Iran.",2024-03-12T15:56:33Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-latest-news-updates,The Guardian
Aide tried to stop Trump praising Hitler – by telling him Mussolini was ‘great guy’,"Donald Trump’s second White House chief of staff tried to stop him praising Adolf Hitler in part by trying to convince the then president that Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist dictator, was “a great guy in comparison”. “He said, ‘Well, but Hitler did some good things,’” the retired marine general John Kelly told Jim Sciutto of CNN in an interview for a new book. “I said, ‘Well, what?’ And he said, ‘Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.’ But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said, ‘Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing. I mean, Mussolini was a great guy in comparison.” Kelly, a retired US Marine Corps general, was homeland security secretary in the Trump administration before becoming Trump’s second chief of staff. Resigning at the end of 2018, he eventually became a public opponent of his former boss. Sciutto is a CNN anchor and national security analyst. His new book, The Return of Great Powers, will be published on Tuesday. CNN published a preview on Monday. Kelly told Sciutto it was “pretty hard to believe” Trump “missed the Holocaust” in his assessment of Hitler, “and pretty hard to understand how he missed the 400,000 American GIs that were killed in the European theatre” of the second world war. “But I think it’s more … the tough guy thing.” Trump’s liking for authoritarian leaders, in particular Vladimir Putin of Russia, is well known. His remarks to Kelly about Hitler – like his former practice of keeping a book of Hitler’s speeches by his bed – have been reported before. But Sciutto’s recounting of his conversation with Kelly comes amid resurgent fears over Trump’s authoritarian leanings, with Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee despite facing 91 criminal charges and multimillion-dollar civil defeats, and having seen off attempts to disqualify him for office. Kelly’s remarks to Sciutto were published shortly after Trump welcomed to his Florida home Viktor Orbán, the strongman leader of Hungary. Singing Trump’s praises, Orbán said that if Trump defeats Joe Biden for re-election, the US would not “give a penny” more in aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders. Kelly told Sciutto Trump “thought Putin was an OK guy and Kim [Jong-un] was an OK guy … to him, it was like we were goading these guys. ‘If we didn’t have Nato, then Putin wouldn’t be doing these things.’” Trump recently said that if re-elected, he will encourage Russia to attack Nato members Trump deems not to pay enough into the alliance. Condemning those remarks as “dumb, shameful and un-American”, Biden has sought to portray Trump as a threat to world security as well as US democracy. Kelly told Sciutto: “The point is, [Trump] saw absolutely no point in Nato. He was [also] just dead set against having troops in South Korea, again, a deterrent force, or having troops in Japan, a deterrent force” to North Korea. Kelly was not the only general to fill a civil role in Trump’s administration. James Mattis, also a marine, was Trump’s first secretary of defense while HR McMaster, from the army, was Trump’s second national security adviser. Kelly told Sciutto Trump thought US generals would prove as loyal to him as German generals did to Hitler. “He would ask about the loyalty issues,” Kelly said, but “when I pointed out to him the German generals as a group were not loyal to [Hitler], and in fact tried to assassinate him a few times, he didn’t know that. “He truly believed, when he brought us generals in, that we would be loyal – that we would do anything he wanted us to do.” A Trump spokesperson told CNN Kelly had “beclowned” himself and should “seek professional help”. Kelly said: “My theory on why [Trump] likes the dictators so much is that’s who he is. “Every incoming president is shocked that they actually have so little power without going to the Congress, which is a good thing. It’s civics 101, separation of powers, three equal branches of government. “But in his case, he was shocked that he didn’t have dictatorial-type powers to send US forces places or to move money around within the budget. And he looked at Putin and Xi [Jinping, of China] and that nutcase in North Korea as people who were like him in terms of being a tough guy.” On Tuesday, the Biden campaign responded to Kelly’s remarks. A spokesperson, Sarafina Chitika, said: “Donald Trump’s praise for Hitler is disgraceful but wholly unsurprising from the man who has parroted Nazi rhetoric on the campaign trail, called his political opponents ‘vermin’, and sucked up to dictators and authoritarians like Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orbán, Kim Jong-un, and the rest of the gang. “When Donald Trump talks like a dictator, praises dictators, and says he wants to be a dictator, we should probably believe him.”",2024-03-12T14:42:53Z,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/12/mussolini-trump-hitler-john-kelly-jim-sciutto-book,The Guardian
The global outlook is perilous. But here are three things Labour can do to make the world a safer place | Simon Tisdall,"An incoming Labour government will face a daunting array of foreign and defence policy challenges, many of which are beyond the ability of any one country to resolve. Willingness to engage in multilateral, cooperative approaches to common problems – and unstinting support for the UN charter – must be guiding principles. Immediate challenges include the foreign and domestic ramifications of the wars in Ukraine and Palestine, and the prospect of a new rightwing US administration. If a re-elected Donald Trump broke with Europe and Nato and dissolved the “special relationship”, Britain could be dangerously isolated, considering it is already divorced from Europe. Longer-term challenges include vexed efforts to tackle the climate crisis, food insecurity, mass migration and political instability; poverty, protectionism, and debt relief; the rise of China and similar authoritarian, anti-democratic regimes; the deteriorating global security situation; disrespect for international law and human rights; and AI and cyberterrorism. Here are three priority policy areas where a Labour government could demonstrate global leadership and make a positive difference. The proliferation of nuclear weapons poses an existential threat to humankind and is accelerating around the world. There are nine nuclear weapon states, ranked by total number of warheads: Russia, the US, China, France, the UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. In addition, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Belarus “host” nuclear bombs. Other countries, for example Iran, Saudi Arabia and Japan, either have, or might quickly acquire, the ability to build nuclear weapons. Most nuclear weapon states are expanding or updating their arsenals. The development of smaller, low-yield “battlefield” nukes and drone delivery systems is raising the risk of nuclear warfare. Labour should set an example by drastically lowering the total number of UK nuclear warheads in line with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It should announce its intention to phase out Britain’s unaffordable, US-supervised Trident at-sea ballistic missile deterrent. The UK should join other Nato countries in developing a common European defensive nuclear shield while prioritising global disarmament. Labour should launch a drive to maximise Britain’s ability to influence world affairs and international public opinion through the imaginative use of non-military soft power tools – a more effective form of defence than building sitting-duck aircraft carriers or firing off missiles at Houthis at America’s behest. It should immediately reverse the cuts to the overseas aid and development budget imposed by Boris Johnson’s government in 2020 and restore the target spend to at least 0.7% of gross national income. Foreign aid saves and builds lives. It is an invaluable means of promoting British values and democratic standards. Labour should make it easier for foreign nationals to study at British universities. Funding for the British Council’s worldwide work in education, cultural outreach and English language teaching should rise. Likewise, the BBC World Service should be cherished – and adequately resourced. BBC Arabic and BBC Persian are closing down. That’s plain crazy. The 2020 merger of the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development was a destructive act that should be unpicked. UK diplomacy has suffered damaging cutbacks and appalling leadership in recent years. Labour should recruit a new generation of diplomats with an ambitious brief to boost UK interests and leverage, build international coalitions, and assist in conflict resolution. Membership of the EU maximised Britain’s soft power through close association with 27 mostly likeminded countries. Labour must be candid about the huge damage done by Brexit, do everything possible to repair and strengthen UK-EU ties, and bury silly Tory ideas about Global Britain’s “tilt to Asia”. Unlike the US, Britain maintains full diplomatic relations with Iran and can draw on long-established institutional knowledge of the country. Labour should use this traditional engagement to restart the dialogue with Iran’s leadership that was fatally undermined by Trump. Improved western relations with Tehran, arguably the leading regional power, are the key to a safer, less volatile Middle East – and to reducing Islamophobic and antisemitic spillovers in Britain. Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen are all countries where Iran wields significant influence. Less confrontational policies and careful diplomacy could deliver more productive relationships. Resuming talks on limiting Iran’s nuclear arms-related capabilities in return for lifting sanctions would be a confidence-building start. Yet Labour’s larger aim should be to enlist Iran’s help in resolving the Israel-Gaza conflict and turning dreams of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state into reality. A Labour government should immediately offer diplomatic recognition to the state of Palestine while pushing for meaningful democratic reform of the Palestinian Authority. It should increase UK financial support, including resumed funding of the UN’s aid agency in Gaza. Labour must tell Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, if it is still in office, that bilateral relations will suffer serious consequences if Israel continues to try to veto the two-state solution the world wants.

Aged care report released – as it happened,"Thank you for joining us on the live blog today – hear is a wrap of the main news: Police hold “serious concerns” for seven people – including four children – who are missing in Western Australia, which has recorded heavy rainfall and flooding. Older farmers are leading an attack on practices used by the major supermarkets that they say are sending the fruit and vegetable industry broke. Labor’s longest serving foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has urged the Australian government to “get off the fence” and immediately reinstate funding to a key UN agency to help avert mass starvation in Gaza. Older Australians with more wealth should have to pay more for the cost of their aged care, a government-appointed expert panel has recommended, potentially from their superannuation balances. Western Australia will receive $6.2bn more GST this year as a result of a Turnbull-government era deal backed by Labor, triggering $5.2bn in payments to other states to ensure they are no worse off. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi will be able to use statements from X users on how a tweet by Pauline Hanson made them feel, as well as examples of alleged racially charged statements from Hanson’s 30-year political career, in her racial vilification case against the One Nation leader. A man has been charged with murder after being accused of a fatal stabbing in a Gold Coast shopping centre car park. Thanks for sticking with us today. We’ll be back with you, bright and early, tomorrow. Western Australia police have provided an update on the seven people – including four children – who have been missing since Sunday. According to police, two vehicles left Kalgoorlie Boulder on Sunday between 10am and 2pm. Officers believe the group were returning to the remote community, Tjuntjuntjarra, 650km north-east of Kalgoorlie. The force’s Mick Kelly said police believe the seven people are family members and members of the Tjuntjuntjarra community: Concerns are held due to the fact that we’ve had severe weather and rain and more has been forecasted over the next 24 hours. We are unsure of what food and water resources they have on board. These are local members of the community of Tjuntjuntjarra and we are actively trying to communicate these people. Kelly said efforts to find the group have been affected by the weather conditions. The group were travelling on an unsealed track. A helicopter search for the group was abandoned earlier today due to poor visibility. Western Australia police has serious concerns for seven people – including four children – who are missing in a remote and flood-affected region of the state. According to police, two vehicles left Kalgoorlie Boulder on Sunday between 10am and 2pm. Officers believe they were travelling to Tjuntjuntjarra, 650km north-east of Kalgoorlie. Here’s the statement from police: The first vehicle is a beige coloured Toyota Landcruiser registration number ‘A683’, which is believed to contain an elderly driver. The second vehicle is a white Mitsubishi Triton registration number ‘KBC8881’, which is believed to contain an elderly driver and five other occupants of which four are children aged between 7-17 years. Concerns are held for the occupants of these two vehicles due to serious weather conditions. It is unknown how much food and water the occupants have in their possession. As my colleague Mostafa Rachwani pointed out a few moments ago, the state has experienced heavy rain and flooding in recent days. Land routes into WA remain cut off due to rain Heavy rain and flooding has cut off road and rail links into Western Australia. The Eyre Highway has been closed since the weekend and is likely to remain out of operation for several days. The Trans-Australian Railway line has also been affected, with key freight routes running between WA and South Australia through the Nullarbor closed amid the rain. Parts of WA experienced more than half a year’s rain in 24 hours over the weekend, with more than 155mm of rain recorded at Rawlinna, 900km east of Perth, since 9am Friday. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast totals of up to 130mm for parts of the Goldfields, Eucla and south interior districts on Tuesday. Christmas Island is being battered with heavy rain and strong winds, and could be facing a tropical cyclone in coming days. Will Parker from WeXplore Travel sent this video to Guardian Australia, showing some of the weather chaos. Matildas sell out again Australia’s love for the Matildas shows no signs of abating, with their next home game against China in May selling out in a matter of hours. The match against the world No 19 team is one of two farewell friendlies the Matildas will play before kicking off their Olympic campaign in Paris. The fixture at the 53,500-capacity Adelaide Oval will mark the 13th consecutive sellout crowd for the team and one million fans through the gates since 2017. 1️⃣,0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣,0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ fans through the gates!South Australia’s iconic Adelaide Oval is on the brink of making history as it prepares to welcome the one-millionth person to watch us play at home since 2017! 🇦🇺 v 🇨🇳 31.05.24 - @TheAdelaideOval#Matildas #TilitsDone The Football Australia (FA) boss, James Johnson, said the unprecedented demand was “a testament to the growing popularity and support for football in Australia”. We are confident that the upcoming matches for both the CommBank Matildas and the Subway Socceroos will continue to draw full stadiums, reaffirming the strong connection between our teams and their supporters. FA said a limited number of tickets for the Adelaide game may be released closer to the date, while tickets for the second friendly against China in Sydney on 3 June go on sale from this Friday. Tasmanian Labor leader reiterates support for AFL team Tasmanian Labor leader, Rebecca White, has sought to make it clear the state’s proposed AFL team would not be at risk if she is elected later this month. The proposed AFL stadium at Macquarie Point has been a controversial issue in Tasmania, with the issue featuring in debate ahead of the election on 23 March. Here’s what White told the ABC a few moments ago: The team is not in jeopardy under a Labor government. I grew up around regional football. It has been a part of my life forever and I support us getting our own team. We have been very clear that what we want to do is sit down with the AFL and make sure we have a great deal for Tassie, which hasn’t been delivered so far. I take on face value the fact they will work with us, if we are elected to government. There is no risk to the Tasmanian team. Bob Katter clashes with fellow MP Ross Cadell over supermarket inquiry The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, says Ross Cadell should not be removed from a Senate inquiry into supermarket pricing. Independent MP Bob Katter has demanded Cadell be replaced on the committee after the pair clashed at a press conference earlier today. You can see a bit of that clash in this video: Mad as a Katter - Bob sees red in Orange pic.twitter.com/9ebKu13Wgf Littleproud has defended Cadell’s conduct, while also attacking Katter’s. Late last month, Katter and fellow independent MP Andrew Wilkie dressed up in pig suits at Parliament House to protest against the supermarkets. Here’s what Littleproud told the ABC: What Ross Cadell showed today was the frustration of many producers, particularly in Orange. Producers that have been done over by Coles and Woolworths. They are wanting a voice. But don’t want stunts. They want adults in the room. Not people dressed up in pig suits trying to bring attention in an undignified way. This is a serious topic. WA rail link remains closed after record rains The only rail line connecting Western Australia to the rest of the country is likely to remain closed for several days as parts of the state experience more than half a year’s worth of rain in 24 hours. The Trans-Australian Railway line, a key freight route running between WA and South Australia through the Nullarbor, has been closed since Sunday with floodwaters inundating parts of the track. The Eyre Highway – the main road connecting WA with SA – was also closed due to flooding, but re-opened on Tuesday morning. National weather update for this week: Temps to drop on the south-east coast from Tuesday but will stay high inland. More rain for interior & southern #WA, Severe Weather Warning in place. Potential tropical #cyclone developing north-west of WA. Latest: https://t.co/jlOoTZL1iF pic.twitter.com/2hoVABMIR8 More than 155mm of rain has fallen on Rawlinna, 900km east of Perth, since 9am on Friday, while the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast 24-hour totals of up to 130mm for parts of the Goldfields, Eucla and south interior districts. Average rainfall in those areas is about 260mm a year. Local share market stabilises The local share market has closed marginally higher, stabilising after Monday’s 1.8% plunge, as traders await another inflation readout from the US that could determine the path of interest rate cuts. AAP reports the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index on Tuesday finished up 8.3 points, or 0.11%, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 9.4 points, or 0.12%. The Australian dollar was buying 66.18 US cents, from 66.15 US cents at Monday’s ASX close. Minister admits people in Gaza ‘clearly need help ‘ Cabinet minister Murray Watt has been asked what would need to happen before the Australian government restores $6m in emergency funding for UNRWA. Australia was among more than a dozen donor countries to suspend funding to the agency in late January, after the Israeli government alleged that 12 UNRWA staff members were involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Here’s what Watt told ABC a few moments ago: I think there is widespread recognition not just within the government, but right around the world, that we do need to see more aid delivered into Gaza at the moment. The conditions that people are living in our horrible and they clearly need help. The issues with UNRWA have been widely ventilated and it is appropriate that an investigation is undertaken. But I know that [foreign minister] Penny Wong is working incredibly hard to have this situation resolved and to explore the best way to get aid in where it is most desperately needed.",2024-03-12T07:30:35Z,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/mar/12/australia-news-live-4bn-closing-the-gap-housing-northern-territory-anthony-albanese-deep-fake-search-engines-aged-care-election-funding,The Guardian
South Korea doctors’ strike: government moves to suspend thousands of medical licences,"South Korea’s government has started taking steps to suspend the medical licences of thousands of striking doctors, as concern grows that the month-long dispute is affecting frontline health care services. The walkout by almost 12,000 doctors from 100 teaching hospitals has led to surgery cancellations, longer waiting times and delays in treatment, including for patients seeking emergency care, according to media reports. The health ministry said it had put in motion procedures that could see 4,900 of the striking doctors lose their licences if they continue to defy orders to return to work. The ministry also said it had sent administrative notifications, following up on warnings that strikers faced a three-month suspension – a punishment that could delay their ability to qualify as specialists for at least a year. The increasingly acrimonious dispute began as a protest against government plans to dramatically raise the number of trainee doctors to address shortages in rural areas and greater demand on services caused by South Korea’s rapidly ageing population. But the 11,994 striking doctors, who make up 93% of the trainee workforce, claim the recruitment of 2,000 additional students a year from 2025 will compromise the quality of services. Instead, they have called for improvements to pay and conditions. This week the health ministry said it would assign 20 military surgeons and 138 public health doctors to boost staff numbers at selected hospitals, but denied that the country’s health services had descended into chaos. Chun Byung-wang, director of the ministry’s health and medical policy division, suggested that doctors who return will avoid punishment. “The government will take into account the circumstance and protect trainee doctors if they return to work before the administrative measure is complete,” Chun said. He added: “The government will not give up on dialogue. The door is always open. The government will respect and listen to opinions of the medical community as a companion for the medical reforms.” In an attempt to resolve the dispute, the government last week announced measures to improve pay and conditions for trainee medics, as well as a review of continuous 36-hour shifts – a key grievance among junior medics. But the concessions have failed to placate doctors. Demands are growing for the two sides to negotiate. “Doctors and the government are not in a boxing ring,” the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial. “People’s patience is wearing thin … the exit from this quagmire must be found through dialogue between the two sides.” Critics of the recruitment plan have accused the country’s conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, of using the medical reforms to boost his People Power party’s prospects at next month’s national assembly elections. A poll published last week by the Yonhap news agency found 84% of respondents supported hiring more doctors, and 43% said striking physicians should receive severe punishments.",2024-03-12T05:06:24Z,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/12/south-korea-doctor-strike-government-suspends-medical-licenses,The Guardian
