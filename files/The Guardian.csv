"China will use AI to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India, Microsoft warns","China will attempt to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India this year with artificial intelligence-generated content after making a dry run with the presidential poll in Taiwan, Microsoft has warned. The US tech firm said it expected Chinese state-backed cyber groups to target high-profile elections in 2024, with North Korea also involved, according to a report by the company’s threat intelligence team published on Friday. “As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections,” the report reads. Microsoft said that “at a minimum” China will create and distribute through social media AI-generated content that “benefits their positions in these high-profile elections”. The company added that the impact of AI-made content was minor but warned that could change. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft. Microsoft said in the report that China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January. The company said this was the first time it had seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election. A Beijing-backed group called Storm 1376, also known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, was highly active during the Taiwanese election. Its attempts to influence the election included posting fake audio on YouTube of the election candidate Terry Gou – who had bowed out in November – endorsing another candidate. Microsoft said the clip was “likely AI generated”. YouTube removed the content before it reached many users. The Beijing-backed group pushed a series of AI-generated memes about the ultimately successful candidate, William Lai – a pro-sovereignty candidate opposed by Beijing – that levelled baseless claims against Lai accusing him of embezzling state funds. There was also an increased use of AI-generated TV news anchors, a tactic that has also been used by Iran, with the “anchor” making unsubstantiated claims about Lai’s private life including fathering illegitimate children. Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut tool, which is developed by Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Microsoft added that Chinese groups continue to mount influence campaigns in the US. It said Beijing-backed actors are using social media accounts to pose “divisive questions” and attempt to understand issues dividing US voters. “This could be to gather intelligence and precision on key voting demographics ahead of the US Presidential election,” said Microsoft in a blog post accompanying the report. One post on X, formerly Twitter, referred to a $118bn bipartisan bill in the US that combined a $20bn of investment in the US-Mexico border with a $75bn package for Ukraine and Israel. It asked: “What’s your reaction?” Another flagged the loss of an F-35 fighter in South Carolina last year, saying “only under the Biden administration” could a valuable piece of military hardware be lost – although debris was found soon after – and asked “what do you think about this?” The report was published in the same week that a White House-appointed official review board said “a cascade of errors” by Microsoft let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior US officials. Last month, the US and UK governments accused China-backed hackers of waging a years-long cyber campaign targeting politicians, journalists and businesses, as well as the UK’s election watchdog.",2024-04-05T04:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/05/china-using-ai-disrupt-elections

Nothing beats a good chat – so long as you can walk away when things get awkward | Nell Frizzell,"While on my way to look at an iguanodon skeleton the other day, at the Museum of Natural History in Oxford, I bumped into three people I knew. Each time, I spent about two minutes in the street with them, bathed in watery spring sunshine, having the lightest sort of conversation possible. You know the sort of thing: “How was your Easter? Did you go to that ceilidh on Monday? Aren’t these sunny evenings nice? Did you know you can eat magnolia flowers?” It was perfect. Larry David may hate the stop-and-chat, but I adore it. As someone who is as easy with small talk as I am qualified to perform dentistry in North Korea, I am grateful for the fact that I can just walk away when things, inevitably, get awkward. It’s not a party, I’m not at work; I’m unlikely to get caught with this person for any longer than about five minutes. Moreover, there are buildings, trees and people around to comment on if I forget the person’s name or ask after their boyfriend, who turns out to be their ex-boyfriend, or spit in the air while trying to say the word “sophisticated”. I first bonded with my friend Zuhura over our love of the stop-and-chat. At the time, she was living on a boat; the entire Thames footpath was essentially her doorstep so she spent her life having golden nuggets of social interaction with people who were in transit. It could be political, flirtatious, heartfelt or polite, but it was always on the hoof. To have a preplanned, static conversation can sometimes be a little too intense, a bit staged. You think too much about what you are wearing, what time you will be able to eat, if you have something caught in your nostril and whether you should have sat outside. With the stop-and-chat, you each get the other as they are. It is what embeds you in a community, a landscape and a language. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get going.

"Ex-defence ministers ‘wrong’ to say UK unprepared for war, deputy PM says","Former defence ministers are wrong to issue a stark warning that the UK is unprepared for war as a “whole-nation endeavour”, the deputy prime minister has said. The outgoing defence minister, James Heappey, called on ministers to do more to prepare for conflict just weeks after resigning from his Ministry of Defence (MoD) post, saying the UK has failed to prepare for war. His former boss Ben Wallace echoed his sentiments, suggesting some in government are just hoping threats to the UK “will go away”. Labour has described it as “an alarming admission”, adding: “The cost of Tory chaos is a government that doesn’t take the UK’s defence seriously.” Oliver Dowden hit back, saying “they are wrong”. He told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show: “We are taking action across the board. We have set up a national cybersecurity centre in respect of cyber. I now take dozens of decisions daily about investment to protect our economic security. “This world is going to get more dangerous as time goes on. We see a combination of hostile states, not least Russia, Iran, North Korea and China. “We need to be taking action across those areas. Of course there is always more to do, but I believe we are making good progress against rising threat.” Heappeywrote in the Sunday Telegraph that the UK was behind its allies who have taken steps to reinforce citizens’ preparedness for war. He wrote that he had urged ministers to prepare for conflict and take part in a “whole of government” exercise, first championed by Wallace, to practice evacuating to a bunker because of the “growing instability and insecurity directed at Britain”. But only MoD officials took part, despite certain cabinet ministers having access to reserved beds and desks in the UK’s wartime bunker. “It’s a stark reminder that war is a whole-nation endeavour and, to be frank, in the UK we’re a very long way behind,” he wrote. Wallace echoed his criticisms in the newspaper, saying there were too many people in the government relying on hoping the current instability would go away. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He said: “The growing instability and insecurity directed at Britain and her allies means that the whole of society needs to make a step change towards recognising that our core duty is to think about our defence and our resilience. “It’s how we used to think during the cold war, and everyone from local government to the MoD played their part.” A Labour spokesperson said: “Since 2010, the Conservatives hollowed out our armed forces, cut the army to its smallest size since Napoleon, wasted billions of pounds in defence procurement, and overseen service morale fall to record lows.“Labour knows the first duty of any government is to keep the nation safe and protect our citizens. We will always do what’s required to defend this country.” The government has belatedly started reviewing its national plan for the defence of the UK in the event of a war, after mounting threats of conflict. Heappey has called for a focus on strategic resilience including securing food and energy supples, more money for defence, and repurposing industry to build weapons. Rishi Sunak is under pressure to increase defence spending. Last month, Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Home Office minister Tom Tugendhat publicly called for defence spending to reach at least 2.5% of GDP.",2024-04-07T15:25:26Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/07/ex-defence-ministers-uk-unprepared-for-war-oliver-dowden
"A show to relish: Tomato, the dance spectacular about lust that’s a bit like a food fight","‘How to choose tomatoes?” asks the voiceover, as three bodies writhe around the stage. “How to find the fake, acquired and invented tomato? First, the leaves. Second, the shape. Third, feel with your hand. Fourth, check the bottom. Good luck and enjoy your tomato.” The dancers twist and turn, squeezing and sucking tomatoes, throwing them or pouring a bucket of them over themselves. A live camera brings the audience into the show as the performers dance together in movements that are abstract, absurd, lustful, funny and confronting. “Every time we’re on stage,” says Chou Kuan-Jou, the Taiwanese dancer-choreographer who created the show, “we can really feel the energy from the audience because we have a lot of eye contact with them.” The show, named Tomato, is an experimental dance piece exploring sexuality, gender and desire, all influenced by how sexism, shyness and feminism affect her home country. Tomato drew rave reviews at its 2022 Edinburgh fringe festival debut, and is now returning to the UK for two shows at the Taiwan festival in London. Its creator is a young Taiwan-born artist who teaches schoolchildren and elderly women dance, as well as working with disability advocacy groups. Speaking from Taipei, Chou says Tomato was first inspired by discussions about menstruation, pregnancy, sexuality and social expectations. But as she began exploring her own sexuality, the show has morphed and the lineup has changed. Reviewers have noted the “sudden shifts” in the mood of the show, which seem to have left audiences delightfully shocked, but also a little confused by the multiple themes and the chaotically abstract performance. Chou suggests that this is a fair reflection of her own changing experience in terms of the subject matter. “Tomato is about exploring lust with a sexualising body and experimenting with the fluidity of it. In these three years, the show has been changing with my life, my personal body experience.” Tomato has also taken on darker themes, as Chou learned of disturbing online trends in Taiwan and Korea, from the sharing of videos showing violence against women to Taiwan’s belated #MeToo movement. The latter has drawn in dozens of high-profile figures, sparked a nationwide conversation and prompted changes in the law. The conversation was good and necessary, Chou says, but she would have liked to see it go further, pushing against social conservatism to more freely discuss sex and desire, particularly for women, groups such as the LGBTQ+ community and people with disabilities. Instead, it was framed around victims and perpetrators. “What about the complexity of sexuality?” she says. “That’s my goal right now, to open the discussion.” Chou says the show received a very different reception in Edinburgh, where it was met with laughter. “Sometimes I feel it’s too much,” she says. As for her more conservative home country, she says: “In Taiwan, I can feel the insecurity and intense atmosphere in the audience. They are like a big wall I have to punch through. A lot of people stay for the Q&A section, but I sense they don’t know how to transform their feelings and thoughts into words because the discussion of desire or sexuality is not really familiar in Taiwan.” Chou says her school pupils sometimes come to her for advice, or let her know they’ve seen her work online. Members of her Chinese cultural dance class have come to her shows, but they are often too shy to talk about what they saw. Another work, Free Touch, invites members of the public to sit with her and be open to making and receiving physical contact. She recently took it to Perth, Australia, setting up in a corner of Hyde Park, where some extraordinary moments of interaction occurred. “It’s a play on boundaries and trust, of intimacy in the public space. It also reminds me of a Tinder date, because sometimes you can really feel the connection.” Chou acknowledges that there is an element of risk involved. “Yeah, it’s dangerous,” she says. “But I want to see the dangers and understand them.” She pauses then adds: “I’ve also signed up for martial arts.”  The Taiwan festival runs for 15 days from 12 April at London’s Coronet theatre.

David Cameron to set out UK basis for continuing arms sales to Israel,"David Cameron will set out the UK’s reasoning for continuing to export arms to Israel on Tuesday as ministers face ongoing pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. The foreign secretary will discuss the Middle East crisis with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken, on a visit to Washington where he is also expected to give an update on the UK’s arms export regime. Downing Street said it had no plans to publish the legal advice but that it wanted to be transparent about its decision to continue exporting arms during the Gaza conflict. “We are obviously aware of the interest in this issue and we will always look to be transparent about our decisions on these matters whilst respecting the longstanding convention that we don’t publish legal advice on these issues,” the prime minister’s official spokesperson said. Rishi Sunak has come under mounting pressure from senior Conservatives – including the veteran peer Nicholas Soames and the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns – to suspend weapons exports in light of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The calls follow an attack that killed seven aid workers, including three Britons, who worked for the food charity World Central Kitchen. Keir Starmer also faces pressure to back an end to arms sales after calls for the government to consider immediate action made by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan; the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar; and the Labour MP Margaret Beckett, who was foreign secretary under Tony Blair. The UK’s arms exports regime would prevent the supply of weapons to Israel if there was a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. UK companies provide about 0.02% of Israel’s overall arms imports. The No 10 spokesperson insisted the government was “completely united” over the conflict despite claims of a cabinet split, with Lord Cameron taking a more strident approach to criticism of Israel than some of his colleagues. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, had suggested there was a “bit of relish from some people” about the opportunity to criticise Israel, although No 10 rejected the notion he was referring to Cameron. Mel Stride, a close ally of Sunak, said on Monday that Israel “abides by the rule of law” but – echoing the foreign secretary’s remarks – stressed that UK support for the country was not unconditional. The work and pensions secretary said: “We expect Israel not to do the kinds of things that happened with the aid workers, and we have made it very clear that we are appalled by what happened there.” The Israeli military has withdrawn its forces from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis but could still mount an offensive against Hamas’s last stronghold in Rafah despite the UK and US leading international pleas for restraint. After six months of conflict triggered by the 7 October massacre by Hamas in southern Israel, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Rafah. Any large-scale assault would be likely to lead to a high death toll.

He will hold talks with the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and is hoping to meet the House speaker, Mike Johnson, whose colleagues are preventing the vote on Ukraine aid. “Success for Ukraine and failure for [Vladimir] Putin are vital for American and European security,” Cameron said before his trip. “This will show that borders matter, that aggression doesn’t pay and that countries like Ukraine are free to choose their own future. “The alternative would only encourage Putin in further attempts to re-draw European borders by force, and would be heard clearly in Beijing, Tehran and North Korea.” The UK announced another £2.5bn in aid earlier this year to help Ukraine fight the Russian invasion and the EU has pledged another £43bn. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said his country would lose the war unless Congress passes the military assistance package. “If Ukraine loses the war, other states will be attacked,” he said.",2024-04-08T23:01:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/09/david-cameron-to-set-out-uk-basis-for-continuing-arms-sales-to-israel
"Australia faces postwar-style reconstruction to reach net zero target, Greg Combet says","Australia faces a postwar-scale reconstruction costing hundreds of billions of dollars in private and public investment to reach net zero emissions by mid-century, according to the former Labor climate minister and incoming Future Fund chair, Greg Combet. Speaking at the National Press Club, Combet said the Net Zero Economy Authority – a new government agency proposed to help manage the country’s transformation from a dirty to a clean economy – was putting together a “pipeline” of clean industrial projects and would be “figuring out how to help bring them to concrete investment decisions”. Combet was speaking as the chair of the Net Zero Economy Agency, which was set up to design the authority and begin its work. Legislation to create the authority was tabled in parliament last week. A former union boss and cabinet minister in the Gillard government, Combet will leave the agency next month to succeed Peter Costello as the chair of the Future Fund, the country’s $212bn sovereign wealth fund. He said the authority had been designed to play a coordinating role in helping Australia become a renewable energy “superpower”, initially focusing on emissions-intensive parts of the country that were home to ageing coal-fired power plants that were near the end of their life. A key part of its job would be ensuring workers and communities were supported through the change and shared in the benefits, he said. “If we do this well, Australia has the opportunity to develop numerous new clean industrial projects, involving billions of investment dollars and providing thousands of jobs,” he said. “Neither government funding nor private capital alone can meet this challenge.” Combet said the agency had been involved “in the policy discussion” in the lead-up to next month’s budget, and the government had indicated it would “look to capitalise on Australia’s comparative advantage in minerals and renewable energy, aiming to encourage large-scale investment in green industrial production”. He suggested that the government and its funding bodies would need to look beyond grants and concessional loans, and should consider direct investments in “particularly large transformative projects” when necessary. “Governments may need to consider being significant equity players, helping to de-risk projects and adopting a long-term view before recovering capital,” he said. Anthony Albanese has indicated the government plans to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act, which includes A$570bn in clean incentives, but acknowledges it cannot compete with it on dollar terms. The government promised $2bn for green hydrogen production in last year’s budget and last week announced $1bn for solar manufacturing. Some economists have questioned whether these investments were well targeted given the scale of investment under way elsewhere, particularly in China and the US, and suggested Australia should focus on industries in which it could have a natural advantage, such as green iron. Combet said the US legislation had “changed the game”, and the European Union, Japan and Korea had followed with “unprecedented investments in their industrial base”. “The race is on to secure the industries of the future,” he said. “Australia needs to respond, and we are.” Sign up to Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He said the agency had begun work in Gladstone and the central Queensland region, which produces more than 40% of the state’s energy and is home to nearly half of the country’s coalmines. He said it was an example of a place that would feel the impact of what was coming but where there could be new opportunities. “It’s a major producer of key industrial products like cement, alumina, aluminium and ammonia, and it’s a major trade hub, with the Port of Gladstone facilitating tens of billions of dollars of trade every year in exports of coal, gas and aluminium to our trading partners,” he said. “In my view, successfully transforming the region around Gladstone, and similar regions around the country, must be a key national endeavour.” He said the authority legislation included a funded redeployment scheme. The body would support workers “to acquire skills, to access new employment if needed, to help create jobs in new businesses and industries”, he said. “The touchstone will be how well we handle the closure of coal-fired power stations,” he said.

Israel to reopen Erez crossing into Gaza | First Thing,"Good morning. The office of the Israeli prime minister has said that the Erez crossing, which lies in northern Gaza and for years served as the only passenger terminal for people to move in and out of the territory, will be temporarily reopened in an effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid. More aid will also be allowed through the port of Ashdod, which lies about 25 miles north of Gaza, and authorities will further allow “increased Jordanian aid through Kerem Shalom”, a border crossing in southern Israel. Today’s announcement came just hours after Joe Biden called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza, telling Benjamin Netanyahu in a testy meeting that future US support for Israel would depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and aid workers. How did the US react to today’s announcement? Antony Blinken welcomed the steps, but remained cautious. The US secretary of state said: “These are positive developments but the real test is results.” What’s going on at the UN regarding this conflict? The UN Human Rights Council was today debating whether to demand a halt in arms sales to Israel “to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights”. A report by Microsoft’s threat intelligence team said Chinese state-backed cyber groups would probably target high-profile elections in 2024 with artificial intelligence-generated content. China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January – the first time Microsoft has seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft. Voting rights groups have filed a federal lawsuit against Alabama to block enforcement of a new law that criminalizes some kinds of voter assistance with absentee ballots.

Prostate cancer cases worldwide are projected to double to 2.9m a year by 2040, with annual deaths predicted to rise by 85%, a study has found. A federal judge has denied Donald Trump’s attempts to have his classified records case dismissed on the contention that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to transform them as personal property and possess them at his Mar-a-Lago club. Despite efforts to improve air quality before the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, air pollution is still far worse in China than in many developed countries. About half of China’s cities failed to meet their own national standards in 2019 – let alone those from the World Health Organization. Despite the country’s comprehensive action plans, researchers have said air pollution deaths in China will begin to rise soon without accelerated action. “For China to even just tread water, it needs to reduce air pollution even more aggressively,” said Prof Michael Brauer from the University of British Columbia. In Tennessee, Republicans have accelerated their attacks on democratic norms, most recently expelling two Black Democratic lawmakers calling for gun reform from the state House of Representatives. They’ve maintained conservative domination in the state with gerrymandered districts, disenfranchised voters and an increasing sense of political despair – in many cases, insulating themselves from political consequences. “The leadership in the state is not the old guard,” said Dr Sekou Franklin, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University. “They’re an extreme version of conservatives who believe that they have broad sovereignty to govern, in many respects irrespective of what goes on in the national government.” In many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, hyenas are feared and denigrated. In the folklore of the Ethiopian highlands, people with the “evil eye” turn into hyenas at night and attack their neighbors. But in Harar, a walled city in eastern Ethiopia, hyenas are welcomed, acting as the city’s garbage-disposal system, entering at night through a series of “hyena doors” built into the walls and eating entrails dumped in the streets. US banks are sabotaging their climate commitments to cut back on emissions by continuing to finance meat, dairy and feed corporations, a report has found. The report has linked more than 24m metric tonnes of CO2 – about equal to the annual emissions from 5m cars – to animal protein and feed company financing by what it calls the “big three” livestock lenders: Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. “Banks have committed to pathways to net zero, but they are ignoring a huge cow-shaped hole in their plans,” said Monique Mikhail at Friends of the Earth. Adrienne Matei took on the 30-plants-a-week challenge, inspired by a 2018 study that found that those who eat a wide variety of plant foods have better gut health and that instead of the classic “five a day” goal people should strive to eat 30 plants a week. But could the challenge be easier for Adrienne than it seems, given that even a small quantity of the plant counts – and substances like coffee and tea technically go toward the tally?

"Russia-Ukraine war live: 20 members of Russian airfield personnel killed or injured in drone attack, Kyiv says – as it happened","Ukrainian officials claimed on Friday that the drone strike targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia had killed or injured 20 members of personnel. The officials, speaking on anonymity to the AP because they were not authorised to publicly discuss the operation, had also said the attack destroyed at least six military aircrafts and badly damaged eight others. However, Russian defence officials claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. It has just turned 6pm in Ukraine and Russia. Here are the key events you might have missed from the day: A Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia has killed or injured 20 members of airfield personnel and destroyed six Russian warplanes, as well as badly damaging eight others, according to officials in Kyiv. Russian defence officials, however, have claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged in the barrage. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. A Russian airstrike on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia has killed two people and injured six others, according to local governor. A series of blasts had been reported in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday. Reuters reported earlier in the day that Ukraine’s air force shot down all 13 drones used in Russia’s overnight attack on the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk, though nothing had been said about the missiles. Russian investigators claimed to have found pro-Ukraine data on the phone of one of the Moscow terror attack suspects, despite evidence that an offshoot of the Islamic State (IS) was responsible. Russia’s investigative committee said that data from one of the suspects’ phones showed that on the morning of 24 February this year – the second anniversary of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine – he had trawled for photographs of the Crocus City Hall and sent it to others. It said the suspect “had confirmed all this in his statements” and also said they had found photos showing men in camouflage holding the Ukrainian flag in front of destroyed buildings. Human rights experts however have warned that any statements or confessions from the suspects should be met with scepticism given that the men appeared to have been repeatedly tortured, according to gruesome videos and photographs circulating of their interrogations. A Russian governor was hospitalised after being stabbed, a spokesperson has said. Andrey Chibis, governor of far northern Murmansk was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in the town of Apatity, where he had been holding a meeting. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had “come around” after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. Chibis is a member of the United Russia ruling party and has governed Murmansk region since 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin’s Ukraine offensive. Russian forces have taken control of a settlement named Vodyane in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, according to a Russia’s defence ministry statement. The ministry provided no further ddetails of the settlement. Authorities in Russia’s eastern city of Khabarovsk declared a state of emergency in an area where a “radiation source” was found, according to Russian news agency TASS reports. It said elevated radiation levels were detected near a power pylon, approximately 2.5km (1.5 miles) from residential buildings. It also said radiation levels would be monitored for the next two days and the source of the radiation would be investigated, but nobody has been injured or exposed to radiation so far. The Kremlin called French President Emmanuel Macron’s assertions that Russia plans to disrupt the Olympics “absolutely unfounded.” Macron said on Thursday that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. When asked about Russia’s threat to the games by a reporter, Macron said, “I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information.” The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organisation said that a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian-held town of Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. In a post on X, MSF said it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”. Ukrainian military drones attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, but no serious damage was detected, Russian state media has reported, citing the plant’s press service. The Guardian could not independently verify the alleged incident. In the past, both sides have accused one other of shelling the plant, none of whose six reactors are operating. Japan announced new sanctions against Russia. Japan’s trade ministry announced the decision to ban exports of 164 goods to Russia, including automobile engine oil and optical equipment. They are also expected to ban imports of Russian nonindustrial diamonds. The Ukrainian military denied that Russian forces had entered the suburbs of Chasiv Yar, a town in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, but said there was fighting ongoing in the area. “The situation there is very difficult, the fighting continues, but they are not there,” Andriy Zadubinnyi, spokesman for Ukraine’s eastern command told Reuters. Russia’s RIA news agency cited an adviser to the Russian-appointed regional head earlier as saying that Russian forces were in the suburb of Chasiv Yar. A Russian air attack on Ukraine’s southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed two people and injured six more, the regional governor said on Friday afternoon. A nine-year-old boy and his mother were among the injured, Ivan Fedorov added on Telegram. An image posted by the governor showed a cafe with shattered windows. A series of blasts was reported in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday. The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organisation said on Friday that a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian-held town of Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. In a post on X, MSF said it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”. “This attack on our office is far from being an isolated incident. The destruction of civilian infrastructure has been a hallmark of this war for a long time,” says Vincenzo Porpiglia, emergency coordinator for MSF in Ukraine.” Ukrainian police said five civilians were wounded in the strike. 🔴 BREAKING: Today, on 5 April at around 3 am, our office in Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, was bombed and completely destroyed. All our staff are safe. Five civilians who were close to the office were injured... 🧵#WarInUkraine pic.twitter.com/hkFlP4ekWB Arsenal defender Oleksandr Zichenko says he would leave the Premier League to fight in Ukraine if he were called up by his country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week signed into law a measure lowering the country’s army mobilisation age from 27 to 25, the country’s parliament said on its website. Professional footballer Zinchenko, who has won 60 caps for Ukraine, told BBC’s Newsnight programme he would answer a call-up. “I think it’s a clear answer. I would go (to fight)“, he said. He added that former school friends were involved in the conflict. “It’s tough to understand that just recently we’ve been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,” he said. The 27-year-old former Manchester City player told the BBC he had donated about £1m ($1.25m) to help people in his country since Russia’s invasion in 2022. “I know maybe some people might think that it’s much easier … for me being here (in London) rather than being there (in Ukraine),” he said. “I really hope that this war will end soon.” Ukrainian military drones have attacked Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, but no serious damage has been detected, Russian state media reports, citing plant’s press service. The Guardian could not independently verify the alleged incident. In the past, both sides have accused one other of shelling the plant, none of whose six reactors are operating. Russian forces have taken control of a settlement named Vodyane in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement on Friday. The ministry provided no further details. More updates to come … Russia has summoned the South Korean ambassador to protest over sanctions by Seoul against Russian individuals and legal entities, the Russian foreign ministry said on Friday. South Korea has imposed sanctions against two Russian vessels which it says were carrying military cargo to North Korea. Seoul said on Tuesday that it had also sanctioned two Russian organisations and two Russian citizens linked to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Russia considers South Korea’s decision as an unfriendly move and will respond in due course. Russia is very likely to have been behind disturbances affecting GPS navigation in the Baltic region, Germany’s defence ministry said today. “The persistent disruptions to the global navigation satellite system are very likely of Russian origin and are based on disruptions in the electromagnetic spectrum, including those originating in the Kaliningrad Oblast,” a spokesperson for the ministry told Reuters. Three civilians have been injured in Kherson, Ukrinform reported. “The Russian troops attacked Beryslav again using a drone. Three people sustained injuries from the explosives that were dropped,” Kherson’s regional military administration said. A former city councillor and member of the Massachusetts national guard who is wanted in the US on child sexual abuse image charges has fled the country and joined the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Wilmer Puello-Mota, 28, former city councillor of Holyoke, Massachusetts, went missing on 7 January, two days before he was scheduled to appear in court in Rhode Island in possession of child sexual abuse images and obstruction of justice charges. This week, Puello-Mota resurfaced at an enlistment centre in the Russian region of Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, where he was captured on film signing a military contract. Read the rest of the story here: The governor of Russia’s far northern Murmansk region was in hospital on Friday after being stabbed by a man, his spokesperson said. Andrey Chibis, 45, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in the town of Apatity, where he had been holding a meeting. “Now he is in post-operative condition. It is too early to make predictions on his recovery and how long it will take,” Liliya Sechkina told Russian state TV. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had “come around” after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. The attacker was detained and is expected to undergo “psychiatric examinations”, investigators said. They added, “During interrogation, the man explained that he had committed the attack because he felt dislike for the governor, although he did not know him personally,.” Chibis is a member of the United Russia ruling party and has governed Murmansk region since 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin’s Ukraine offensive. Ukrainian officials claimed on Friday that the drone strike targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia had killed or injured 20 members of personnel. The officials, speaking on anonymity to the AP because they were not authorised to publicly discuss the operation, had also said the attack destroyed at least six military aircrafts and badly damaged eight others. However, Russian defence officials claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged.

"Russia-Ukraine war: We need to do more to help Ukraine, Nato chief says – as it happened","Wrapping up a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that the situation in the battlefield in Ukraine remains serious and that Ukraine needs more air defences and assistance. We need to do even more, he said, adding that support needs to be put on a more enduring basis. Nato foreign ministers met for a second day in Brussels, marking the 75th anniversary of the alliance’s founding. The ministers held talks with Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister. Kuleba stressed Ukraine’s call for more air defences. “Saving Ukrainian lives, saving Ukrainian economy, saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of Patriots and other air defence systems in Ukraine. He also emphasised that “providing Patriots depends on allies, they have plenty of them.” The Ukrainian minister also said he spoke with the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and “urged our American partners to find ways to provide additional ‘Patriot’ air defence systems as soon as possible.” The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that “we heard loud and clear what the foreign minister said” and that Berlin will ask allies to check if they can provide more air defences. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, has said that “without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also reiterated the need for air defences. “Strengthening Ukraine’s air defence capabilities directly translates into saving lives,” he said on social media. After the ministers’ meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, emphasised that more needs to be done to help Ukraine. Allies will now go back and look into their inventories to see if there’s any way to provide more air defence systems, Stoltenberg. The Nato chief also said allies should be able to establish a stronger, more robust framework for long-term support for Ukraine, so aid can continue on a more predictable basis. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said that four people were killed and 12 were wounded in Russian drone attacks. Around 350,000 residents were without power in the Kharkiv region following the overnight drone attack, the Ukrainian energy ministry said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. Stoltenberg also said he opposes any attempt by Georgia’s government to introduce a law on foreign agents. The situation on the battlefield is difficult, Jens Stoltenberg said, stressing that there is an urgency when it comes to mobilising ore support for Ukraine. If more support is not mobilised, there is a risk that Russia captures more territory, he warned. The Ukrainians have demonstrated they are extremely capable of using the equipment provided by Nato allies, he said. The Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies need to do two things: mobilise more support for Kyiv in the coming days and weeks, and but then also ensure that we’re able to establish a stronger, more robust framework for long-term support, so aid can continue on a more predictable basis. The Nato chief reiterated that the alliance’s military leadership has been tasked with coming up with a structure, which would have to be underpinned by a financial commitment. He declined to go into more detail about plans. Asked about Ukraine’s ask for more air defences, Jens Stoltenberg said allies understand the urgency. Allies will now go back and look into their inventories to see if there’s any way to provide more systems, including Patriots, he said. It’s partly a question of systems, and partly a question of delivering interceptors, the Nato chief said, stressing recent announcements of extra support. Wrapping up a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that the situation in the battlefield in Ukraine remains serious and that Ukraine needs more air defences and assistance. We need to do even more, he said, adding that support needs to be put on a more enduring basis. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, has said that “without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism.” In a sharply-worded thread on social media, the outspoken minister said that “comforting stories can help win elections. But if they are false they immobilise us, prevent us from taking real action, while Ukrainians continue to die for us.” He added: “There is little mystery about what can happen if we keep waiting for a miracle. Territories can be lost, countries can be occupied. There is no positive spin to this story, no happy ending, unless we choose to rewrite this scrip.” Nice stories don’t win wars. Without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism. 🧵👇 Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, will soon address reporters. Stay tuned. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke with the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and “urged our American partners to find ways to provide additional ‘Patriot’ air defense systems as soon as possible.” Kuleba also noted that they “discussed next steps in the coming days and weeks to unlock supplemental US aid for Ukraine.” I was pleased to meet with @SecBlinken in Brussels to express my gratitude to the United States for all of its assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale aggression.I briefed Secretary Blinken on Russia's increased air terror against Ukrainian cities and… pic.twitter.com/8WcdgBwF1D Speaking alongside her Ukrainian counterpart, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said at Nato headquarters that “we heard loud and clear what the foreign minister said and I also would like to underline, we see what’s happening in Ukraine, realising that you need this air defence now.” She added: “We will call in Europe again that everybody has to check where their air defence is, what they can provide for Ukraine.” Together with @ABaerbock we have just attended the NATO-Ukraine council meeting in Brussels. Ukraine’s greatest need right now is to urgently strengthen air defense. I thank Germany and other allies for answering the call and taking action right away. pic.twitter.com/wgfs96Mv9k Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said China has proposed the most reasonable peace plan so far for resolving the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reported. “The most important thing for us is that the Chinese document is based on an analysis of the reasons for what is happening and the need to eliminate these root causes. It is structured in logic from the general to the specific,” state news agency RIA quoted Lavrov saying. “This plan was criticized for being vague... But this is a reasonable plan that the great Chinese civilization proposed for discussion,” he said. The EU has fired a warning shot at the Georgian government after it announced it was resurrecting a bill on “foreign agents” that it abandoned last year after critics compared it to current Russian laws silencing criticism in the media. In a statement the EU’s external service reminded Georgia that “ensuring media freedom” was one of the “crucial” conditions of the EU membership process. “The European Union recalls the public pledge of the Georgian government and the ruling party from last year to “unconditionally withdraw” such legislation. The EU regrets that it is once again being considered despite strong public and international reactions in March 2023,” it said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that critics of the draft law “need to more actively explain the absurdity of considering this a Russian project”. Peskov added that Russia wants “stability and predictability” in Georgia, and defended the proposed law, saying: “No state wants interference from other countries in domestic politics; this is normal practice.” Romania’s foreign minister, Luminița Odobescu, has called for “ambitious actions” to support Ukraine.

We remain firmly committed to providing support for #UA as long as needed. pic.twitter.com/zZ3NokLRuP US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said that Ukraine will eventually become a Nato member, adding that support for the country was “rock solid” among member states. “Ukraine will become a member of Nato. Our purpose at the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership,” Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian troops launched a wave of Shahed drones against Ukraine’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, overnight. Four people were killed and 12 were wounded, the regional governor has said. Watch the latest footage from the attack: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. When asked about Russia’s threat to the Olympics by a reporter, Macron said, “I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information.” His comment, delivered at an event in Paris for the inauguration of the new Olympics aquatic centre, is the most explicit acknowledgement to date of foreign threats to the security of the games. Macron has recently adopted a tougher stance on the war, vowing that Moscow must be defeated, although he has made clear that France has no intention of instigating hostilities against Russia. Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said France will propose EU-wide level sanctions on those behind spreading “disinformation”. The Finnish government will extend the closure of border crossings with Russia until further notice, the government said today, Reuters reported. “We are working with our partners to strengthen the protection of our cities and villages and to protect our citizens,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said this morning. “Strengthening Ukraine’s air defense capabilities directly translates into saving lives,” he stressed.
