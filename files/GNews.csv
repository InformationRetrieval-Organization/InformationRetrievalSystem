From the frying pan to the fire: green onions ignite voter anger in South Korea’s elections,"Yoon Suk Yeol is hardly the first elected politician to appear out of touch with ordinary voters during a cost-of-living crisis. But as South Korea prepares for key national assembly elections on Wednesday, its conservative president has been tripped up by a humble vegetable.
In recent weeks, green onions have gone from a simple staple of Korean cooking to a powerful symbol of voter anger over rising prices in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.
Its ascent from the kitchen into politics came during Yoon’s recent visit to a supermarket in Seoul that was intended to portray him as someone who understands the financial pressures faced by ordinary families.
Yoon said he had been to many markets and described as “reasonable” the store’s 875 won (51p) price tag for a bundle of green onions.

Observers were quick to point out, however, that the items had been only temporarily discounted thanks to government subsidies, while the supermarket had made a further price cut. The actual retail price is three to four times higher, hovering at 3,000-4,000 won in recent weeks.
Yoon’s People Power party is hoping to take control of the 300-seat assembly from a liberal majority led by the opposition Democratic party but the trip to the shops has added to criticism that Yoon appears aloof.
It has fuelled a surge in support for smaller parties that could upset the balance of power and render Yoon a lame-duck leader just two years into his presidency. His party has already been grappling with low approval ratings before the vote, which is being seen as a midterm referendum on Yoon’s administration.
Dining out on onion memes
It is not just the price of green onions that has seen significant rises. The price of agricultural products in March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The price of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.

Nevertheless, opposition candidates have used green onions as props during campaign speeches to draw attention to Yoon’s hapless attempt to court the average man and woman on the Seoul omnibus.
Social media was awash with onion memes, with some users posting photographs of green onions outside polling stations after the National Election Commission banned green onions from the locations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”.
“While people’s expression of political views should be respected to the maximum level, using a certain item as a means of expression other than for their original purpose has great potential to affect the election,” the commission said.
Hyun Jung, 36, said she hadn’t initially thought about the green onion issue, “but after I heard about the ban, I bought a green onion hairband and I’m determined to wear it on election day”.
If Yoon’s party fails to win more seats and take control of the assembly, Yoon risks seeing out the remaining three years of his term struggling to pass his policy agenda.
“If the People Power party is still a minority party after the general election … cooperation with the National Assembly will be very difficult,” Kang Joo-hyun, a professor of political science and international relations at Sookmyung Women’s University, told Agence France-Presse. “The president will become a lame duck quickly and … the power of state affairs will be greatly reduced.”
In a Gallup survey on 31 March, the opposition Democratic party, led by Lee Jae-myung, was polling slightly ahead of Yoon’s party – 37% to 35%.
The opposition parties are framing the votes as “judgment day”, suggesting that it is not just about choosing political candidates but also an opportunity for the public to send a strong message to the government over its handling of the economy.
Yoon, whose scandal-hit wife has been conspicuously absent from the campaign, is battling low approval ratings. His popularity did, though, gain momentum after he announced an increase in medical school trainees. The move was criticised by thousands of trainee doctors who have been on strike since February but voters who are worried about the country’s ability to care for its fast-ageing population have supported the move.
A four-week-old potential kingmaker
Disaffection with the political establishment has given smaller parties a rare opportunity to gain ground, including the Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk.
On the eve of the election Cho, whose party is competing only for the 46 seats contested through proportional representation, was polling neck-and-neck with the ruling party, despite being launched only four weeks ago, and is forecast to win between 10 and 15 seats.

Securing about 15 seats would enable Cho’s party to potentially form a coalition that could prevent the People Power party from regaining control of the assembly.
“If the opposition parties gain a significant number of seats … Yoon regime’s system will be shaken, and cracks will appear,” said Cho.
“The People Power party will be divided. The president will become a lame duck, and then a dead duck,” said Cho, who was forced to abandon his presidential ambitions by the 2019 scandal.
Suh Pureunhaneul, a restaurant employee in Seoul, summed up popular disaffection with the established parties, especially over the prohibitive cost of housing in the capital.
“It feels like they’re just promoting measures to maintain land prices rather than addressing what I really need,” he said. “Looking at the election, it feels like there’s no one I want to vote for. I wonder if voting would even make a difference.”",2024-04-09T04:55:28Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"US envoy to UN to visit Korean border, North Korean defectors","The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will travel to the heavily armed Korean border and meet North Korean defectors in South Korea, her office said on Monday, amid faltering U.N. efforts to ensure sanctions enforcement against the North.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's trip, set for April 14-20, came after Russia rejected the annual renewal of the multinational panel of experts which has over the past 15 years worked on the implementation of U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo criticised Moscow's veto and China's abstention, which experts said would undermine the sanctions enforcement, with a South Korean envoy likening it to ""destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed.""
Thomas-Greenfield's trip, which will also include a stop in Japan, was meant to advance bilateral and trilateral cooperation on the sanctions and beyond, U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson Nate Evans said. Both South Korea and Japan are currently members of the Security Council.
""In both countries, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield will discuss next steps to ensure a continuation of independent and accurate reporting of the DPRK's ongoing weapons proliferation and sanctions evasion activities,"" Evans said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In South Korea, Thomas-Greenfield will travel to the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas, meet young North Korean defectors as well as students at Ewha Womans University, Evans said.
In Japan, she will also meet family members of Japanese citizens who were abducted in the early 2000s by North Korea, and visit Nagasaki, which was hit by U.S. nuclear bombing in 1945.

Deaths From Doctor Shortage Fuel Election Angst in Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- In March 2023, a 17-year-old girl who fell from a building in the South Korean city of Daegu died after her ambulance was turned away by three hospitals that lacked doctors to treat her.
She was among more than 3,750 patients who have died since 2017 after local hospitals refused to provide care, according to a report by Cheong Yooseok, a professor of medical science at Dankook University in Cheonan city.
The startling statistic from one of Asia’s richest countries has become a major issue in the parliamentary elections taking place on April 10. While the country won acclaim for its low fatality rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus now is on inefficiency, waste and skewed economic incentives in the health-care system.
Renowned medical centers in Seoul are overwhelmed by patients, while the rest of the country struggles with a lack of physicians. A six-week-and-counting national walk-out by nearly 13,000 residents and interns protesting a plan to boost medical school enrollment has exacerbated the situation.
Seung-Pyo Jung, an esophageal cancer patient who lives on Jeju Island in south, flew to Seoul National University Bandung Hospital for surgery last June. While he’s supposed to have checkups every four weeks, sometimes it takes several months to get an appointment.
“There’s no doctor at all on this island who can treat esophageal cancer,"" Jung said of his hometown, which has a population of almost 700,000 people. “Everything is so concentrated in Seoul.""
The Korean Emergency Medical Association, which advocates for doctors working at emergency centers, warned that it may join the protest. Meanwhile, the health ministry said it’s willing to discuss the Korean Medical Association’s efforts to delay the plan to increase medical school enrollment if the group has a scientific, rational and unified proposal.
Health Care Collapse
Korea has among the fewest doctors per capita of all developed countries and hasn’t increased the number of medical students in more than two decades, said Gaetan Lafortune, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Demographic factors like the rapidly aging population will exacerbate the scarcity, he said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed to address the crisis. He proposed measures, like increasing the number of doctors, that have drawn complaints for being “populist moves"" ahead of the election to select the 300 member National Assembly.
While his conservative People Power Party is currently in power, he’s trying to flip dozens of seats held by his progressive rivals, led by the Democratic Party, to take control of the national legislature.
The health-care system is “collapsing,"" Yoon said at a public hearing in February. “Now is the golden time to push reforms.""
Yet the doctors themselves oppose efforts to expand physician supply, arguing that the government’s proposal to increase medical school enrollment by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058 doesn’t address the root problem.
This, they say, is that doctor pay in some critical fields covered by the country’s National Health Insurance system is far lower than that for outside specialists, especially those who do cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. The disparity in compensation and infrastructure between Seoul and rural areas also means a dearth of medical workers outside the capital.

Disappearing Doctors
“Doctors are disappearing at emergency centers, surgery rooms, delivery rooms, and hospitals in smaller cities,"" said Cheong, from Dankook University, in a December report. “Many young doctors gave up becoming fellows at medical colleges and work in the beauty industry.""
Cosmetic surgery has aggressively taken hold and medical tourism is booming in South Korea. More than 8 million foreign patients arrived between 2009 and 2022, many for the beauty industry that offers ubiquitous access to plastic surgery, Botox for $6 per shot, and laser skin tightening.
Meanwhile, essential fields including pediatrics have been hard hit. Only 53 residents applied to fill 205 pediatric slots for this year, and just eight were outside Seoul and its surroundings, according to the health ministry. For pediatric surgery, two trainee doctors applied for spots outside of the greater Seoul area.
In June 2023, the Korean Pediatric Society held a conference titled “How to Exit Pediatrics"" focused on learning about other disciplines including cosmetic surgery. The seminar was done at the behest of members who said the country’s ultra-low birth rate made it difficult to run pediatric clinics, officials said in a television interview with Channel A.
Outside Seoul
The situation is dire in most parts of the country.
More than half of Korea’s 114,000 doctors and dentists worked in Seoul or Gyeonggi province in 2022, according to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.
Hiring doctors outside the capital is tough, said Cho Seung-yeon, president of Incheon Medical Center. He couldn’t find anyone to lead the dialysis division for two years. Another public hospital offered $1 million for a cardiologist, he said.
Salaried doctors at private clinics can earn in excess of $300,000 annually, while those on their own make even more, he said. Cho offers $200,000 a year for physicians at his public hospital in Incheon, but he said few ultimately come.
Even in Seoul, medical care can be tenuous given the doctor shortage.
Kim Sung Ju, a 62-year-old who underwent surgery for esophageal cancer a decade ago, undergoes a battery of tests and waits hours for a brief visit with his doctor at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital in Gangnam, an upscale neighborhood in the city’s southeast, every three months.
“I really don’t understand why I have to visit this big hospital every three months, because I only get to talk to my doctor for three minutes,"" he said. “I had thought Korea’s health insurance system, with private doctors and national health insurance, was the world’s best, but now it’s becoming the world’s worst.""
A more robust medical work force is also essential to the country’s public health, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which has just 20 doctors out of 500 employees.
“We hope just two doctors join us a year,"" said Hong Jeong-ik, director-general of the bureau of public health emergency preparedness. “They can do something meaningful for the public, even if that may not help them make huge a profit.""
Amid the national debate, wait times for care have worsened since the doctors’ walkout to protest Yoon’s proposed reforms. The president says he won’t back down on what he calls a “minimum requirement"" for fixing the underlying issues. Nearly four-in-five Koreans support the expansion, polling ahead of the election shows.
“A nurse died in August 2022 at the one of Korea’s best hospitals, where she worked, because there was no doctor to treat her,"" Health and Welfare Minister Cho KyooHong said in an interview. “This is not right.""

Biden’s Envoy to the UN Set to Visit Border With North Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- The US ambassador to the United Nations will travel to the North Korean border as the Biden administration looks to reaffirm support for Asian allies and draw attention to a breakdown in Security Council unity over efforts to rein in Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will become the most senior US official to visit the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas since Vice President Kamala Harris went there in 2022. US mission spokesman Nate Evans said it’s part of a bigger week-long trip to South Korea and Japan, both of which are current members of the Security Council.
While the trip has been planned for some time, Thomas-Greenfield heads to the region soon after Russia vetoed a US-led Security Council resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of experts that has monitored North Korea’s nuclear-weapons development for 15 years. She’ll also be in Washington DC this week for a US summit with the leaders of Japan and the Philippines.
Such extensions were once routine but have run up against growing divisions in the council between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine and what the US says is Moscow’s push to secure weapons and ammunition from Pyongyang. North Korea also continues to make progress on its nuclear program in defiance of numerous Security Council resolutions.
Thomas-Greenfield will be briefed by military officials at the demilitarized zone. She also plans to meet civilians, including North Korean defectors, during her trip to South Korea, Evans said.
Thomas-Greenfield will also head to Japan, where she will meet officials to discuss shared priorities at the UN. She’ll also hear from family members of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Un’s regime.
(Updates with ambassador traveling to DC for summit in third paragraph. A previous version of this story corrected to say the US envoy will meet defectors during her South Korea visit, not at the DMZ.)

"China might use AI to disrupt the forthcoming US election, says Microsoft","What you need to know
Microsoft has published a report highlighting how China is leveraging AI to disrupt elections across South Korea, India, and the US.
The tech giant details that China's threat to the electoral process ""remains low"" but warns it could get severe with time as its deceitful ploys become more sophisticated.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had previously indicated that there's enough power to protect the integrity of the US presidential election, alongside the company's plan to empower voters with authoritative news regarding the election via Bing.
With the prevalence of generative AI and chatbots, misinformation is becoming more widespread. Microsoft recently shared a new report highlighting how China is misappropriating the tech, spanning from AI-generated memes designed to fuel outrage over Japan's disposal of nuclear wastewater to spreading malicious rumors indicating that the US government is behind the tragic wildfire in Hawaii and Kentucky's train derailment.
According to the tech giant:
""As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections.""
Further in the report, Microsoft indicated that it anticipates China will leverage AI-based ploys to interfere with high-profile elections this year. Several social media accounts believed to belong to Chinese users have been spotted spreading politically concocted AI-generated information. Moreover, the accounts would ask followers to interact with the posts by asking which presidential candidate they are supporting.
Microsoft speculates that China intends to use its position and AI to brew more chaos, ultimately allowing it to benefit from the high-profile elections. While the tech giant indicates the issue isn't severe, it warns the situation is highly likely to change:
""While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line.""
Microsoft's report complements the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's threat assessment of China. Both reports mentioned Storm-1376, a Beijing-based group known as ""Spamouflage"" that is believed to be behind Taiwan's electoral process disruptions via AI-generated content.

What's Microsoft doing to prevent the issue from becoming widespread?
(Image credit: Daniel Rubino | Bing Image Creator)
Last year, Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) was spotted misleading voters and users with false information regarding the forthcoming US election. Researchers indicated that the issue was systemic, after establishing a pattern. The chatbot had also been spotted providing false information about the election process in Germany and Switzerland.
But Microsoft has been putting elaborate measures and ramping up it efforts to prevent this situation from spiraling out of control. Earlier this year while in speaking in an interview, Microsoft CEO indicated there's 'enough technology' to protect the US presidential election from AI deepfakes and misinformation.
Microsoft had already indicated that it plans to empower voters with authoritative and factual election news on Bing ahead of the poll. Bing growth continues to stagnate despite Microsoft's hefty investment in AI, while Google dominates the search landscape.",2024-04-08T16:53:16Z,https://www.windowscentral.com,Windows Central

（中央社首爾8日綜合外電報導）韓國業界人士今天透露，中國電商巨擘「拼多多」旗下跨境平台Temu因涉廣告不實和不公平商業行為，正遭韓國公平交易委員會（Korea Fair Trade Commission，KFTC）調查。
韓聯社報導，Temu於今年2月成立韓國分公司Whaleco Korea LLC，並在當地大舉搶攻市場。但由於該公司尚未正式開始運作，目前公平會的調查仍以書面形式為限。
據悉，調查旨在確認Temu是否違反「電子商務交易法」規定的消費者保護義務，以及「標示廣告公正化法」有關不實或誇大廣告的條款。
自去年7月進軍韓國以來，Temu透過發放折價券等方式吸引新會員，並因採用類似賭博的輪盤遊戲及直銷手段而引發爭議。與此同時，該平台的出貨延遲和商品品質不佳等問題也讓不少消費者不滿。
阿里巴巴旗下的全球速賣通（AliExpress）和Temu先後遭韓國當局調查後，有人認為公平會可能將調查範圍擴及所有中國電商平台。公平會則表示，不便針對調查中的案件透露資訊，但若發現違法行為將從嚴處罰。

South Korea says second spy satellite placed in orbit,"As it stands now, polls have Trump and Biden effectively tied, meaning that there’s an opportunity, some might call it a moral imperative, to sway the country away from the dystopian future in which Trump triumphs.
But how exactly do we change voters’ minds?
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
One might believe it’s just a matter of making a persuasive argument, loaded with empirical facts and sound logic, articulated with perfect clarity. This is what the left-wing media often believes, and we have seen how successful that strategy has been — Donald Trump is as influential as ever.
But what if I told you that our neural wiring determines whether we have the ability to change our minds? What if I told you that science suggests conservatives, who are extremely likely to be voting for Trump this election, generally have more rigid cognitive systems, which means they are less adaptable, and therefore, less likely to adopt a new framework or perspective when their approach fails?
A seminal study by social psychologist David Amodio and colleagues at New York University suggests that the typical conservative is not likely to be convinced by something as simple as a logically persuasive argument. For some conservatives, it's like asking them to change the color of their eyes. A progressive worldview cannot pierce their psyche because being dogmatic is programmed into the fabric of that worldview. It is not just that they are “stubborn”; their brains are actually wired to resist things that are new and different. So, you could say they lack “free will” when it comes to their voting decision. When we speak of free will in a modern sense, we are talking about the personal agency that enables one to override ingrained biases and consider alternative perspectives.
To understand the implications of this study, we must voyage into the realm of neuroscience, where secrets of the mind await discovery. The ERN, which stands for “error related negativity,” is a spike in brain activity that is triggered when we commit an error. It serves as a kind of internal alert system within our brain, signaling when a mistake has been made. It emerges in the brain region known as the anterior cingulate cortex, which helps us navigate situations where established patterns or behaviors are ineffective and require adjustment. For example, if a person is learning to play a musical instrument and hits a wrong note, the ERN might spike, prompting them to correct their finger positioning and playing style. Over time, as they practice and adapt, the frequency of these ERN spikes will decrease, indicating improved proficiency and fewer mistakes.
RELATED: This complete psychological analysis reveals 14 key traits that explain Trump supporters
Armed with a knowledge of the nature of the ERN, Dr. Amodio and colleagues ventured into the terrain of politics. Their highly-cited 2007 study revealed an illuminating connection between one's political orientation and the intensity of the ERN response. What they found was that participants with liberal views exhibited a more pronounced ERN. This suggests they have a heightened sensitivity to error signals, indicating a cognitive system that acknowledges the need for adjustments in perspective and strategy. Essentially, when their established behavioral patterns were shown to be incorrect or suboptimal, their brains signaled more intensely for an adaptive response. From these findings, we can conclude that progressive-minded individuals possess a neural predisposition for recognizing the need for change and growth.
Conservatives, on the other hand, exhibited a smaller ERN. This suggests that their cognitive system is more resistant to signals advocating for change or reconsideration. We can think of this as a neural reflection of their preference for stability, tradition and consistency. The typical conservative voter’s mental landscape, sculpted by a combination of genetics and indoctrinating experiences, values the familiar and reliable. Established norms and long-held beliefs provide a safe harbor in the face of a changing society and an uncertain future. It's a mindset where radical shifts or sudden upheavals are perceived not as opportunities but threats to a delicate equilibrium. Conservatism is essentially a neurocognitive inclination aimed at preserving the status quo.
So, what are we supposed to take away from these results? Does it mean there’s no hope for shifting anyone’s stances this election?
One might reasonably conclude that we should simply focus on getting all those already on our ideological side to turn out to the polls on voting day.
But using that strategy alone is risky. We should not give up hope in spreading a progressive worldview, because resistance to change and evolution eventually leads to societal collapse. History has unequivocally demonstrated that. Adaptivity is the key to individual and collective survival. This means we have an ethical obligation to be evangelists for progress and sensible change. This will require a bit of social engineering and some creativity.
Persuading the conservatives intending to vote for Trump is not about convincing them with logic; it is about understanding and navigating their innate preference for stability and tradition. By recognizing the inherent gravitation toward consistency, we see that the presentation of facts or data might not be the most persuasive tool. Effective persuasion demands an approach that's strategically empathetic. Rather than challenging the core of their beliefs head-on, it’s far more effective to frame arguments in a way that resonates with their intrinsic values — stability, tradition and consistency. Narratives and stories that weave in those facts that resonate with their core values will be more compelling. Presenting change not as a rupture, but as a natural evolution of the existing order, can be a more palatable and effective narrative.
To truly sway Republican voters, we must employ more than just arguments. It demands a properly balanced mix of genuine empathy, clever communication strategy and a basic grasp of the neurocognitive biases shaping their perspectives.
In the end, the outcome of the election may well hinge on our ability to navigate the cognitive labyrinth of the conservative mind.

South Korea launches its second military spy satellite,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea has successfully launched its second military spy satellite into orbit, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year — North Korea in November and South Korea in December — amid heightened animosities. They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.
South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the satellite entered orbit and communicated with an overseas ground station after separation from a rocket.
“With the success of the second military spy satellite launch, our military has acquired an additional independent surveillance ability and further bolstered our ‘kill chain’ capability,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha Gyu told reporters, referring to the military’s preemptive missile strike capability.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025. South Korea’s first spy satellite launch on Dec. 1 was made from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base.
South Korea in 2022 became the world’s 10th nation to successfully launch a satellite with its own technology by using a homegrown rocket to place what it called a “performance observation satellite” in orbit. But experts say it’s economical to use a SpaceX rocket to launch spy satellite and that South Korea needs more launches to ensure the reliability of a rocket.
North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik said Monday that North Korea will likely go ahead with its second spy satellite launch soon to mark the April 15 birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Shin said it’s still possible for the North to perform the launch later due to technical reasons.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response.

SEOUL, April 8 (UPI) -- South Korea successfully placed its second military reconnaissance satellite into orbit, Seoul's military said Monday, a move that will heighten surveillance capabilities against North Korea amid a growing space race on the peninsula. The launch took place on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which was Monday morning in Seoul, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a press release. Advertisement
The satellite was carried on a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and successfully entered orbit around 45 minutes after launch. It later succeeded in communicating with a ground station, the ministry said.
In addition to increased surveillance capacity, the satellite will enhance South Korea's ""Kill Chain"" system, the ministry added. The Kill Chain is part of a three-pronged deterrence strategy that calls for preemptive strikes against the North's missiles -- and possibly its leadership -- in the event of a potential attack.
Monday's launch marked the second of five military reconnaissance satellites that Seoul has contracted with SpaceX to place into orbit by 2025. South Korea launched its first satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Dec. 1, less than two weeks after North Korea placed its own inaugural spy satellite into orbit.

The new satellite is equipped with synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, which can capture images at night and under any weather conditions, defense officials said.
""With the success of this launch, our military has further strengthened its space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,"" South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said after viewing a live stream of the launch at ministry headquarters. ""Now, even in bad weather, it has become possible to monitor the whole of North Korea clearly and precisely.""
North Korea announced plans last week to launch several more spy satellites of its own this year, amid concerns over its growing military relationship with Russia.
Washington and its allies say that Pyongyang is shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
Shin said that the South's satellite technology is far superior to that of the North and promised that upcoming launches will further widen the gap in the space race.
""By next year, we plan to launch a follow-up military reconnaissance satellite and an ultra-small satellite that is currently under development,"" he said. ""We will have an overwhelming intelligence superiority that cannot be compared with North Korea.""",2024-04-08T06:06:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

South Korea has launched its second military spy satellite into space, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year – North Korea in November and South Korea in December – amid heightened animosities. They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.
South Korea’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that the satellite was successfully separated from a rocket. It said it will check whether the satellite functions properly via its communications with an overseas ground station.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025. South Korea’s first spy satellite launch on Dec. 1 was made from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base.
South Korea in 2022 became the world’s 10th nation to successfully launch a satellite with its own technology by using a homegrown rocket to place what it called a “performance observation satellite” in orbit. But experts say it’s economical to use a SpaceX rocket to launch spy satellite and that South Korea needs more launches to ensure the reliability of a rocket.
North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response. Experts say North Korea likely believes that an enlarged weapons arsenals would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.",2024-04-08T03:46:01Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail
Japan’s pivot away from peace reflects new world order,"In 2022, Japan announced its biggest military build-up since World War II with an ambitious five-year spending plan that included buying missiles capable of striking China. Japan is earmarking a record ¥7.7 trillion ($77 billion) for its defence budget in fiscal 2024 in what local media are calling an “intense arms buildup”. The government wants to expand its annual defence budget to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027, from just 1 per cent now.
Reimagining its security alliances in an increasingly hostile region is the next logical step in Japan’s defence push.

To this end, Japan is poised to be included in the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine alliance with Australia, the US and the United Kingdom, a widely flagged idea likely to be formalised when Kishida meets President Joe Biden in Washington this week.
There is some irony in this, given Australia dumped Japan in 2016 in favour of France to build its new submarine fleet. However, Japan’s inclusion will be limited to the Pillar II elements of the alliance covering military technology. It will have nothing to do with the nuclear-powered submarine element of the pact.
It also cements a shift in the way Japan wants to manage its other alliances in the region.

Japan sees Australia as a key partner and no longer wants to solely rely on the US as its key protector. It is also boosting defence ties with South Korea despite the countries’ historical grievances.
A key driver for the flurry of activity is a sense that time is running out for both leaders.
Kishida’s popularity ratings are in the toilet, and he is unlikely to be around in a year, while the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House in November leaves a question mark over US-Japan defence ties.
Talk of welcoming Japan into an alliance that many in Tokyo joke should be renamed JAUKUS has been around since the alliance was first announced in 2021. Japan’s former prime minister Taro Aso advocated the move in a speech in Canberra late last year.
Strategically, Japan’s role as a partner in aspects of AUKUS covering military technology makes sense given its advanced manufacturing and defence capabilities.
“Japan has a lot to contribute in certain areas: space technologies and missile
technologies, anti-submarine and undersea surveillance technologies, hypersonics, [and] submarine technology just to name a few, and it’s advanced manufacturing is world-class,” says Grant Newsham, a senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies.

“And don’t forget that Japan has got a lot of money to invest in all this. It’s not as if the British and the Australians are rolling in dough they can invest in defence. Even the Americans claim to be tapped out when it comes to defence.”
A key obstacle until recently has been Japan’s inferior cybersecurity and counter-espionage capabilities, which have lagged those of the US, Australia and UK. Japan is not a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network.
The other hurdle has been Japan’s pacific constitution, which allows the country to defend itself but not to attack.
Japan has already shown its willingness to skirt these restrictions by providing surface-to-air missiles to the United States as part of indirect military aid to Ukraine.
While Kishida has failed to shine in many aspects of Japanese policymaking, diplomats and analysts say defence is the exception.
His popularity ratings, currently at record lows following a funding scandal in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), peaked when he visited Ukraine in March last year. His advisers hope this week’s trip to Washington will give him a much-needed boost in the pools.

Importantly, the Japanese people seem to be on board with Kishida’s more hawkish approach to global security.
They are increasingly concerned about the country’s hostile neighbours and whether Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sets a precedent for Beijing to make territorial claims over nearby Taiwan, and even over Japanese territory such as the island chain of Okinawa. Russia, too, has claims over Japan’s so-called “Northern Territories”.
In a rare interview with US media outlets, Kishida made it clear what his driving Japan’s shift in strategy.
“As we are witnessing Russia’s Ukraine aggression, the continuing situation over the Middle East, as well as the situation in East Asia, we are faced with a historic turning point,” Kishida told CNN on Sunday.
“That is why Japan has made a decision to fundamentally reinforce its defence capabilities, and we have greatly changed Japan’s security policy on these fronts,” he said.",2024-04-08T02:43:57Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review

"Global fact-checkers battle harassment, threats, financial perils","From India and South Korea to Croatia and North Macedonia, fact-checking organizations battling an ever-rising tide of misinformation in a major election year are buffeted by legal threats, harassment and funding shortfalls.Fact-checkers, largely under-resourced and increasingly under attack, have their work cut out this year as dozens of countries hold elections, a period when falsehoods typically explode.Debunking fake political claims and hoaxes that threaten election integrity, likened by some researchers as a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole, comes with a litany of challenges that are piling pressure on fact-checkers in a crucial year.The most significant is raising funds to sustain operations, according to a new survey by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) of 137 organizations across 69 countries.The Seoul National University (SNU) FactCheck Center, South Korea's only local debunking platform, faces possible shutdown after its biggest donor -- the search engine company Naver -- pulled financial support last year.Naver declined to comment on the reason, but the outfit's director Chong Eun-ryung believes ""political pressure"" from the ruling People Power Party was the ""biggest factor.""SNU FactCheck Center has been accused of bias by ruling party lawmakers, a charge it rejects.The development follows the closure of another outfit, Fact-check Net, last year after the government cut off its funding.'Information warfare'""Fact-checkers are facing growing amounts of misinformation with limited resources for reporting and publishing,"" Angie Drobnic Holan, director of IFCN, told AFP.""There are also campaigns of online and legal harassment against fact-checkers from those who prefer more cutthroat information warfare, without checks based on evidence and logic.""The IFCN survey said about 72 percent of organizations faced harassment, while many also reported physical and legal threats.Croatian fact-checking website Faktograf.hr has been forced to invest in security measures after its staff received death threats and female reporters faced sexist insults, executive director Ana Brakus told AFP.A text message received by one staff member warned that his fingers would be ""cut off.""""We had to find ways to deal with that kind of stress"" without affecting the fact-checking mission, Brakus said, adding the organization offered mental health support to its staff.In India, home to the largest number of certified fact-checkers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- tipped to win a third consecutive term in upcoming parliamentary elections -- has been accused of stifling independent media.Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of Alt News and a frequent target of government rebuke, continues to face legal threats after being briefly jailed in 2022 over accusations that he insulted a Hindi god in a tweet four years earlier.During a fundraising drive on X, formerly Twitter, Zubair wrote Indian media organizations were being ""forced to censor themselves"" and in some cases, ""becoming government mouthpieces.""'Existential threats'With their shoestring budgets, many fact-checkers must turn to external funding support to defend themselves against the ""existential threats"" that lawsuits -- often frivolous -- present, the IFCN report said.In some cases, fact-checkers are themselves targeted by disinformation.Truthmeter, the fact-checking service of the North Macedonia-based Metamorphosis Foundation, faced a sweeping smear campaign earlier this year after its fact-checks of Facebook posts prompted accusations that it was censoring content.The campaign, the group said in a note to readers, escalated into insults, slander and ""badly disguised calls for violence"" against its staff.""We are fully aware that such disinformation campaigns, full of attacks, manipulations, threats and hate speech will continue, especially in the pre-election period,"" it said, as North Macedonia gears up for the presidential race later this month.Content moderation on social media has become a hot-button issue even in advanced economies such as the United States -- which faces elections in November -- with many users equating fact-checking with censorship.""'Who fact-checks the fact-checkers?' is a common response to our work,"" said Eric Litke, who heads a US-based fact-checker, stressing the need for transparency to gain reader trust.Fact-checking organizations, including AFP -- which debunks misinformation as part of Meta's third-party fact-checking program -- routinely face online abuse from people who dispute their ratings, sometimes even when they peddle blatantly false information.""I've watched this movement label fact-checkers as part of a 'censorship industrial complex,'"" said Holan.""Ironically, this deeply misleading argument itself is aimed at suppressing critique and debate.""",2024-04-08T02:03:00Z,https://www.deccanchronicle.com,Deccan Chronicle
South Korea’s spring festivals disappoint as cherry trees blossom late,"CHANGWON - South Korea’s flower festivals in 2024 have so far fallen short of expectations as cherry trees did not reach their blossom peak in time.
The Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival Day Tour in Changwon, South Gyeongsang province, saw a drop of about 1.2 million visitors in 2024, a Changwon official told South Korean media.
While 4.2 million people visited the most well-known cherry blossom festival in South Korea in 2023, the city tallied the number of visitors at three million during the 10 days of the 2024 festival, which ended on April 1.
The blooms were expected on 360,000 trees planted in the area’s parks and naval bases, but the blooming rate remained at only 15 per cent on March 23, the first day of the festival.
Other famous cherry blossom festivals, including those in Yeouido and Jamsil in Seoul, also ended with many of the flowers still in the bud stage. The number of visitors to the Yeouido festival was less than half of 2023’s figure, according to media reports.
The festivals’ dates had been brought forward compared with previous years’ as the date when the flowers bloom has gradually become earlier. For 2024, it was forecast to be even earlier.
Festivals in Changwon and Seoul were brought forward by a week from the previous year.
But this March saw colder temperatures and less sunshine than average, which experts say resulted in inaccurate earlier forecasts on bloom peaks.
The inaccurate predictions were embarrassing for the authorities as the spring festivals have been an important opportunity for local businesses to promote their products.
Some cities decided to postpone their spring festivals, or even hold another festival.
Sokcho city in Gangwon province launched a second cherry blossom festival on April 6, a week after its first festival ended.
A post uploaded on the city’s social media account reads: “We deserve to die for our mistake, but we could not control the season.” The city explained it had to hold the festival twice because of the lack of blossoms.
Gangneung city in Gangwon province also opened its Gyeongpo Cherry Blossom Festival on April 6, after delaying it by a week from March 29. THE KOREA HERALD/ ASIA NEWS NETWORK",2024-04-08T00:20:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
Reports of workplace abuse in South Korea double over past 5 years,"SEOUL – More than 10,000 cases of workplace abuse were reported to the authorities in 2023, the labour ministry said on April 7, marking a steep increase every year since the government started compiling such reports in 2019.
According to the Ministry of Employment and Labour, it received 10,028 reports of workplace abuse in 2023, up 12 per cent from 8,961 the year before.
South Korea in 2019 revised the Labour Standards Act to stipulate in Articles 76-2 and 76-3 the prohibition against workplace harassment and the appropriate measures to be taken in such cases.
The ministry started keeping track of reports of workplace abuse in the second half of 2019, during which 2,130 cases were reported.
In the following years, the figure reached 5,823 in 2020 and 7,774 in 2021, and is continuing its upward trajectory.
The most common form of workplace harassment reported in 2023 was verbal abuse at 32.8 per cent, followed by inappropriate measures related to human resources at 13.8 per cent.
Of the 10,028 reported cases in 2024, officials took action on 9,672 cases, while 356 cases are still being processed.
In 2,884 cases, those accused of workplace abuse had been found to not have violated the law or the case itself did not occur in a workplace subject to the Labour Standard Act. The act can be applied to workplaces that regularly employ at least five people.
In 2,197 cases, the accuser had dropped the charges.
Only 57 cases led to an indictment as the law specifies criminal punishment only for the act of the employer firing or unfavourably treating the employee who reported an incident of workplace abuse, which can be punished by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won (S$30,000).
The maximum punishment for other violations is a 10 million won administrative fine, which does not remain on the offender’s criminal record.
Surveys indicate that the actual number of workplace abuse incidents is much higher than what the government report suggests, but many employees facing such abuse do not report it for fear of retribution.
In February, local pollster Hankook Research announced the results of its survey of 1,000 employees across the country, which showed that 46 per cent of respondents have experienced some level of abuse at work.
About 33 per cent of them said they chose to do nothing, while 31 per cent said they quit their job and 25 per cent said they sought help from those around them.
Only 8 per cent reported the case to organisations outside the company.
The same survey showed that 96 per cent of respondents thought that the legal clause banning workplace harassment should be applied to all workers, including those working for an employer with less than five employees.

Deaths from doctor shortage fuel election angst in South Korea,"SEOUL – In March 2023, a 17-year-old girl who fell from a building in the South Korean city of Daegu died after her ambulance was turned away by three hospitals that lacked doctors to treat her.
She was among more than 3,750 patients who have died since 2017 after local hospitals refused to provide care, according to a report by Professor Cheong Yooseok from Dankook University in Cheonan city.
The startling statistic from one of Asia’s richest countries has become a major issue in the parliamentary elections taking place on April 10. While the country won acclaim for its low fatality rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus now is on inefficiency, waste and skewed economic incentives in the healthcare system.
Renowned medical centres in Seoul are overwhelmed by patients, while the rest of the country struggles with a lack of physicians. A six-week-and-counting national walk-out by nearly 13,000 residents and interns protesting a plan to boost medical school enrolment has exacerbated the situation.
Mr Jung Seung-pyo, an esophageal cancer patient who lives on Jeju Island, flew to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for surgery in June 2023. While he is supposed to have check-ups every four weeks, sometimes it takes several months to get an appointment.
“There’s no doctor at all on this island who can treat esophageal cancer,” Mr Jung said of his hometown, which has a population of almost 700,000 people. “Everything is so concentrated in Seoul.”
South Korea has among the fewest doctors per capita of all developed countries and has not increased the number of medical students in more than two decades, said Mr Gaetan Lafortune, a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Demographic factors like the rapidly ageing population will exacerbate the scarcity, he said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has vowed to address the crisis. He proposed measures, like increasing the number of doctors, that have drawn complaints for being “populist moves” ahead of the election to select the 300-member National Assembly.
While his conservative People Power Party is currently in power, he is trying to flip dozens of seats held by his progressive rivals, led by the Democratic Party, to take control of the national legislature.
The healthcare system is “collapsing”, Mr Yoon said at a public hearing in February. “Now is the golden time to push reforms.”
Yet the doctors themselves oppose efforts to expand physician supply, arguing that the government’s proposal to increase medical school enrolment by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058 does not address the root problem.
This, they say, is that doctor pay in some critical fields covered by the country’s National Health Insurance system is far lower than that for outside specialists, especially those who do cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. The disparity in compensation and infrastructure between Seoul and rural areas also means a dearth of medical workers outside the capital.
“Doctors are disappearing at emergency centres, surgery rooms, delivery rooms, and hospitals in smaller cities,” said Prof Cheong in a December report. “Many young doctors gave up becoming fellows at medical colleges and work in the beauty industry.”
Cosmetic surgery has aggressively taken hold and medical tourism is booming in South Korea. More than 8 million foreign patients arrived between 2009 and 2022, many for the beauty industry that offers ubiquitous access to plastic surgery, Botox for US$6 (S$8) per shot, and laser skin tightening.
Meanwhile, essential fields including pediatrics have been hard hit. Only 53 residents applied to fill 205 paediatric slots for 2024, and just eight were outside Seoul and its surroundings, according to the health ministry. For paediatric surgery, two trainee doctors applied for spots outside of the greater Seoul area.",2024-04-07T23:15:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times

Våpnene brukes i stor skala mot ukrainske mål, sivile som militære. Takket være disse dronene, missilene og ammunisjon, klarer Putins krigsmaskin å holde seg flytende.
Det er dette som nå bekymrer Ukrainas allierte, spesielt USA og Nato.

Although the current influence of such content on audience perspectives is limited, China’s ongoing exploration of enhancing memes, videos, and audio could potentially become more impactful in the future, according to the analysis.
These concerns come in the wake of reports of Chinese cyber and influence actors engaging in espionage and operations across various regions. These cyber actors have refined their methods, utilising AI-generated content to sow discord within the US and exacerbate tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, including Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, Watts highlighted in the blog post.
In the blog post titled China Tests US Voter Fault Lines and Ramps AI Content to Boost Its Geopolitical Interests, Watts discusses the specific topics where China has used AI-generated content to gauge voters’ mindsets ahead of elections.
These topics include the train derailment in Kentucky in November 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, the disposal of Japanese nuclear wastewater, drug use in the US as well as immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.
Watts also noted that during the Taiwanese presidential election in January, there was a notable increase in the utilisation of AI-generated content to enhance information operations by actors affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — marking the first time that Microsoft Threat Intelligence witnessed a nation-state actor using AI content in attempts to influence a foreign election.
Since at least February 2023, the group identified as Storm-1376 has significantly increased its use of AI-generated news anchors, the analysis highlighted.
It added that this tactic of using AI to alter videos has been previously deployed against the same dissident. Moreover, Storm-1376 launched a sequence of AI-generated memes targeting William Lai, the candidate of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the presidential race, illustrating a countdown to the DPP’s removal from authority, it said.
According to the analysis, however, there is limited evidence available regarding the potential impact of these developments on India’s election.

The West is in more danger than it has ever been in, the head of NATO said in a dire warning on Saturday as he warned of an ""alliance of authoritarian powers"" working against the West's democracies.
Jens Stoltenberg highlighted the ever-strengthening relations between Russia, Iran, China and North Korea as he warned that the world is ""more dangerous"" and ""much more unpredictable"" and ""violent"" than it ever has been in an interview with the BBC.
""China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and, in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg.

Russia is also providing technology to both Iran and North Korea in exchange for ammunition and military equipment, the NATO Secretary General noted, which is an incredibly dangerous trade amid the ongoing war in Ukraine sparked by a Russian invasion in February 2022 and the raging conflict in Gaza, sparked by Iranian-backed militant group Hamas' invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, which was followed by intense retaliation by Israel.

The US and its NATO allies are on the side of Israel and Ukraine, while Iran, Russia, North Korea and, to a lesser extent, China, are on the side of Russia and Hamas, though the Gaza conflict is more complicated than the one playing out in Ukraine.
Essentially, danger stems from the possibility of a NATO country becoming fully involved in a conflict that one of the so-called ""authoritarian"" countries have their hands in, as an all-out war could break out, becoming World War III.

That's what the US and its allies fear now after Israel launched a deadly airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, killing seven of the country's top officials as Iran vowed to seek revenge against not only Israel but also demanded the US be held responsible for the strike.
NATO is hoping to send a ""very clear message"" to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Stoltenberg said, as the bloc urges the country to do ""significantly more"" to reduce civilian casualties in the conflict.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have killed more than 33,000 people in the conflict so far, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, and many of them have been women and children. The IDF's incessant bombing of hospitals and refugee camps in the region has led to mass casualties as dozens are killed in strikes that are meant to slay just one person.
The war in Ukraine is another story. The US and its NATO allies have been providing aid to the country as it wars with Russia — which is essentially what the treaty bloc was established for, to keep Russia at bay amid the Cold War decades ago.
(Image: KCNA via KNS)
Stoltenberg told the BBC that he's urging NATO and its allies to provide more funding to the region but that there's only so much NATO can do to help its ally, which he said will have to be OK with some ""compromises"".
A long-term funding deal is expected to be reached by members of the military alliance in July, he said as he tirelessly continues to lobby member states to fork up more money for the Ukrainian war effort. He wants to provide €100 billion (£86billion) to the country, but many countries, the US included, have been reluctant to contribute enough to meet that total.
He added: ""Even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future, we need to support Ukraine for many years, to build their defences to deter future aggression."" But Ukraine itself will need to chip in, too, he said.
Stoltenberg said NATO allies are working with other allied countries around the world, including Japan and South Korea, to stave off aggression from the ""stronger alliance of authoritarian powers"".

South Korea’s Election Is About ‘Gladiator Politics’,"The elections are ostensibly about the 300 seats in Parliament, but when South Koreans go to the polls on Wednesday, they will also be signaling support for one of two leaders who are locked in what is known here as “gladiator politics.”
The do-or-die rivalry between President Yoon Suk Yeol and the opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds the majority in the National Assembly, has made the elections as fraught with fear and resentment as any in South Korea​n history. Neither leader commands broad popularity, instead relying on hard-line supporters who either want to see Mr. Yoon, a conservative, impeached for abuse of power, or Mr. Lee, a progressive, imprisoned for corruption.
“This election is about who you want to punish, Yoon Suk Yeol or Lee Jae-myung,” said Eom Kyeong-young, an election analyst at the Zeitgeist Institute in Seoul.
On the global stage, South Korea is the dynamic exporter of cars, phones, K-pop and K-dramas. But at home, voter discontent runs deep. The country’s economy is slowing. Its birthrate is the world’s lowest. Its Gen Z youth — frustrated with widening economic inequity and priced out of the housing market — fear that they will be the first generation in the country’s history economically worse off than their parents.",2024-04-07T04:01:14Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
Leona Maguire makes matchplay semi-finals in Las Vegas,"Ireland's Leona Maguire watches the drive of Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn during their quarter-final match at the T-Mobile Match Play at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas, Nevada. Photograph: Orlando Ramirez/Getty Images
Leona Maguire won through to the semi-finals of the T-Mobile Matchplay Championship at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas for a second straight year as she saw off Thailand’s Moriya Jutanugarn 4&3 on Saturday.
Maguire, who gained the number one ranking after topping the scoring after three rounds of strokeplay, was two up inside three holes, but Jutanugarn stole a hole back with a birdie four on the par-five fourth.
A par on the short fifth was enough for Maguire to regain her two-hole lead and it became three up after a birdie two on the eighth. Back-to-back pars on the 11th and 12th to Jutanugarn’s bogeys put Maguire five up with six to play.
Jutanugarn did enjoy one further success on the 14th with a par to Maguire’s bogey but a par at the next sealed victory for the Cavan golfer with three holes left to play.

Maguire will face Sei Young Kim in the semi-finals after the South Korean got the better of an out of sorts Rose Zhang by 6&5, the young American star seven over for the 13 holes of their match.
Nelly Korda’s sensational form continued with a 3&2 win over fellow American Angel Yin as she looks to make it four tournament wins in a row. She will now face South Korea’s Narin An in the last four after her one hole win over Japan’s Minami Katsu.
A third-round 69 for a total of six-under-par 210 gave Maguire a three-stroke margin over the trio of Zhang, Yin and Katsu following the strokeplay, but all those scores are binned headed into the matchplay element of the innovative tournament on the LPGA Tour.
Maguire described heading the qualifiers as a “big mental win” in difficult, windy conditions with firm greens, where her patience on shot execution stood to her.
“It was so challenging and swirly and the winds and stuff, you couldn’t really get too far ahead or focus on anything other than the shot at hand, which I think was quite nice. I personally didn’t watch the leaderboards. I know Dermot [Byrne] was keeping an eye on them if we needed to do something. I kind of leave that to him and was trying to hit as many good shots as I could,” explained Maguire of her own mindset in navigating a route into the knock-outs.
Maguire was third in last year’s event and has again felt very much at home in the desert: “I love this golf course. I think it’s one of the best, if not the best, golf course we play all year. It’s an unbelievable test. It’s really a Major championship golf course. You get punished if you hit bad shots and get rewarded if you hit good shots, and that’s exactly how golf should be I think. I really enjoy the test that it brings. Looking forward to another day [against Jutanugarn].",2024-04-06T19:44:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times
"China might use AI to influence elections in India, US, South Korea, Microsoft warns","“With significant elections unfolding worldwide, particularly in India, South Korea, and the United States, we anticipate that China will leverage AI-generated content to influence outcomes in its favor,” the blog highlighted
In a recent blog post, software giant Microsoft has raised concerns about China’s potential use of AI-generated content to advance its interests, especially with major elections scheduled in countries like India, South Korea, and the United States this year.
The blog, drawing insights from Microsoft Threat Intelligence, references the latest East Asia report titled “Same targets, new playbooks: East Asia threat actors employ unique methods.”

“With significant elections unfolding worldwide, particularly in India, South Korea, and the United States, we anticipate that China will leverage AI-generated content to influence outcomes in its favor,” the blog highlighted.
The report also highlights the involvement of North Korean cyber threat actors in targeting elections in these three countries.
Microsoft’s findings suggest that while the immediate impact of China’s AI-generated content on election results may be limited, ongoing experimentation and the augmentation of memes and videos could potentially yield more effective results in the future.
“Although the likelihood of such content directly impacting election outcomes is currently low, China’s increasing experimentation with memes, videos, and audio augmentation is expected to persist and could prove increasingly influential over time,” the blog concluded.
Government quickly sprung into action to check AI-generated deepfakes after a fake video of Bollywood actor Rashmika Mandanna went viral.

Further, the Ministry of Electronics and IT issued dedicated guidelines for AI-generated content after a controversy erupted over a response of Google’s AI platform to queries related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Microsoft’s threat intelligence report shared screenshots of AI-generated videos in Mandarin and English which alleged that the US and India were responsible for unrest in Myanmar.

The report claims that it has found China-based threat actors continue to target entities related to China’s economic and military interests.
The company’s threat intelligence team claims to have observed targets of a China-based cyber attackers group Flx Typhoon in the Philippines, Hong Kong, India, and the United States in the early fall and winter of 2023.

Wie schlägt sich der Elektro-Koloss im Alltag,"Kia EV9 im Alltagstest: Kantiger Koloss mit Charakter
Von: Volker Pfau
Drucken Teilen
Mit über fünf Metern ist der KIA EV9 ein echter Koloss. Optisch weis das Elektroauto zu überzeugen. Bei der Reichweite bleibt er jedoch hinter den Erwartungen zurück.
Nicht nur wegen seiner Dimensionen fällt der EV9 auf, auch das Design polarisiert. Die Reaktionen der Betrachter liegen zwischen großer Begeisterung und totaler Ablehnung, wobei erstaunlicherweise die positiven Rückmeldungen überwiegen. Damit hat das Team um Kia-Chefdesigner Karim Habib alles richtig gemacht, denn wichtig ist, dass man über das Aussehen redet. Eine russische Uni hat ebenfalls ein Elektroauto entwickelt, über das man spricht – nur wird dieses als hässlichstes Elektroauto der Welt bezeichnet. Die glatten Flächen mit einfahrbaren Bügeltürgriffen und die auffällige Lackierung Ocean Blue Matt (1.800 Euro Aufpreis), in der die von uns im Alltagstest gefahrene Version GT-line Launch Edition daherkam, stechen ins Auge.
Der Kia EV9 hat vier Einzelsitze und eine Dreier-Sitzbank
Unser Exemplar war mit vier Einzelsitzen – alle davon beheiz- und klimatisierbar – und einer Dreier-Sitzbank im Heck ausgestattet. Die mittleren zwei Sitze lassen sich leicht per Hebel um 90 Grad drehen, sodass man einfach einsteigen kann und auch bequem nach ganz hinten kommt oder den kleinen Nachwuchs bequem und rückenschonend im Kindersitz festschnallen kann. Ganz hinten setzen sich wegen des dort deutlich reduzierten Raumangebots am besten nur sehr gelenkige Naturen oder Nachwuchs ohne vollen Platzbedarf. Laut Hersteller ist übrigens das gesamte Gestühl vegan.

Per Knopfdruck lassen sich die Sitze der zweiten und dritten Reihe vom Kofferraum aus umklappen. Das Gepäckraumvolumen liegt zwischen bescheidenen 333 Litern bei siebensitziger Fahrt und 2.318 Litern bei voller Nutzung des Laderaums. Zum Einladen muss aber eine 82 Zentimeter hohe Ladekante überwunden werden. Zusätzlichen Stauraum, zum Beispiel fürs Ladekabel, bietet das 52 Liter fassende Fach unter der Fronthaube. In der Version ohne Allrad fasst der Frunk sogar 90 Liter. Die Motorhaube wird zum Öffnen mit einer Teleskopstange abgestützt, was lästiges Gefummel unter der Motorhaube vermeidet. 625 Kilogramm beträgt die maximale Zuladung. Wird diese voll ausgereizt, ist man also mit einem 3,3-Tonner unterwegs.

Dank 385 PS ist der Korea-Koloss bis zu 200 km/h schnell
Der Elektromotor liefert Ur-Kräfte von 385 PS und ein Drehmoment von 700 Nm. Diese Power lässt sich problemlos bändigen, zudem ist der 1,78 Meter hohe EV9 konzeptbedingt eher als feiner Reiseschlitten denn als sportliches Vehikel ausgelegt. Trotzdem ist man im Allrad-SUV auch bei hoher Geschwindigkeit sehr stabil unterwegs, sollte sich aber stets gewahr sein, welche Masse dabei bewegt wird. Nähert man sich jedoch der Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 200 km/h, kann man in der Anzeige im Cockpit der schwindenden Reichweite zuschauen, zudem stören dann auch starke Windgeräusche.

Obwohl wir selten schneller als mit Richtgeschwindigkeit unterwegs waren, erreichten wir die von Kia angegebene Reichweite von 512 Kilometern nicht annähernd. Mit mehr als 350 Kilometern pro geladener 99,8-kWh-Akkus konnten wir nie beruhigt kalkulieren. Von dem vom Hersteller angegebenen Verbrauch von 20,2 kWh auf 100 Kilometer blieben wir weit entfernt, bei fast durchgehend moderater Fahrweise kamen wir letztlich auf einen Durchschnitt von 27,8 kWh auf 100 Kilometer. Mit ein paar Tricks kann man dank Rekuperation aber auch einige Kilometer Reichweite zusätzlich herausholen.
Stolzer Preis und luxuriöse Ausstattung
Der Grundpreis für den EV9 AWD in der GT-line-Ausstattung betragen 83.190 Euro. Dafür gibt es ein Auto mit Luxus-Ausstattung. So hat der EV9 zum Beispiel zwei Schiebedächer, für die zweite Sitzreihe ist ein großes, verschiebbares Staufach in der Mittelkonsole versteckt und im Kofferraum befindet sich eine 230-Volt-Steckdose. Nobel und benutzerfreundlich ist auch, dass sich der Deckel der Ladebuchse auf Knopfdruck schließt. Nicht ganz optimal ist dagegen, dass der Lenkstockhebel mit dem Startknopf und der Fahrprogrammwahl vom Lenkrad verdeckt wird. Es dauert geraume Zeit, bis man intuitiv draufhat, wie dies ohne Fehler zu bedienen ist. Wenig benutzerfreundlich sind auch die fummeligen Drehregler auf dem Lenkrad.

"China, North Korea targeting elections in India, US? Microsoft warns of AI use, cryptocurrency heists","China is likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content to target elections in India, the US and South Korea, and understand issues that divide voters in these countries ahead of national elections, Microsoft warned on Friday.
In a blog post, Microsoft cited its report on 'Threat Intelligence insights' to explain how China ""is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favour.""
ALSO READ: US tech giants turn to Mexico to make AI gear, spurning China
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence insights in the latest East Asia report were published by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) on Friday.
The report said it is expected that ""Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors,"" will work toward targeting elections in ""India, South Korea, and the United States"".
How China, North Korea might influence elections in India, US, South Korea?
1. China's influence operation (IO) seeks perspectives on US political topics: China had allegedly begun using generative AI to create sleek and engaging visual content. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence continued to identify AI-generated memes targeting the US, it said.
The Microsoft report claimed that China increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world. The ""increased use"" of Chinese AI-generated content in recent months aims to ""influence and sow division"" in the US and elsewhere on a range of topics. Many of this topic included controversial domestic issues.
These topics include the train derailment in Kentucky in November 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, the disposal of Japanese nuclear wastewater, drug use in the U.S. as well as immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.
The Microsoft analysis also mentioned the company's September 2023 report which highlighted how Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-affiliated social media accounts began posed as Americans across the political spectrum and responded to comments from authentic users.
2. North Korea cyber operations: The report mentioned that North Korea has increased its cryptocurrency heists and supply chain attacks to fund and further its military goals and intelligence collection.
""It has also begun to use AI to make its operations more effective and efficient,"" it added. This may facilitate the development of new military capabilities.
It added that North Korean threat actors are adapting to the age of AI. ""They are learning to use tools powered by AI large-language models (LLM) to make their operations more efficient and effective,"" the report said.
3. AI-generated contents and anchors: The Microsoft report mentions a picture in its report, claiming that it shows how Storm-1376 posted videos in Mandarin and English alleging that the United States and India were responsible for unrest in Myanmar.
""The same AI-generated anchor is used in some of these videos appeared in a Taiwan-facing Storm-1376 campaign,"" it said.
Will these tactics sway voters?
The report, however, claimed that there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion. ""While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will continue — and may prove effective down the line,"" the Microsoft report added.
China's AI influence in Taiwan election
According to the report, China did a test run in Taiwan using AI-generated content to influence voters away from a pro-sovereignty candidate.
On Taiwan’s election day, Storm-1376 had reportedly posted an AI-generated audio clips of Foxconn owner Terry Gou, an independent Party candidate in Taiwan’s presidential race, who bowed out of the contest in November 2023.
""The audio recordings portrayed Gou's voice endorsing another candidate in the presidential race. Gou’s voice in the recordings is likely AI generated, as Gou made no such statement,"" the report added.
The general or Lok Sabha Elections in India are due in April-May, while the presidential elections in the US will be held on November 5. The national elections in South Korea will be held on April 10.
Microsoft shared a timeline that showed how China used AI influence in Taiwan election.

South Korean Party Pledges Access to US Bitcoin ETFs in Race for Votes,"(Bloomberg) -- Campaigning in South Korea’s parliamentary election has underlined the nation’s status as one of the world’s largest crypto markets, with both major political parties touting related inducements to win votes.
President Yoon Suk Yeol’s People Power Party has vowed to delay a digital-asset tax, while the opposition Democratic Party pledged to lift curbs on exchange-traded funds — including US Bitcoin products — that directly hold tokens.
“We’re going to allow the ETFs, whether domestic or overseas,"" Democratic Party policy specialist Hwanseok Choi said, citing its manifesto. Hwanseok, a member of the party’s think tank, participated in drawing up the manifesto.
Yoon is seeking to wrest control of the legislature in the April 10 poll from a progressive camp led by the Democratic Party. Official figures show that more than 6 million South Koreans — over 10% of the population — participated in the crypto market via registered exchanges in the first half of last year. That represents a sizable pool of potential voters in a pivotal election.
ETF Controversy
The US in January gave the green light for ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin, and the products have amassed total assets of about $57 billion so far. South Korea’s securities regulator quickly said brokering the products locally may violate the law, effectively choking a potential efflux of speculative cash.
The move stoked some confusion and roiled a slew of stocks. The People Power Party’s manifesto doesn’t dwell on the controversy, instead promising to delay planned taxes on crypto gains beyond the scheduled timeframe of 2025.
South Koreans have been active in the latest digital-asset bull market and are famed for their ardor for smaller cryptocurrencies, not just market-leader Bitcoin. Upbit, the biggest domestic crypto exchange, regularly ranks among the top platforms globally for trading volume.
Korea Securities Depository data show South Koreans last month poured more than $200 million into the shares of US-listed Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy Inc. They also flocked to US crypto-futures ETFs, which are permitted products.
Even election candidates have exposure: some 7% own crypto, according to a Yonhap report that analyzed asset disclosures.
Crypto Risks
The flip side of such speculative animus is that crypto is a highly risky sector — the nation infamously spawned Do Kwon and his doomed Luna and TerraUSD tokens, which blew up more than $40 billion when they imploded in 2022.
But memories of the wipeout, which impacted hundreds of thousands of people, are being overshadowed by this year’s $900 billion jump in the crypto market. A dedicated investor-protection framework comes into effect in July, and both parties have indicated they would also pursue wider regulation for the industry.
Along with the sops floated by politicians, that points to the possibility of greater acceptance of digital assets in South Korea, echoing a broader Asian trend. In contrast, many US officials are hostile to crypto.
Expectations are growing that spot-crypto ETFs will eventually be allowed, adding to the potential for the crypto market to be more “widely established as an investment asset"" in South Korea, Hanwha Investment & Securities Co.’s alternative asset analyst Yumin Kim wrote in a recent note.

【新唐人快報】Temu涉廣告不實 遭韓國當局調查,"【新唐人快報】Temu涉廣告不實 遭韓國當局調查
【新唐人北京時間2024年04月09日訊】韓聯社週一（4月8日）報導，中國電商巨擘「拼多多」旗下跨境電商平台Temu因涉廣告不實和不公平商業行為，正遭到韓國公平交易委員會（Korea Fair Trade Commission，KFTC）調查。
調查旨在確認Temu是否違反消費者保護義務，以及有不實或誇大廣告。
自去年7月進軍韓國以來，Temu通過發放折價券等方式吸引會員，並且採用類似賭博的輪盤遊戲以及直銷手段而引發爭議。另外，該平台的出貨延遲和商品質量不佳等問題，也引發消費者不滿。
先前，阿里巴巴旗下的全球速賣通（AliExpress）和Temu也遭到了韓國當局的調查，有人認為韓國當局可能將調查範圍擴大到所有的中國電商平台。
韓國公平交易委員會回應說，不方便透露調查案件的具體細節，但如果發現違法行為將會嚴厲處罰。
今年稍早，Temu在法國和英國推出的一項優惠活動也廣受詬病。這項活動為下載其軟件並邀請其他人註冊的會員提供高達100歐元（110美元）的優惠券，但是，用戶必須同意的條款中，包括允許該公司終身使用其個人資料。
後來，Temu喊停了這項優惠活動，承認有「對客戶數據使用範圍的誤解」。
近年來，Shein和Temu在美國也迅速竄起。據美國海關及邊境保衛局統計表明，2023年有10億個免稅包裹進入美國，而這些包裹大部分都來自中國。
美國允許價值小於8百美元包裹免稅，而Shein、Temu以超低價進入美國市場，吸引大批美國青少年下單。
美國國土安全部表示，進口到美國的小額免稅包裹，將受到嚴格審查，包括是否違反美國強迫勞動禁令、違反海關法，以及從事其他非法行為，來削弱美國企業利益，直指中國電商在鑽美國貿易漏洞。

Filipinas lose 3-0 to South Korea in friendly,"The Philippine women’s football team couldn’t sustain its defensive stand and absorbed a 3-0 loss to South Korea in the first of two friendlies between the two nations Friday at Icheon City Stadium.
Choe Yuri, Ji Soyun and Jang Selgi all scored in the second half, leaving the Filipinas reeling after keeping things scoreless for almost a good portion of the match between last year’s participants in the Fifa Women’s World Cup.

Both teams meet again Monday at the same venue to conclude the international window.

Coach Mark Torcaso has lost all four matches this year, all against superior teams which the Filipinas want to face in a bid to gear themselves up for big events in 2025, namely the AFF Women’s Championship and the Thailand Southeast Asian Games.
It was the closest the Filipinas have ever gone to getting a positive result against South Korea, which has beaten them by convincing margins in the semifinals of the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup and last year’s Hangzhou Asian Games group stage.
A miscue by Jessika Cowart opened the door for South Korea as her weak back pass intended for goalkeeper Olivia McDaniel allowed Choe to take advantage and put the hosts on top.
Ji followed it up with a free kick to the far side of the post to double South Korea before Jang added third later in the match.
Torcaso put mostly the Filipinas veterans in his starting 11, namely McDaniel, Sarina Bolden, Hali Long, Cowart, Quinley Quezada, Tahnai Annis and Sofia Harrison.

GIST Researchers Find the Link Between Human Activity and Shifting Weather Patterns in Western North America,"GWANGJU, South Korea, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Western North America seems to be experiencing more extreme weather events more frequently. From scorching droughts to torrential floods, the climate is changing rapidly, with no signs of slowing down. From 2011 to 2015, California and neighboring states experienced extended periods of drought, while 2017 saw heavy rains trigger catastrophic floods.
These events are linked to specific weather patterns. The atmosphere is like a network of interconnected pathways that determine how weather systems move and interact across the globe. In the Northern Hemisphere, there are three such major teleconnection patterns that affect winter conditions: the Pacific North American pattern (PNA), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the North American winter dipole (NAWD). However, the understanding of how these patterns change over time and their connection to climate change remains limited.
To better understand this phenomenon, a group of scientists led by Professor of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering Jin-Ho Yoon and including Ph.D. student Jueun Lee from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology recently conducted a study to examine the reasons behind changes in these patterns. Their findings have been published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science on 7 March 2024.
The scientists employed a sophisticated Community Earth System model that there is a regular influence of the NAWD for over 70 years (1951-2020), which is in contrast with the fluctuating influence from PNA and minor impacts from NAO. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a strengthening negative correlation between the PNA and the NAWD: as one exhibits a positive phase, the other tends to exhibit a negative phase. “This projected intensification of large-scale atmospheric circulation in a warming climate is expected to likely escalate extreme hydroclimatic events in mid-latitude regions like California near western North America,” explains Dr. Yoon.
The weather system is like a network of dominos, where one piece can trigger a chain reaction and set off a series of unforeseen events. Using extensive models and numerical simulations, the scientists deduced that these changes in how the PNA and the NAWD interact can be traced back to variations in the jet stream, a band-like flow of air high up in the atmosphere. As the climate warms, the jet stream changes, influencing patterns such as the PNA and the NAWD.
The study notably shows that greenhouse gas emissions play a significant role in driving the shifts. “Climate models consider a range of factors affecting the atmosphere, including changes in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities. By running simulations with and without the influence of greenhouse gases, we can compare the results and see how they differ,” explains Dr. Yoon. The scientists observed an association between higher greenhouse gas levels and the variations in the jet stream: the gases drive the northward drift of the Asia-Pacific jet core. Aided by mountain-related lifting over the Alaskan Range, contributing to the formation of potent high-pressure systems in the vicinity. This phenomenon strengthens the winter stationary wave throughout western North America.
Simply put, the study shows that the rise in temperatures caused by greenhouse gases is changing how air moves in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects the weather patterns that influence winter conditions in western North America and contribute to recent more frequent extreme weather events.

"China plans to disrupt US elections using AI-generated content, Microsoft claims","wildpixel/Getty Images
The Chinese government is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts to disrupt elections around the world, Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Team has warned. Microsoft claims that a host of Chinese state-backed cyber criminal groups are planning to use AI to interfere with elections in 2024 in the US, India, and South Korea. The company's security experts added that North Korea is also participating in the effort, which could span a variety of channels, including social media.
""China is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favor,"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""China has also increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world.""
Also: How AI will fool voters in 2024 if we don't do something now
Microsoft added that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backs cybercriminal groups that, in recent months, have tried to divide Americans on a variety of recent events, including claiming that the US government may have been involved in the Kentucky train derailment in November 2023, that the US is intentionally poisoning foreign water supplies, the reasons for drug use in the US, as well as ""immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.""
At the same time, Microsoft, which has monitored the group's communications across channels, said that ""there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion.""
Governments across the globe have always used technology extensively to influence public opinion, and especially in the past decade. Soon after the 2016 US election, several reports suggested the Russian government was actively attempting to spread misinformation to sway US public opinion. Other reports have suggested that China, the US, and many other countries have similarly engaged in cyber techniques that aim to convince people around the globe to side with their initiatives.
However, as AI becomes more sophisticated, the risks of spreading misinformation only grow. With the ability to create fake images, videos, and other types of content, it's possible for governments and government-backed cyber criminal groups to target many more people with far more believable content.
According to Microsoft, North Korea's involvement in the efforts center not necessarily on swaying elections, but on generating revenue for the country. North Korea already engages in stealing cryptocurrency funds and attacking supply chain software.
""The United Nations estimates that North Korean cyber actors have stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency since 2017,"" Microsoft said. ""Heists totaling between $600 million and $1 billion occurred in 2023 alone.""
Also: Tech giants promise to combat fraudulent AI content in mega elections year
Looking ahead, Microsoft said that based on China's activities so far, the chances of the country impacting global elections remains low. However, that doesn't mean this couldn't change in the future.
""We assess that China will, at a minimum, create and amplify AI-generated content to benefit its interests,"" Microsoft said. ""Despite the chances of such content in affecting election results remaining low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will likely continue – and may prove more effective down the line.""",2024-04-05T13:29:00Z,https://www.zdnet.com,ZDNet

Early voting kicks off with heavy turnout in South Korea elections,"1 of 5 | Early voting began on Friday for next week's National Assembly election in South Korea, a contest widely seen as a referendum on the administration of current President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photo by Thomas Maresca/UPI
SEOUL, April 5 (UPI) -- South Korean voters turned out in record-setting numbers for early voting Friday ahead of next week's parliamentary elections, which are widely seen as a midterm referendum on the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Voters began casting ballots at 3,565 polling stations nationwide in a two-day early voting period before the main vote on Wednesday for the 300-member National Assembly. Advertisement
When the polls closed at 6 p.m., some 6.91 million people, or 15.61% of eligible voters, had cast a ballot, according to the National Election Commission. It was the highest figure ever in early voting for a general election and well above the 12.04% turnout at the same time four years ago.
Yoon's People Power Party is aiming to take the majority in the National Assembly, which is currently dominated by the opposition Democratic Party.
In 2022, the conservative Yoon narrowly edged out his opponent Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party by a razor-thin margin. A Democratic Party-led bloc has held 180 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly since 2020, however, severely hampering Yoon's domestic agenda.
Advertisement
A poll released last week by Gallup Korea showed the PPP with greater support than the Democratic Party, at 37% to 29%. But Yoon's party would need to flip more than 30 seats to take control of the parliament, widely considered a tall order.
That task is made more difficult as Yoon has been saddled with low approval ratings over his handling of a wide range of issues from sky-high housing prices and soaring food costs to concerns over the country's plunging birth rate, which is the lowest in the world.
Last week's Gallup Korea poll saw his support drop from a recent high of 39% to 34% ahead of the election.
Yoon has also been at the center of a standoff with striking trainee doctors that has dragged on since February, while his administration has been beset by corruption allegations, including a highly publicized scandal around First Lady Kim Keon Hee accepting the gift of a Dior bag.
Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is facing corruption challenges of his own and is currently facing trials over a range of charges including bribery.
Next week's result will play a large role in Yoon's ability to press ahead with his agenda over the remaining three years of his mandatory single five-year term.
Advertisement
On the domestic front, Yoon has long been aiming to push through economic reforms that include taking on labor unions and reducing regulations on businesses. He has had more success establishing his agenda on the foreign policy front, where Seoul has taken a harder line against North Korea and strengthened security cooperation with the United States and Japan.
Yoon cast his vote early Friday morning in Busan while on an official visit to the city.
Lee also voted early in the central city of Daejeon.
""In the end, it's up to the people to decide, and I would like to ask you to vote early today and tomorrow,"" Lee said. ""If you give up your sovereignty, if you give up your vote, all that you give up goes to a few vested interests.""
While South Korea's political landscape is dominated by the two main parties, a wild card this year is the rise of third parties in recent polls. The progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, led by disgraced former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, has emerged as the third most popular party and is drawing voters disillusioned with the status quo.
In the last Gallup Korea poll, the party -- which was only formed in February -- had 12% support, highlighting the possibility of gaining enough seats to play a spoiler role in the tightly contested parliament.

The Japanese leader speaks ahead of a planned summit next week with US President Joe Biden, as the allies look for ways to counter China's growing influence in Asia
TOKYO, Japan – Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday, April 5, said he wanted to cooperate with South Korea and the Philippines, allies shared with the US, and even engage with North Korea to promote regional security.
“The current security environment is tough and complex, and we are at a turning point in history,” Kishida said in a group interview. “Cooperation between Japan and the United States and like-minded countries is a very important issue,” he added.
The Japanese leader spoke ahead of a planned summit next week with US President Joe Biden, as the allies look for ways to counter China’s growing influence in Asia and deter it from resorting to military action to resolve its disputes in the region.
The state visit to Washington, the first by a Japanese leader in nine years, is meant to showcase their close security and economic ties, with the two leaders expected to discuss cooperation on defense equipment and a possible upgrade in the US military command structure in Japan.
That meeting will be followed by a trilateral summit with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
“Close cooperation between Japan, the US, and the Philippines is crucial for a free and open order based on the rule of law and for economic prosperity in the region,” Kishida said.
Japan last year delivered four air defense radars to the Philippines and is negotiating a reciprocal access agreement with Manila that would make it easier for Japanese troops to train there.
A separate trilateral meeting between Kishida, Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in the US last year helped Tokyo mend relations with Seoul and bolster security cooperation.
Kishida has said he is also willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim “without any preconditions” in a bid to improve strained relations with the nuclear-armed regime.
Relations between the countries have been strained over disputes dating back to Japan’s occupation in the first half of the 20th century, and by North Korea’s past abduction of Japanese citizens.
“Establishing a fruitful relationship will not only benefit Japan and North Korea but will also contribute greatly to peace and stability in the region,” Kishida said.

She slept with a violin on her pillow in Korea. Her dreams came true in Italy,"CREMONA – When Ms Ayoung An was 8, her parents bought her a violin. She slept with the instrument on the pillow next to her every night.
Two years later, a shop selling musical instruments opened in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, her home town, and Ms An became a fixture there, pelting the owner with questions. “I think I bothered him a lot,” Ms An, now 32, said.
As a teenager, she decided she would become a violin-maker.
Eventually, a journey with twists and turns took her to Cremona in northern Italy – a famed hub for violin-makers, including masters like Antonio Stradivari, since the 16th century. There, Ms An, a rising star in the violin-making world with international awards under her belt, runs her own workshop.
Set on a quiet cobblestone street, Ms An’s studio is bathed in natural light and filled with books and piles of wood chunks that must air dry for five to 10 years before becoming instruments or risk warping. She shares the two-room studio with her husband, Mr Han Wangsoo, who’s also a violin-maker.
On a recent Monday, Ms An was hunched over a thick 20-inch piece of wood held in place by two metal clamps. Pressing her body down for leverage, she scraped the wood with a gouge, removing layers, her hands steady and firm. She was forming a curving neck called a “scroll”, one of the later steps of making a violin or cello. On this day, the violin-maker was immersed on a commission for a cello, which shares a similar crafting process.
Violins like Ms An’s, made in the tradition of Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri, require about two months of work and sell for about €16,000 (S$23,400) to €17,000.
“I can make a violin in three weeks, but I don’t want to,” Ms An said. “This object is very precious to the person purchasing it.”
Ms An was 17 when she hatched her plan to learn the craft: She would move in with an American family in a Chicago suburb so that she could attend a local high school, master English and eventually study at the Chicago School of Violin Making. There were no such schools in Korea at the time.
Her parents, distraught about her moving so far away to pursue an uncertain career path, tried to stop her.
“I didn’t eat for days,” Ms An said. Finally, they gave in. “When I said goodbye to my parents at the airport, they were crying,” she added. “I wasn’t. I was too excited.”
Two years after moving to Illinois, she discovered that one of the best-known schools for violin-makers, the International School of Violin Making, was actually in Cremona. So in 2011, at age 20, she moved to a new country again.",2024-04-05T05:35:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
"South Korea election issues: Green onions, striking doctors, an alleged sexist jab at a candidate","People pass by posters of candidates running for the upcoming parliamentary election in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, April 3, 2024. As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues. This represents a stark contrast from past elections, which were overshadowed by security and foreign policy issues like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)
SEOUL – Soaring prices for green onions and apples. Striking doctors. A politician's allegedly sexist jab at a female candidate. These are among the issues animating voters in South Korea this year.
As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues, staying away from traditionally popular agendas like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.
Recommended Videos
“I feel drawn to someone who talks about things that can be truly helpful to our neighborhoods,” said Kim Yun-ah, a 45-year-old Seoul officer worker. “I often don’t know when North Korea test-fired missiles.”
Experts say up to about 30% or 40% of South Korea’s 44 million voters are politically neutral and that who they end up supporting will likely determine the results of the April 10 elections.
A look at the upcoming South Korean elections and the issues affecting voters’ sentiments.
MODERATES
South Korea’s conservative-liberal divide is so stark that many voters likely have already determined who they'll vote for according to their party affiliation, rather than by looking at the policies of the candidates in their districts.
But the extreme polarization has led to an expansion of moderates who are fed up with partisan strife and who focus more on livelihoods issues such as prices, jobs and taxes, according to Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.
Choi estimated that roughly 30% of South Koreas are conservatives, another 30% liberals and the remaining 40% moderates. Other experts put the proportion of moderates at 30%.
“In a nutshell, even if conservatives and liberals intensely bicker over political issues, that won’t influence election results much,” Choi said. “The fate of an election is rather determined by the moderates who silently monitor livelihood issues and decide who to vote for.”
Some observers say liberal opposition parties could retain their majority status, making conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol — whose single five-year term ends in 2027 — an early lame duck. But others note many moderates are still undecided, so it’s too early to predict who would win.
Regardless of the electoral outcome, Yoon's major foreign policy agendas would remain unchanged, such as boosting security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan and taking a tough line on North Korea's nuclear program, experts say.
GREEN ONIONS
Yoon got more than he bargained for when he visited a Seoul grocery mall last month to promote government efforts to tame food prices but ended up inviting criticism by talking about the prices of green onions.
Looking at a bundle of green onions with a price tag of 875 won ($0.65) — a temporary discount price offered thanks to a government subsidy — Yoon said that “I’ve been to lots of markets, and I would say 875 won is a reasonable price.”
Meanwhile, the average retail prices of green onions has hovered around 3,000 to 4,000 won ($2.2 to 2.9) in past weeks, reaching some of the highest levels in recent years.
Yoon's throw-away comment has created a mini-crisis for his ruling People Power Party as candidates from the main liberal opposition Democratic Party have brought green onions to election rallies and accused Yoon of underestimating food prices and being out of touch of the reality.
It’s not just green onions. The prices of agricultural products during March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The prices of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.
Kim Tae-hyung, a 55-year-old moderate liberal, said he's almost decided to vote for a liberal opposition candidate running in his constituency because he believes the Yoon government hasn't done well on economy issues.
But he said Yoon doesn't deserve criticism over his green onion remarks. “Even if he doesn't know the price of green onions, I don't think it matters much as I also didn't know about it,"" Kim said.
STRIKING DOCTORS
The weekslong strikes by thousands of doctors is another headache for Yoon's party.
The doctors, all medical interns and residents, are protesting against Yoon's push to increase the yearly medical school admission cap by two thirds to create more doctors. They say universities can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that would undermine the country's future medical services, though critics say they simply worry about lower income in the wake of the supply of more doctors.
South Korea has one of the world's fastest-aging populations and its doctors-to-population ratio is among the lowest in the developed world. But efforts to add seats at medical schools is a politically risky project that past governments had already failed to achieve because of similar vehement protests by incumbent doctors and medical students.
Yoon initially enjoyed a rising approval rating over his recruitment plan, but now faces growing calls for a compromise as the doctors' strikes have caused numerous cancelled surgeries at hospitals and other inconveniences for patients.
“We absolutely need to raise the medical school quota. But the government is pushing for its increase in a too steep, abrupt manner that has surprised everyone,” said Lee Chul-seung, a liberal Seoul citizen in his mid-50s.
TOXIC RHETORIC
Fueled by contempt for the other side, the rival parties have spewed highly offensive, abusive language against each other.
When Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party chairman, criticized senior ruling party candidate Na Kyung-won over her alleged pro-Japanese views, he called her “nabe,” a combination of parts of the names of Na and late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon quickly called Lee's comments ""extreme misogyny."" Nabe in Japanese means pot, whose Korean translation is “naembi"" that can be used as a derogatory slang term to refer to a woman with many sex partners. Last month, supporters of Na's liberal rival candidate reportedly spread on social media a poster with a message saying “naembi tastes best when it's trampled on.""
Han labelled Lee's past comments as “trash,” drawing rebukes from Lee's party spokesperson who described “Han's mouth” “as ”trash bin.""
Also roiling the South Korean election race is former liberal justice minister Cho Kuk, whose newly launched small party is forecast by surveys to win 10-15 seats. Cho was once a rising political star during the government of Yoon's liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, until he faced a slew of scandals that hurt his reformist image and sharply split the nation.

The US tech firm said it expected Chinese state-backed cyber groups to target high-profile elections in 2024, with North Korea also involved, according to a report by the company’s threat intelligence team published on Friday.
“As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections,” the report reads.
Microsoft said that “at a minimum” China will create and distribute through social media AI-generated content that “benefits their positions in these high-profile elections”.
The company added that the impact of AI-made content was minor but warned that could change.
“While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft.
Microsoft said in the report that China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January. The company said this was the first time it had seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election.
A Beijing-backed group called Storm 1376, also known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, was highly active during the Taiwanese election. Its attempts to influence the election included posting fake audio on YouTube of the election candidate Terry Gou – who had bowed out in November – endorsing another candidate. Microsoft said the clip was “likely AI generated”. YouTube removed the content before it reached many users.
The Beijing-backed group pushed a series of AI-generated memes about the ultimately successful candidate, William Lai – a pro-sovereignty candidate opposed by Beijing – that levelled baseless claims against Lai accusing him of embezzling state funds. There was also an increased use of AI-generated TV news anchors, a tactic that has also been used by Iran, with the “anchor” making unsubstantiated claims about Lai’s private life including fathering illegitimate children.
Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut tool, which is developed by Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok.
Microsoft added that Chinese groups continue to mount influence campaigns in the US. It said Beijing-backed actors are using social media accounts to pose “divisive questions” and attempt to understand issues dividing US voters.
“This could be to gather intelligence and precision on key voting demographics ahead of the US Presidential election,” said Microsoft in a blog post accompanying the report.
One post on X, formerly Twitter, referred to a $118bn bipartisan bill in the US that combined a $20bn of investment in the US-Mexico border with a $75bn package for Ukraine and Israel. It asked: “What’s your reaction?” Another flagged the loss of an F-35 fighter in South Carolina last year, saying “only under the Biden administration” could a valuable piece of military hardware be lost – although debris was found soon after – and asked “what do you think about this?”
The report was published in the same week that a White House-appointed official review board said “a cascade of errors” by Microsoft let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior US officials. Last month, the US and UK governments accused China-backed hackers of waging a years-long cyber campaign targeting politicians, journalists and businesses, as well as the UK’s election watchdog.",2024-04-05T04:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Naver CEO to fight against U.S. Big Tech in AI arms race,"Internet firm Naver has earned its nickname—Korea’s Google—by pulling off an improbable feat: It dominates South Korea’s search market, having defended its turf from Google, the world’s top search engine, whose revenue is 40 times as large as Naver’s.
As of September 2023, Naver controlled 59% of Korea’s search market to Google’s 31%.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon,” says Choi Soo-yeon, Naver’s CEO since 2022.
Naver is hardly a household name outside Korea. But it operates a sprawling portfolio that pits the $22-billion-in-market-cap firm against other Big Tech giants on multiple fronts.
It has a controlling stake in both Yahoo Japan—the most popular website in Japan, according to Nielsen—and the Japanese messaging app Line—a WhatsApp rival—through a joint venture with SoftBank.
It runs Korea’s No. 2 e-commerce service, behind Coupang. (Amazon’s platform ranks fourth.) Naver’s $1.2 billion purchase last year of Poshmark, the U.S.-based clothing-resale site, expanded its retail reach.
In the streaming wars era, Naver has amassed content platforms of its own. It owns Webtoon, which hosts mobile-friendly comic strips that are popular across Asia. (Naver is reportedly planning a U.S. IPO for Webtoon later this year.) Naver bought Wattpad, a Canada-based platform for user-submitted fiction, for $600 million in 2021.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon.” Choi Soo-yeon, Naver CEO
Naver also has a small but growing cloud-computing business—a category in which Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reign supreme—and it’s launched a series of AI projects to contend with the release of OpenAI’s viral chatbot, ChatGPT.
In recent quarters, Naver’s many business lines have notched record revenues and operating profits, but Choi sees Naver’s mission as extending beyond its own bottom line.
Despite Naver’s small size, she casts the firm as a counterpoint in a global tech scene in which power is concentrated among a gargantuan few.
“It’s becoming a world where there are only one or two search companies and one or two commerce companies,” Choi said in a recent wide-ranging interview—her first with the international press—at Naver headquarters in Seongnam, just outside Seoul. (Choi gave her answers in Korean, which were later translated into English.) Naver “is a company that constantly fights against such a world and strives to preserve diversity,” she says.
Investors question whether Naver can go toe-to-toe with cash-rich rivals. Still, Choi’s goal is ambitious—perhaps even noble—and belies the role she was appointed to fill: that of a caretaker CEO brought on to steady a company in turmoil.
Choi, 42, was an unconventional pick to run the company. A Harvard-educated M&A lawyer, she joined Naver in 2019 as head of global business support to help lead the firm’s expansion. Three years later, the board named Choi as CEO to show it was prepared to overhaul its culture after a series of crises.
In May 2021, a senior Naver developer died by suicide after accusing the company of fostering a toxic work culture. A labor union probe found he’d been bullied by executives for years. A later government survey found that over half of employees felt they were bullied at least once in a six-month period.
In the aftermath, Naver said “there were some acts of workplace harassment by some executives.” Choi’s predecessor as CEO, Han Seong-sook, stepped down, as did Naver’s COO, and Naver tapped Choi. At the time, she told shareholders her most urgent task was “to recover Naver’s corporate culture based on trust and autonomy.”
But a second tragedy struck early in Choi’s tenure. In September 2022, another employee died by suicide while on maternity leave, local media reported. Months later, her family claimed she’d been mistreated at work. A Naver internal investigation did not uncover evidence of harassment, and Korea’s labor ministry could not confirm the family’s claims, a company spokesperson said.
South Korea has the highest rate of suicide of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and South Koreans work 200 hours more per year than the global average.
“There was a lack of trust in the systems, leadership, and board,” Choi says of Naver’s previous culture. One big change Choi made was to reintroduce remote work, a rarity in post-COVID South Korea. The option gives employees “the choice of what kind of working environment they can be most productive and create the most innovation in.”
The suicides were the biggest scandal to rock Naver in its 25-year history. Naver launched in 1999, when founder Lee Hae-jin turned an internal Samsung project into an independent company. By the mid-2000s, Naver had passed rivals like web portal Daum to dominate Korea’s search market.
Naver and fellow internet firm Kakao (founded by an ex-Naver executive) have made South Korea one of a handful of countries where homegrown search engines outperform U.S. search giants without government intervention.
Naver got a head start on tailoring a search engine that met the tastes of the South Korean market, says Bokyung Suh, a Korea analyst at Bernstein Research. Naver hooked users early with its busy homepage that was heavy on icons, links, and animations. Google launched a bare-bones search engine in Korean in 2000, but it didn’t catch on. Google updated its site to a feature-rich format six years later.
Naver earned 9.6 trillion won ($7.41 billion) in revenue in 2023, a record. Search and e-commerce generated 37% and 26% of sales, respectively. It made $1.3 billion in operating profit, also a record.
Yet shares are currently trading about 60% below a COVID-era high. Investors are concerned about slowing revenue from search (up 0.6% in 2023), plummeting revenue from display ads (down 10% last year), and the lack of a “punchy, clear growth strategy,” Suh says.
Naver’s lack of a punchy, clear growth strategy is especially worrisome in the AI age, when Naver faces U.S. companies that are investing billions in the technology.
As U.S. giants dominate English-based AI, Naver may be able to establish an edge in systems based in Korean and other languages, Choi says.
Naver has a chatbot, CLOVA X, and an AI-powered search engine, Cue. Both are built on its Korean-language large-language model, HyperCLOVA X, which outperforms OpenAI’s GPT in Korean, recent studies say. Naver has claimed that HyperCLOVA, an earlier version of its model, was trained on 6,500 times as much Korean data as GPT-3.0, which underpins OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Naver is also partnering with Saudi Aramco on an Arabic large-language model.
Choi is especially interested in what she calls “sovereign AI,” or a model that’s tailored to an individual user. “We focus on what companies and governments that want to use AI would want, and what needs Big Tech can’t fulfill,” she says. As AI becomes more common, “each group will need an AI model that best understands” its unique traits.

Much like her rivals at Google and Microsoft, Choi is also grappling with how to integrate AI—with its penchant to hallucinate false information—into Naver’s search product. “People need accurate information through search,” she says, though she hopes AI’s tendency to make stuff up will become “nearly negligible in the near future.”
At the same time, she also sees room for a traditional search engine—with its list of links to choose from—amid the generative AI revolution. “Not all questions in the world have a single correct answer,” she says. “There is still a need for exploration.”
Naver’s base in South Korea, a chip powerhouse, is an advantage in the AI race, especially its homegrown manufacturers “that support the Korean language,” Choi says. Naver’s chip partners include Korea’s Samsung and the U.S.’s Intel.
“It’s not healthy to rely on just one company,” Choi says. Is that a coded reference to Nvidia? Yes, she says in English, with a smile.
Just four of South Korea’s top 100 firms by revenue had women CEOs last year, according to global headhunter UnicoSearch. Just 6% of executives at the companies were women.
Choi, whose CEO contract expires in 2025, expresses some unease at often being a “sole woman” in business: “Simply because I am a woman, there are expectations for me to demonstrate skills such as effective communication, adept conflict resolution, and the ability to nurture people.”
Korea’s internet sector got a little more diverse when Kakao appointed its first female CEO, Shina Chung, in March.
“I’m not alone anymore!” Choi says.

I'm adopted and wasn't interested in exploring my South Korean heritage. That changed in 2020,"Everyone in my life knows me as Luke, but for the first six months of my life I was Choi, Jeong Hyuk.
My adoption records state that my name means Truth and Glory.
Earlier this year I travelled to South Korea, where I was born, for the first time as an adult.
During my first few days in Seoul and then Daegu, the city of my birth, a sense of home would hit me in waves, affecting all of my senses. It was the taste of the food, the colour palette of winter — even the smell of open sewer vents early in the morning was strangely comforting.
I experienced it while sitting on the subway too, which was unexpected and moving, because I haven't had a sense of home for a long time.
In addition to growing up as a South Korean adoptee in Australia in the 1980s and 90s, my childhood home in lutruwita/Tasmania was completely destroyed by fire in 2005.
A sense of ""home"" that affected all of my senses hit me in waves over the course of my first week in Seoul. ( )
By my second week in Korea, this feeling of home was constant. I mentioned this to someone I met in a museum and their response was one of the most profound parts of the trip.
""Of course,"" I remember them saying. ""Everything in this country has been designed for you by people like you"".
A long journey home that started in lockdown
Luke Bowden in Daegu, the South Korean city where he was born. ( )
I grew up with little to no interest in connecting with my South Korean heritage, instead wanting as much as possible to be 'Australian'.
Something changed in 2020 and I became curious about my birth family and past. I decided to reach out to a high-school friend, who is also an adoptee from South Korea, and asked for her advice on how I might find out more.
The search for my biological parents took years and involved DNA databases and petitions from the Tasmanian government to the adoption agency in Seoul on my behalf.
In mid-2022, the agency contacted my biological mother, who is now married. She denied being pregnant or having a baby and requested no further contact.
South Korea is quite conservative in comparison to Australia, and the assumption is her now-husband would be unaware she had a child before meeting him. Therefore, her only course of action would be denial.
I remember the day the woman from the Tasmanian government called with this news. I was at work and she asked if there was somewhere quiet I could go.
Unconsciously, I asked if it was good news, and quickly learnt it was the opposite.
I was acutely upset about my birth mother's response, with rejection and abandonment being such an inherent trigger.
When I mentioned this to a mental health professional weeks later, she shared something I initially dismissed.
""You've got closure on this now, Luke,"" she said.
""You've found the mother and now you can go and forge your own identity"".
Following my own footsteps
The adoption agency is the only place in Seoul is the only place in South Korea I knew I had been to before. ( )
Towards the end of my trip to Korea, I visited the adoption agency where my adoptive parents collected me in 1985.
As the elevator opened on the fourth floor I was greeted by two toddlers running around my legs.
A staff member gave me a tour of the building, explaining how much has changed within the building, with only the foyer remaining in its original state.
As we chatted at the building's entrance I couldn't take my eyes off the steps, consumed by the thought of my adoptive parents walking down them and onto the streets of Seoul with me in their arms.
With little information about my life before coming to Australia, the adoption agency is the only place in South Korea that I know I've been before.
My trip was coming to an end and the same friend who helped me begin the search for my family, organised a meeting with Professor Lee, Keun-Su, a former police officer who now locates missing people and works to reunite families.
With the assistance of a translator, Professor Lee said he might be able to find more information about my biological parents.
After our brief meeting, I was preparing to start my long journey home when Professor Lee invited me to join him on a radio show where he was due to do an interview.
It was last minute but I work in the media, so agreed. I was also purposefully being very spontaneous on this trip.
A message for my biological parents
The radio host and Professor Lee explained that they would ask me to introduce myself and explain what I was doing in South Korea. After this, they continued the program in Korean as I sat silently in the studio.
While I don't understand or speak Korean, I do know my biological parents' names, so it was a surprise to hear Professor Lee say their names and the province my records say they come from.
I realised he was doing a national call-out live on air for my birth parents.
Before I made this trip, many people asked if I was going to be looking for my family. It was never on my agenda because I already had closure.
It wasn't until the end of my time in Korea that I realised what the whole trip had been about: I was following Choi, Jeong Hyuk's footsteps — my own.
Back in the radio studio, Professor Lee pushed his phone towards my microphone, using a translation app to ask, ""what would you like to say to your parents?""
""I would like to tell them I have had a good life in Australia and to thank them very much for letting me be adopted. That I am well. That I am healthy and that I understand.""

Corporate Reforms at Risk From Opposition Win in Korea Election,"(Bloomberg) -- South Koreans head to the polls next week to elect a new parliament and the outcome may threaten the government’s Japan-like corporate reforms that have helped spur a stock market rally.
The results of the April 10 vote to select the 300 members of the National Assembly could undermine President Yoon Suk Yeol’s flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the “Corporate Value-Up"" program, along with a number of his other reform measures.
Stocks and the won have already started to retreat in recent weeks amid concern the left-wing opposition will score a major victory over Yoon’s ruling party. An opposition victory already appears the most likely outcome. The odds of the ruling party gaining a majority in the vote is just 20%, according to economists at Citibank Korea.
“I plan to wait and see the results of the elections"" before buying, said Jae Lee, chief investment officer at Timefolio Asset Management SG Pvt in Singapore. “It’s not too late to pick stocks after confirming that the government and the regulators show strong commitment to the reform"" following the election, he said.
President Yoon, who took office in 2022, is aiming to replicate Japan’s success with corporate reforms that have propelled its stocks to record highs. His plan is to offer tax incentives to encourage listed firms to improve their valuations, a measure that requires parliamentary approval. The Value-Up program has already helped lure record quarterly foreign inflows to Korean stocks, which have also supported the won.
Here are some areas traders will be watching as the election takes place:
1. ‘Value-up’ and Tax Cuts
A key plank of the Value-Up program is to provide tax incentives for those firms that put in place measures to enhance shareholder returns. Levies that may be cut include dividend income tax, corporate tax, and inheritance tax.
That agenda may face increasing resistance if the opposition wins big.
“A left-wing dominant National Assembly could be less cooperative on tax incentives"" for the Value-Up program as they are likely to be deemed as a tax cut for the wealthy, Citibank economists including Jinwook Kim in Seoul wrote in an April 1 report.
Without the tax incentives, the Corporate Value-Up program would lack much of the driving force that is necessary to make it successful, Bank of America economists wrote in a research note last week.
2. Fate of the Capital Gains Tax
Another of Yoon’s policies that may be imperiled in the election is the president’s desire to abolish the planned capital gains tax on income from financial investments.
Yoon in January pledged to scrap the planned tax — which is set to be introduced next year — in a bid to boost investor sentiment and stock values.
The government had earlier agreed to delay the planned tax by two years from its original 2023 implementation date. The proposal would impose a levy of at least 20% on income from investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds if annual capital gains from them exceeds 50 million won ($37,000).
The main opposition Democratic Party wants to push ahead and introduce the tax.
3. Currency Market Reforms
Yoon’s government is also seeking to extend trading hours for the onshore won as part of efforts to improve investors’ access to the local market — a move that could help get Korean bonds and stocks included in more global indexes and thereby encourage greater foreign inflows.
Pilot tests are being conducted ahead of the official extension of the won’s trading hours slated for July.
Some analysts say one of the key things to watch for after the election will be how the new parliament perceives these reforms.
“For me and the market, the most important thing is the government’s resolve to push forward with the market reforms and FX liberalization,"" said Wee Khoon Chong, senior Asia Pacific market strategist at BNY Mellon in Hong Kong.
4. Buy Election Volatility
The uncertainty surrounding the election is expected to increase volatility, but it may also provide a buying opportunity, some investors say.
A decisive left-wing victory may see a pullback in stocks, especially those that have seen big gains on expectations for the “Value-up"" program.
If stocks fall, there are a “large number of investors with the belief that the Value-Up program will continue, with or without legislative support, and willing to buy into weakness,"" Bank of America analysts including Joon-Ho Lee and Jeehoon Park wrote in an April 1 research report.
Peter Kim of KB Securities Co. agrees.
An election win by the opposition should not scare away investors or change the long-term direction that the Korean government is trying to take, said Kim, Seoul-based head of global markets at KB.
Possible weakness in the won after the election may also be seen as a buying opportunity.
Any election shock is likely to be short-lived, BNY Mellon’s Chong said. “I like the won the most"" out of all emerging Asian currencies in the second quarter as it’s expected to be supported by “strong foreign inflows and tech export recovery,"" he said.
South Korea’s stock market will be shut April 10 for the election, and resume trading the following day. There has not been any announcement yet on any close for the currency market.

"How a Violin Maker’s Dreams Came True in Cremona, Italy","Art of Craft is a series about craftspeople whose work rises to the level of art.
When Ayoung An was 8, her parents bought her a violin. She slept with the instrument on the pillow next to her every night.

"Hualien, Taiwan earthquake: Toll on Taiwan’s chip industry","When a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan’s eastern coast on April 3, the first concern involved the risk to people and property. Here, the news was not as dire as initially feared — only nine people have been reported killed as of Wednesday evening, along with hundreds of injuries. Considering that Wednesday’s quake was the strongest in Taiwan in 25 years — and that earthquakes of similar strength have killed tens of thousands of people or more in other countries — this could have been much worse.
Taiwan was largely able to withstand such a powerful quake because the island has taken earthquake preparation seriously, strengthening its building codes after past disasters and drilling its population in how to respond. The newest buildings tended to fare best — the 1,670-foot Taipei 101, the island’s tallest building and designed to dampen shaking in a quake, barely moved.
There was one other way in which Taiwan — and the world — avoided a worse outcome from the earthquake: the island’s all-important semiconductor manufacturing industry seemed to emerge largely intact. That’s good news — but it’s also a reminder of how fragile some of the most important nodes of the global economy remain.
The world’s computers can’t run without Taiwan
To say that Taiwan is important to the global tech industry is like saying oxygen is important to breathing. Taiwan as a whole is responsible for making 80 to 90 percent of the world’s most advanced computer chips — ones for which there is no current substitute. Taiwan’s TSMC makes up half of that production on its own, and 90 percent of the chips TSMC makes are produced in its 12 fabrication plants — or “fabs” — on the island.
Fortunately, all of those fabs are on the western side of the island, away from the epicenter of the April 3 quake. Even a slight vibration, though, is enough to throw off the highly sensitive work of semiconductor manufacturing, and some machinery was halted or even damaged. But TSMC reported that production was getting back to normal within a few hours of the quake.
Again, preparation made a difference — TSMC has invested heavily in earthquake resilience in its fabs, which the company says are designed well beyond code.
But part of the reason that Taiwan has made itself so resilient to earthquakes is that it has a long history of … earthquakes. The island sits on the Ring of Fire, which is the unusually cool name for the 25,000-mile long belt of volcanoes and earthquakes that surround the Pacific Ocean. As a result, Taiwan experiences around a thousand earthquakes per year that are strong enough to be felt, and many more that aren’t. And just last year Taipei discovered an actual active volcano within its city limits.
After a 1999 earthquake that did more damage to Taiwan’s chip-building infrastructure, the electronics industry was disrupted for weeks — and that was at a time when tech and computer chips were far less important to the global economy than they are today, when chips are found in everything from cars to refrigerators. A Credit Suisse analysis found that if TSMC’s operations were to be somehow shut down — perhaps by an even more massive quake — manufacturing across the global economy would be severely disrupted.
And, of course, earthquakes and volcanoes are just one threat to Taiwan’s semiconductor foundries. The better known one is just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s Republic of China has made it increasingly clear that it could be willing to use military power to force reunification with what it regards as a renegade province. Should Taiwan’s chip foundries be destroyed in such a conflict, the damage to the global economy could be on par with the Great Depression.
The fragile points of global tech
Is it the safest thing in the world to concentrate production of perhaps the single most important manufactured component of the global economy on one island that faces existential threats of both the seismic and geopolitical varieties (plus the occasional typhoon)? Not really.
But Taiwan is hardly the only critical node in tech manufacturing that happens to be located in a risky part of the world.
South Korea is maybe the second-most important location for semiconductor fabrication after Taiwan, with a 60 percent market share of the memory chips used in PCs and smartphones, and is the home of the major global tech player Samsung. South Korea also abuts North Korea, a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator who appears to be increasingly flirting with the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. It’s also at risk from storms and flooding, though at least its tectonics are fairly stable. (Maybe?)
How about Japan? It’s no longer the dominant player it was in the go-go 1980s, though the government has spent billions to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the country, and it now has about 10 percent of the global market. Japan is also one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth — it’s at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and typhoons. And should a war with either North Korea or with China over Taiwan come to pass, Japan will surely be on the front line.
The US? Well, America hasn’t been a semiconductor hub in quite some time, though the Biden administration is trying its best to change that (with mixed success). But it’s worth noting that the intellectual nerve center of global tech, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, sits on several major fault lines, including the San Andreas Fault. A major earthquake is a matter of when, not if.
Would it be better if more global tech manufacturing was concentrated in a safer place — like Syracuse, New York, perhaps the safest city in the US according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Risk Index? Sure. But that’s highly unlikely to happen.
The reality is that something as incredibly complex as the global tech manufacturing supply chain is inherently going to be fragile. The best we might be able to hope for is that the areas where we have concentrated that vulnerability take every step they can to prepare for that risk. Taiwan — at least when it comes to earthquakes — has done that.",2024-04-04T13:00:00Z,https://www.vox.com,Vox.com
A Photographer Flew His Drone into North Korea,"A photographer flew his drone into North Korea and captured fascinating images of the secretive country.
In a post published on March 28, Redditor XiaoHao2 shared a series of rare photos that he took after allegedly sending is drone into North Korea from Dandong, China in 2020.
“Drone pics of North Korea, I was in China, my drone flew across the border,” XiaoHao2 captions the Reddit post that has been upvoted 141,000 times.
The photographer, who hopes to remain anonymous on Reddit, says that his DJI drone captured images and video clips of the northwestern border city of Sinuiju in North Korea.
Sinuiju, which is the fourth biggest city in North Korea, faces the city of Dandong in China across the Yalu River, also known as the Amnok River.
According to XiaoHao2, the drone images were taken around 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) across the North Korean-China border.
The photographer says it is currently illegal to fly drones into Korea: “Now it’s geofenced, but this was taken in 2020.”
However, it appears that XiaoHao2 had only chosen to share the photos online after years of keeping the risky images to himself.
A Rare Glimpse into the World’s Most Secretive Country
The Redditor’s photos offer a remarkable glimpse into the day-to-day lives of the people of North Korea which is one of the world’s most mysterious and reclusive states.
Some of the photographer’s images show North Korean residents looking up at the drone and noticing it flying past them. In other images, individuals appear visibly startled at the sight the drone crossing into North Korean airspace.
Other eerie images showed mostly empty streets and buildings, including what appears to be a university and a main avenue near Sinuiju Chongnyon Station, according to The Korea Times.
While Redditors applauded XiaoHao2’s images of the closed-off nation, many social media users were concerned about the drone photographer’s safety. However, XiaHao confirmed that he was still “alive and free.”
North Korea has always been shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Its population of roughly 26 million people lives largely in isolation from the rest of the world in the communist state.
The country imposed some of the strictest border controls in the world during the spread of COVID-19, and has yet to fully reopen to foreigners.
People who have entered North Korea as tourists in the past have been met with strict rules about the practice of photography in the country. Travelers are also required to follow designated routes, and places where photography is allowed are severely restricted.

South Korea's Yoon meets doctors in first sign of flexibility over walkout,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday met with the main representative of an association of young doctors who walked off the job in February, in his first in-person talks with physicians opposed to his medical reform plans. The meeting, which Yoon's office said lasted more than two hours, came after he showed the first signs of flexibility in his plan, having previously taken a hardline approach to the dispute.
The centrepiece of Yoon's plan is to raise the number of medical school admissions and increase the number of doctors, but many in the industry are instead concerned about securing better working conditions and legal protection. The government has said that without action the country faces having 15,000 fewer doctors than it needs to maintain essential services largely because its population is rapidly ageing.
Park Dan, who heads the Korean Intern Resident Association, accepted Yoon's invitation to meet with trainee doctors who walked off the job on Feb. 20 and conveyed the views of his colleagues, Yoon's office said in a brief statement. Yoon and Park exchanged views on improving working conditions and compensation for young doctors, it said.
The president's office said he will respect the position of the trainee doctors in his future discussions with the medical community on healthcare reforms, including increasing the number of doctors. The doctors' walkout has disrupted functions at hospitals, leading to patients being turned away and non-emergency surgeries being cut back.
Yoon has said the plan to raise the number of new medical students to 5,000 a year from the current 3,000 is not up for discussion but on Monday signalled there may be room for adjusting his plan if the medical community came forward with reasonable proposals. The country's practicing physicians and medical school professors have demanded Yoon scrap his reform plans.
The drawn-out walkout by thousands of trainee doctors nationwide is increasingly putting strains on the country's healthcare system. While a large majority of the public support the thrust of Yoon's plan, a poll on Monday showed more people are unhappy with the way his government has handled the stalemate.

South Korea’s Doctors’ Walkout Spurs Thousands of Complaints,"Six weeks after thousands of residents and interns at South Korean hospitals walked off the job, frustration is rising.
Patients have filed more than 2,000 complaints about surgeries and other treatments being postponed, canceled or refused, according to the national health ministry. Hospitals have closed wards and restructured staff. Nurses have taken on duties usually performed by physicians, and military doctors have been deployed to public health centers.
Much of the anger over the disruptions is aimed at President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has not backed down from his proposal to dramatically expand medical school admissions to address a shortage of physicians. The young doctors who walked out in February to protest that plan say it wouldn’t solve the health care system’s problems.
But many people are also exasperated with the doctors, despite the exalted position that physicians hold in South Korea’s hierarchical society. Critics accuse them of trying to protect their elite status, and their income, by keeping the number of doctors low.",2024-04-04T04:01:15Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
"Coming to Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI","“We hope to have a few more trolls in the future to connect the state and form a Rhode Island ‘troll trail,’” said Louise Bishop, South County Tourism Council president in a news release.
The trolls, which are made of recycled and reclaimed wood, will be unveiled at Ninigret Park in Charlestown in May. The initiative is part of a push from the South County Tourism council to bring more visitors to the Ocean State.
Two giant trolls are coming to Rhode Island this spring — an art installment of international fame by renowned Danish artist Thomas Dambo.
Dambo’s recycled art is featured more than 20 countries, including in China, Brazil, Australia, Germany, France, and South Korea. In the United States, Dambo’s trolls have drawn crowds in Illinois, Florida, and Kentucky. Five of his trolls, including one that stands nearly three stories tall, are tucked away in the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay.

“I am very much looking forward to coming to Rhode Island,” Dambo said in a press release. “My wife comes from New England, so I really love the area. I came last year for a site visit, I got to see so much of the beautiful area. I have a good idea for an installation with some really big stones. And if I have an obsession, it is that I like big stones.”

Dambo and his team will arrive in South County this month to start building the trolls, and they are looking for help from volunteers. (Interested volunteers can email jcordio@southcountyri.com.)
The imaginative artwork transports visitors to a magical world while conveying the importance of forest preservation, conservation, and our responsibility to the environment around us.
“My mission is Waste No More,” Dambo said in the release. “Our world is drowning in trash, while we are running out of natural resources. I spend my life showing the world that beautiful things can be made out of trash. I give new life to discarded materials by turning them into large-scale artworks. My aim at the moment is to build 1,000 Trolls using recycled materials all over the world.”
