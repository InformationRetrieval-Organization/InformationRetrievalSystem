South Korea says second spy satellite placed in orbit,"As it stands now, polls have Trump and Biden effectively tied, meaning that there’s an opportunity, some might call it a moral imperative, to sway the country away from the dystopian future in which Trump triumphs.
But how exactly do we change voters’ minds?
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
One might believe it’s just a matter of making a persuasive argument, loaded with empirical facts and sound logic, articulated with perfect clarity. This is what the left-wing media often believes, and we have seen how successful that strategy has been — Donald Trump is as influential as ever.
But what if I told you that our neural wiring determines whether we have the ability to change our minds? What if I told you that science suggests conservatives, who are extremely likely to be voting for Trump this election, generally have more rigid cognitive systems, which means they are less adaptable, and therefore, less likely to adopt a new framework or perspective when their approach fails?
A seminal study by social psychologist David Amodio and colleagues at New York University suggests that the typical conservative is not likely to be convinced by something as simple as a logically persuasive argument. For some conservatives, it's like asking them to change the color of their eyes. A progressive worldview cannot pierce their psyche because being dogmatic is programmed into the fabric of that worldview. It is not just that they are “stubborn”; their brains are actually wired to resist things that are new and different. So, you could say they lack “free will” when it comes to their voting decision. When we speak of free will in a modern sense, we are talking about the personal agency that enables one to override ingrained biases and consider alternative perspectives.
To understand the implications of this study, we must voyage into the realm of neuroscience, where secrets of the mind await discovery. The ERN, which stands for “error related negativity,” is a spike in brain activity that is triggered when we commit an error. It serves as a kind of internal alert system within our brain, signaling when a mistake has been made. It emerges in the brain region known as the anterior cingulate cortex, which helps us navigate situations where established patterns or behaviors are ineffective and require adjustment. For example, if a person is learning to play a musical instrument and hits a wrong note, the ERN might spike, prompting them to correct their finger positioning and playing style. Over time, as they practice and adapt, the frequency of these ERN spikes will decrease, indicating improved proficiency and fewer mistakes.
RELATED: This complete psychological analysis reveals 14 key traits that explain Trump supporters
Armed with a knowledge of the nature of the ERN, Dr. Amodio and colleagues ventured into the terrain of politics. Their highly-cited 2007 study revealed an illuminating connection between one's political orientation and the intensity of the ERN response. What they found was that participants with liberal views exhibited a more pronounced ERN. This suggests they have a heightened sensitivity to error signals, indicating a cognitive system that acknowledges the need for adjustments in perspective and strategy. Essentially, when their established behavioral patterns were shown to be incorrect or suboptimal, their brains signaled more intensely for an adaptive response. From these findings, we can conclude that progressive-minded individuals possess a neural predisposition for recognizing the need for change and growth.
Conservatives, on the other hand, exhibited a smaller ERN. This suggests that their cognitive system is more resistant to signals advocating for change or reconsideration. We can think of this as a neural reflection of their preference for stability, tradition and consistency. The typical conservative voter’s mental landscape, sculpted by a combination of genetics and indoctrinating experiences, values the familiar and reliable. Established norms and long-held beliefs provide a safe harbor in the face of a changing society and an uncertain future. It's a mindset where radical shifts or sudden upheavals are perceived not as opportunities but threats to a delicate equilibrium. Conservatism is essentially a neurocognitive inclination aimed at preserving the status quo.
So, what are we supposed to take away from these results? Does it mean there’s no hope for shifting anyone’s stances this election?
One might reasonably conclude that we should simply focus on getting all those already on our ideological side to turn out to the polls on voting day.
But using that strategy alone is risky. We should not give up hope in spreading a progressive worldview, because resistance to change and evolution eventually leads to societal collapse. History has unequivocally demonstrated that. Adaptivity is the key to individual and collective survival. This means we have an ethical obligation to be evangelists for progress and sensible change. This will require a bit of social engineering and some creativity.
Persuading the conservatives intending to vote for Trump is not about convincing them with logic; it is about understanding and navigating their innate preference for stability and tradition. By recognizing the inherent gravitation toward consistency, we see that the presentation of facts or data might not be the most persuasive tool. Effective persuasion demands an approach that's strategically empathetic. Rather than challenging the core of their beliefs head-on, it’s far more effective to frame arguments in a way that resonates with their intrinsic values — stability, tradition and consistency. Narratives and stories that weave in those facts that resonate with their core values will be more compelling. Presenting change not as a rupture, but as a natural evolution of the existing order, can be a more palatable and effective narrative.
To truly sway Republican voters, we must employ more than just arguments. It demands a properly balanced mix of genuine empathy, clever communication strategy and a basic grasp of the neurocognitive biases shaping their perspectives.
In the end, the outcome of the election may well hinge on our ability to navigate the cognitive labyrinth of the conservative mind.

South Korea launches its second military spy satellite,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea has successfully launched its second military spy satellite into orbit, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year — North Korea in November and South Korea in December — amid heightened animosities. They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.
South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the satellite entered orbit and communicated with an overseas ground station after separation from a rocket.
“With the success of the second military spy satellite launch, our military has acquired an additional independent surveillance ability and further bolstered our ‘kill chain’ capability,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha Gyu told reporters, referring to the military’s preemptive missile strike capability.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025. South Korea’s first spy satellite launch on Dec. 1 was made from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base.
South Korea in 2022 became the world’s 10th nation to successfully launch a satellite with its own technology by using a homegrown rocket to place what it called a “performance observation satellite” in orbit. But experts say it’s economical to use a SpaceX rocket to launch spy satellite and that South Korea needs more launches to ensure the reliability of a rocket.
North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik said Monday that North Korea will likely go ahead with its second spy satellite launch soon to mark the April 15 birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Shin said it’s still possible for the North to perform the launch later due to technical reasons.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response. Experts say North Korea likely believes that an enlarged weapons arsenals would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.

SEOUL, April 8 (UPI) -- South Korea successfully placed its second military reconnaissance satellite into orbit, Seoul's military said Monday, a move that will heighten surveillance capabilities against North Korea amid a growing space race on the peninsula. The launch took place on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which was Monday morning in Seoul, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a press release. Advertisement
The satellite was carried on a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and successfully entered orbit around 45 minutes after launch. It later succeeded in communicating with a ground station, the ministry said.
In addition to increased surveillance capacity, the satellite will enhance South Korea's ""Kill Chain"" system, the ministry added. The Kill Chain is part of a three-pronged deterrence strategy that calls for preemptive strikes against the North's missiles -- and possibly its leadership -- in the event of a potential attack.
Monday's launch marked the second of five military reconnaissance satellites that Seoul has contracted with SpaceX to place into orbit by 2025. South Korea launched its first satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Dec. 1, less than two weeks after North Korea placed its own inaugural spy satellite into orbit.

The new satellite is equipped with synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, which can capture images at night and under any weather conditions, defense officials said.
""With the success of this launch, our military has further strengthened its space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,"" South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said after viewing a live stream of the launch at ministry headquarters. ""Now, even in bad weather, it has become possible to monitor the whole of North Korea clearly and precisely.""
North Korea announced plans last week to launch several more spy satellites of its own this year, amid concerns over its growing military relationship with Russia.
Washington and its allies say that Pyongyang is shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
Shin said that the South's satellite technology is far superior to that of the North and promised that upcoming launches will further widen the gap in the space race.
""By next year, we plan to launch a follow-up military reconnaissance satellite and an ultra-small satellite that is currently under development,"" he said. ""We will have an overwhelming intelligence superiority that cannot be compared with North Korea.""",2024-04-08T06:06:00Z,https://www.upi.com

South Korea’s Election Is About ‘Gladiator Politics’,"The elections are ostensibly about the 300 seats in Parliament, but when South Koreans go to the polls on Wednesday, they will also be signaling support for one of two leaders who are locked in what is known here as “gladiator politics.”
The do-or-die rivalry between President Yoon Suk Yeol and the opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds the majority in the National Assembly, has made the elections as fraught with fear and resentment as any in South Korea​n history. Neither leader commands broad popularity, instead relying on hard-line supporters who either want to see Mr. Yoon, a conservative, impeached for abuse of power, or Mr. Lee, a progressive, imprisoned for corruption.
“This election is about who you want to punish, Yoon Suk Yeol or Lee Jae-myung,” said Eom Kyeong-young, an election analyst at the Zeitgeist Institute in Seoul.
On the global stage, South Korea is the dynamic exporter of cars, phones, K-pop and K-dramas. But at home, voter discontent runs deep. The country’s economy is slowing. Its birthrate is the world’s lowest. Its Gen Z youth — frustrated with widening economic inequity and priced out of the housing market — fear that they will be the first generation in the country’s history economically worse off than their parents.",2024-04-07T04:01:14Z,https://www.nytimes.com
GIST Researchers Find the Link Between Human Activity and Shifting Weather Patterns in Western North America,"GWANGJU, South Korea, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Western North America seems to be experiencing more extreme weather events more frequently. From scorching droughts to torrential floods, the climate is changing rapidly, with no signs of slowing down. From 2011 to 2015, California and neighboring states experienced extended periods of drought, while 2017 saw heavy rains trigger catastrophic floods.
These events are linked to specific weather patterns. The atmosphere is like a network of interconnected pathways that determine how weather systems move and interact across the globe. In the Northern Hemisphere, there are three such major teleconnection patterns that affect winter conditions: the Pacific North American pattern (PNA), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the North American winter dipole (NAWD). However, the understanding of how these patterns change over time and their connection to climate change remains limited.
To better understand this phenomenon, a group of scientists led by Professor of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering Jin-Ho Yoon and including Ph.D. student Jueun Lee from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology recently conducted a study to examine the reasons behind changes in these patterns. Their findings have been published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science on 7 March 2024.
The scientists employed a sophisticated Community Earth System model that there is a regular influence of the NAWD for over 70 years (1951-2020), which is in contrast with the fluctuating influence from PNA and minor impacts from NAO. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a strengthening negative correlation between the PNA and the NAWD: as one exhibits a positive phase, the other tends to exhibit a negative phase. “This projected intensification of large-scale atmospheric circulation in a warming climate is expected to likely escalate extreme hydroclimatic events in mid-latitude regions like California near western North America,” explains Dr. Yoon.
The weather system is like a network of dominos, where one piece can trigger a chain reaction and set off a series of unforeseen events. Using extensive models and numerical simulations, the scientists deduced that these changes in how the PNA and the NAWD interact can be traced back to variations in the jet stream, a band-like flow of air high up in the atmosphere. As the climate warms, the jet stream changes, influencing patterns such as the PNA and the NAWD.
The study notably shows that greenhouse gas emissions play a significant role in driving the shifts. “Climate models consider a range of factors affecting the atmosphere, including changes in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities. By running simulations with and without the influence of greenhouse gases, we can compare the results and see how they differ,” explains Dr. Yoon. The scientists observed an association between higher greenhouse gas levels and the variations in the jet stream: the gases drive the northward drift of the Asia-Pacific jet core. Aided by mountain-related lifting over the Alaskan Range, contributing to the formation of potent high-pressure systems in the vicinity. This phenomenon strengthens the winter stationary wave throughout western North America.
Simply put, the study shows that the rise in temperatures caused by greenhouse gases is changing how air moves in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects the weather patterns that influence winter conditions in western North America and contribute to recent more frequent extreme weather events.

"China plans to disrupt US elections using AI-generated content, Microsoft claims","wildpixel/Getty Images
The Chinese government is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts to disrupt elections around the world, Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Team has warned. Microsoft claims that a host of Chinese state-backed cyber criminal groups are planning to use AI to interfere with elections in 2024 in the US, India, and South Korea. The company's security experts added that North Korea is also participating in the effort, which could span a variety of channels, including social media.
""China is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favor,"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""China has also increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world.""
Also: How AI will fool voters in 2024 if we don't do something now
Microsoft added that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backs cybercriminal groups that, in recent months, have tried to divide Americans on a variety of recent events, including claiming that the US government may have been involved in the Kentucky train derailment in November 2023, that the US is intentionally poisoning foreign water supplies, the reasons for drug use in the US, as well as ""immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.""
At the same time, Microsoft, which has monitored the group's communications across channels, said that ""there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion.""
Governments across the globe have always used technology extensively to influence public opinion, and especially in the past decade. Soon after the 2016 US election, several reports suggested the Russian government was actively attempting to spread misinformation to sway US public opinion. Other reports have suggested that China, the US, and many other countries have similarly engaged in cyber techniques that aim to convince people around the globe to side with their initiatives.
However, as AI becomes more sophisticated, the risks of spreading misinformation only grow. With the ability to create fake images, videos, and other types of content, it's possible for governments and government-backed cyber criminal groups to target many more people with far more believable content.
According to Microsoft, North Korea's involvement in the efforts center not necessarily on swaying elections, but on generating revenue for the country. North Korea already engages in stealing cryptocurrency funds and attacking supply chain software.
""The United Nations estimates that North Korean cyber actors have stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency since 2017,"" Microsoft said. ""Heists totaling between $600 million and $1 billion occurred in 2023 alone.""
Also: Tech giants promise to combat fraudulent AI content in mega elections year
Looking ahead, Microsoft said that based on China's activities so far, the chances of the country impacting global elections remains low. However, that doesn't mean this couldn't change in the future.
""We assess that China will, at a minimum, create and amplify AI-generated content to benefit its interests,"" Microsoft said. ""Despite the chances of such content in affecting election results remaining low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will likely continue – and may prove more effective down the line.""",2024-04-05T13:29:00Z,https://www.zdnet.com
Early voting kicks off with heavy turnout in South Korea elections,"1 of 5 | Early voting began on Friday for next week's National Assembly election in South Korea, a contest widely seen as a referendum on the administration of current President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photo by Thomas Maresca/UPI
SEOUL, April 5 (UPI) -- South Korean voters turned out in record-setting numbers for early voting Friday ahead of next week's parliamentary elections, which are widely seen as a midterm referendum on the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Voters began casting ballots at 3,565 polling stations nationwide in a two-day early voting period before the main vote on Wednesday for the 300-member National Assembly. Advertisement
When the polls closed at 6 p.m., some 6.91 million people, or 15.61% of eligible voters, had cast a ballot, according to the National Election Commission. It was the highest figure ever in early voting for a general election and well above the 12.04% turnout at the same time four years ago.
Yoon's People Power Party is aiming to take the majority in the National Assembly, which is currently dominated by the opposition Democratic Party.
In 2022, the conservative Yoon narrowly edged out his opponent Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party by a razor-thin margin. A Democratic Party-led bloc has held 180 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly since 2020, however, severely hampering Yoon's domestic agenda.
Advertisement
A poll released last week by Gallup Korea showed the PPP with greater support than the Democratic Party, at 37% to 29%. But Yoon's party would need to flip more than 30 seats to take control of the parliament, widely considered a tall order.
That task is made more difficult as Yoon has been saddled with low approval ratings over his handling of a wide range of issues from sky-high housing prices and soaring food costs to concerns over the country's plunging birth rate, which is the lowest in the world.
Last week's Gallup Korea poll saw his support drop from a recent high of 39% to 34% ahead of the election.
Yoon has also been at the center of a standoff with striking trainee doctors that has dragged on since February, while his administration has been beset by corruption allegations, including a highly publicized scandal around First Lady Kim Keon Hee accepting the gift of a Dior bag.
Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is facing corruption challenges of his own and is currently facing trials over a range of charges including bribery.
Next week's result will play a large role in Yoon's ability to press ahead with his agenda over the remaining three years of his mandatory single five-year term.

On the domestic front, Yoon has long been aiming to push through economic reforms that include taking on labor unions and reducing regulations on businesses. He has had more success establishing his agenda on the foreign policy front, where Seoul has taken a harder line against North Korea and strengthened security cooperation with the United States and Japan.
Yoon cast his vote early Friday morning in Busan while on an official visit to the city.
Lee also voted early in the central city of Daejeon.
""In the end, it's up to the people to decide, and I would like to ask you to vote early today and tomorrow,"" Lee said. ""If you give up your sovereignty, if you give up your vote, all that you give up goes to a few vested interests.""
While South Korea's political landscape is dominated by the two main parties, a wild card this year is the rise of third parties in recent polls. The progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, led by disgraced former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, has emerged as the third most popular party and is drawing voters disillusioned with the status quo.
In the last Gallup Korea poll, the party -- which was only formed in February -- had 12% support, highlighting the possibility of gaining enough seats to play a spoiler role in the tightly contested parliament.

SEOUL – Soaring prices for green onions and apples. Striking doctors. A politician's allegedly sexist jab at a female candidate. These are among the issues animating voters in South Korea this year.
As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues, staying away from traditionally popular agendas like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.

“I feel drawn to someone who talks about things that can be truly helpful to our neighborhoods,” said Kim Yun-ah, a 45-year-old Seoul officer worker. “I often don’t know when North Korea test-fired missiles.”
Experts say up to about 30% or 40% of South Korea’s 44 million voters are politically neutral and that who they end up supporting will likely determine the results of the April 10 elections.
A look at the upcoming South Korean elections and the issues affecting voters’ sentiments.
MODERATES
South Korea’s conservative-liberal divide is so stark that many voters likely have already determined who they'll vote for according to their party affiliation, rather than by looking at the policies of the candidates in their districts.
But the extreme polarization has led to an expansion of moderates who are fed up with partisan strife and who focus more on livelihoods issues such as prices, jobs and taxes, according to Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.
Choi estimated that roughly 30% of South Koreas are conservatives, another 30% liberals and the remaining 40% moderates. Other experts put the proportion of moderates at 30%.
“In a nutshell, even if conservatives and liberals intensely bicker over political issues, that won’t influence election results much,” Choi said. “The fate of an election is rather determined by the moderates who silently monitor livelihood issues and decide who to vote for.”
Some observers say liberal opposition parties could retain their majority status, making conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol — whose single five-year term ends in 2027 — an early lame duck. But others note many moderates are still undecided, so it’s too early to predict who would win.
Regardless of the electoral outcome, Yoon's major foreign policy agendas would remain unchanged, such as boosting security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan and taking a tough line on North Korea's nuclear program, experts say.
GREEN ONIONS
Yoon got more than he bargained for when he visited a Seoul grocery mall last month to promote government efforts to tame food prices but ended up inviting criticism by talking about the prices of green onions.
Looking at a bundle of green onions with a price tag of 875 won ($0.65) — a temporary discount price offered thanks to a government subsidy — Yoon said that “I’ve been to lots of markets, and I would say 875 won is a reasonable price.”
Meanwhile, the average retail prices of green onions has hovered around 3,000 to 4,000 won ($2.2 to 2.9) in past weeks, reaching some of the highest levels in recent years.
Yoon's throw-away comment has created a mini-crisis for his ruling People Power Party as candidates from the main liberal opposition Democratic Party have brought green onions to election rallies and accused Yoon of underestimating food prices and being out of touch of the reality.
It’s not just green onions. The prices of agricultural products during March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The prices of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.
Kim Tae-hyung, a 55-year-old moderate liberal, said he's almost decided to vote for a liberal opposition candidate running in his constituency because he believes the Yoon government hasn't done well on economy issues.
But he said Yoon doesn't deserve criticism over his green onion remarks. “Even if he doesn't know the price of green onions, I don't think it matters much as I also didn't know about it,"" Kim said.
STRIKING DOCTORS
The weekslong strikes by thousands of doctors is another headache for Yoon's party.
The doctors, all medical interns and residents, are protesting against Yoon's push to increase the yearly medical school admission cap by two thirds to create more doctors. They say universities can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that would undermine the country's future medical services, though critics say they simply worry about lower income in the wake of the supply of more doctors.
South Korea has one of the world's fastest-aging populations and its doctors-to-population ratio is among the lowest in the developed world. But efforts to add seats at medical schools is a politically risky project that past governments had already failed to achieve because of similar vehement protests by incumbent doctors and medical students.
Yoon initially enjoyed a rising approval rating over his recruitment plan, but now faces growing calls for a compromise as the doctors' strikes have caused numerous cancelled surgeries at hospitals and other inconveniences for patients.
“We absolutely need to raise the medical school quota. But the government is pushing for its increase in a too steep, abrupt manner that has surprised everyone,” said Lee Chul-seung, a liberal Seoul citizen in his mid-50s.
TOXIC RHETORIC
Fueled by contempt for the other side, the rival parties have spewed highly offensive, abusive language against each other.
When Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party chairman, criticized senior ruling party candidate Na Kyung-won over her alleged pro-Japanese views, he called her “nabe,” a combination of parts of the names of Na and late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon quickly called Lee's comments ""extreme misogyny."" Nabe in Japanese means pot, whose Korean translation is “naembi"" that can be used as a derogatory slang term to refer to a woman with many sex partners. Last month, supporters of Na's liberal rival candidate reportedly spread on social media a poster with a message saying “naembi tastes best when it's trampled on.""
Han labelled Lee's past comments as “trash,” drawing rebukes from Lee's party spokesperson who described “Han's mouth” “as ”trash bin.""
Also roiling the South Korean election race is former liberal justice minister Cho Kuk, whose newly launched small party is forecast by surveys to win 10-15 seats. Cho was once a rising political star during the government of Yoon's liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, until he faced a slew of scandals that hurt his reformist image and sharply split the nation.
Han called Cho “a shameless petty criminal.” Cho said Han, Yoon and Yoon's wife and first lady Kim Keon Hee “representative people of a criminal group.”",2024-04-05T04:13:47Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com
Naver CEO to fight against U.S. Big Tech in AI arms race,"Internet firm Naver has earned its nickname—Korea’s Google—by pulling off an improbable feat: It dominates South Korea’s search market, having defended its turf from Google, the world’s top search engine, whose revenue is 40 times as large as Naver’s.
As of September 2023, Naver controlled 59% of Korea’s search market to Google’s 31%.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon,” says Choi Soo-yeon, Naver’s CEO since 2022.
Naver is hardly a household name outside Korea. But it operates a sprawling portfolio that pits the $22-billion-in-market-cap firm against other Big Tech giants on multiple fronts.
It has a controlling stake in both Yahoo Japan—the most popular website in Japan, according to Nielsen—and the Japanese messaging app Line—a WhatsApp rival—through a joint venture with SoftBank.
It runs Korea’s No. 2 e-commerce service, behind Coupang. (Amazon’s platform ranks fourth.) Naver’s $1.2 billion purchase last year of Poshmark, the U.S.-based clothing-resale site, expanded its retail reach.
In the streaming wars era, Naver has amassed content platforms of its own. It owns Webtoon, which hosts mobile-friendly comic strips that are popular across Asia. (Naver is reportedly planning a U.S. IPO for Webtoon later this year.) Naver bought Wattpad, a Canada-based platform for user-submitted fiction, for $600 million in 2021.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon.” Choi Soo-yeon, Naver CEO
Naver also has a small but growing cloud-computing business—a category in which Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reign supreme—and it’s launched a series of AI projects to contend with the release of OpenAI’s viral chatbot, ChatGPT.
In recent quarters, Naver’s many business lines have notched record revenues and operating profits, but Choi sees Naver’s mission as extending beyond its own bottom line.
Despite Naver’s small size, she casts the firm as a counterpoint in a global tech scene in which power is concentrated among a gargantuan few.
“It’s becoming a world where there are only one or two search companies and one or two commerce companies,” Choi said in a recent wide-ranging interview—her first with the international press—at Naver headquarters in Seongnam, just outside Seoul. (Choi gave her answers in Korean, which were later translated into English.) Naver “is a company that constantly fights against such a world and strives to preserve diversity,” she says.
Investors question whether Naver can go toe-to-toe with cash-rich rivals. Still, Choi’s goal is ambitious—perhaps even noble—and belies the role she was appointed to fill: that of a caretaker CEO brought on to steady a company in turmoil.
Choi, 42, was an unconventional pick to run the company. A Harvard-educated M&A lawyer, she joined Naver in 2019 as head of global business support to help lead the firm’s expansion. Three years later, the board named Choi as CEO to show it was prepared to overhaul its culture after a series of crises.
In May 2021, a senior Naver developer died by suicide after accusing the company of fostering a toxic work culture. A labor union probe found he’d been bullied by executives for years. A later government survey found that over half of employees felt they were bullied at least once in a six-month period.
In the aftermath, Naver said “there were some acts of workplace harassment by some executives.” Choi’s predecessor as CEO, Han Seong-sook, stepped down, as did Naver’s COO, and Naver tapped Choi. At the time, she told shareholders her most urgent task was “to recover Naver’s corporate culture based on trust and autonomy.”
But a second tragedy struck early in Choi’s tenure. In September 2022, another employee died by suicide while on maternity leave, local media reported. Months later, her family claimed she’d been mistreated at work. A Naver internal investigation did not uncover evidence of harassment, and Korea’s labor ministry could not confirm the family’s claims, a company spokesperson said.
South Korea has the highest rate of suicide of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and South Koreans work 200 hours more per year than the global average.
“There was a lack of trust in the systems, leadership, and board,” Choi says of Naver’s previous culture. One big change Choi made was to reintroduce remote work, a rarity in post-COVID South Korea. The option gives employees “the choice of what kind of working environment they can be most productive and create the most innovation in.”
The suicides were the biggest scandal to rock Naver in its 25-year history. Naver launched in 1999, when founder Lee Hae-jin turned an internal Samsung project into an independent company. By the mid-2000s, Naver had passed rivals like web portal Daum to dominate Korea’s search market.
Naver and fellow internet firm Kakao (founded by an ex-Naver executive) have made South Korea one of a handful of countries where homegrown search engines outperform U.S. search giants without government intervention.
Naver got a head start on tailoring a search engine that met the tastes of the South Korean market, says Bokyung Suh, a Korea analyst at Bernstein Research. Naver hooked users early with its busy homepage that was heavy on icons, links, and animations. Google launched a bare-bones search engine in Korean in 2000, but it didn’t catch on. Google updated its site to a feature-rich format six years later.
Naver earned 9.6 trillion won ($7.41 billion) in revenue in 2023, a record. Search and e-commerce generated 37% and 26% of sales, respectively. It made $1.3 billion in operating profit, also a record.
Yet shares are currently trading about 60% below a COVID-era high. Investors are concerned about slowing revenue from search (up 0.6% in 2023), plummeting revenue from display ads (down 10% last year), and the lack of a “punchy, clear growth strategy,” Suh says.
Naver’s lack of a punchy, clear growth strategy is especially worrisome in the AI age, when Naver faces U.S. companies that are investing billions in the technology.
As U.S. giants dominate English-based AI, Naver may be able to establish an edge in systems based in Korean and other languages, Choi says.
Naver has a chatbot, CLOVA X, and an AI-powered search engine, Cue. Both are built on its Korean-language large-language model, HyperCLOVA X, which outperforms OpenAI’s GPT in Korean, recent studies say. Naver has claimed that HyperCLOVA, an earlier version of its model, was trained on 6,500 times as much Korean data as GPT-3.0, which underpins OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Naver is also partnering with Saudi Aramco on an Arabic large-language model.
Choi is especially interested in what she calls “sovereign AI,” or a model that’s tailored to an individual user. “We focus on what companies and governments that want to use AI would want, and what needs Big Tech can’t fulfill,” she says. As AI becomes more common, “each group will need an AI model that best understands” its unique traits.

Much like her rivals at Google and Microsoft, Choi is also grappling with how to integrate AI—with its penchant to hallucinate false information—into Naver’s search product. “People need accurate information through search,” she says, though she hopes AI’s tendency to make stuff up will become “nearly negligible in the near future.”
At the same time, she also sees room for a traditional search engine—with its list of links to choose from—amid the generative AI revolution. “Not all questions in the world have a single correct answer,” she says. “There is still a need for exploration.”
Naver’s base in South Korea, a chip powerhouse, is an advantage in the AI race, especially its homegrown manufacturers “that support the Korean language,” Choi says. Naver’s chip partners include Korea’s Samsung and the U.S.’s Intel.
“It’s not healthy to rely on just one company,” Choi says. Is that a coded reference to Nvidia? Yes, she says in English, with a smile.
Just four of South Korea’s top 100 firms by revenue had women CEOs last year, according to global headhunter UnicoSearch. Just 6% of executives at the companies were women.
Choi, whose CEO contract expires in 2025, expresses some unease at often being a “sole woman” in business: “Simply because I am a woman, there are expectations for me to demonstrate skills such as effective communication, adept conflict resolution, and the ability to nurture people.”
Korea’s internet sector got a little more diverse when Kakao appointed its first female CEO, Shina Chung, in March.
“I’m not alone anymore!” Choi says.

"Hualien, Taiwan earthquake: Toll on Taiwan’s chip industry","When a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan’s eastern coast on April 3, the first concern involved the risk to people and property. Here, the news was not as dire as initially feared — only nine people have been reported killed as of Wednesday evening, along with hundreds of injuries. Considering that Wednesday’s quake was the strongest in Taiwan in 25 years — and that earthquakes of similar strength have killed tens of thousands of people or more in other countries — this could have been much worse.
Taiwan was largely able to withstand such a powerful quake because the island has taken earthquake preparation seriously, strengthening its building codes after past disasters and drilling its population in how to respond. The newest buildings tended to fare best — the 1,670-foot Taipei 101, the island’s tallest building and designed to dampen shaking in a quake, barely moved.
There was one other way in which Taiwan — and the world — avoided a worse outcome from the earthquake: the island’s all-important semiconductor manufacturing industry seemed to emerge largely intact. That’s good news — but it’s also a reminder of how fragile some of the most important nodes of the global economy remain.
The world’s computers can’t run without Taiwan
To say that Taiwan is important to the global tech industry is like saying oxygen is important to breathing. Taiwan as a whole is responsible for making 80 to 90 percent of the world’s most advanced computer chips — ones for which there is no current substitute. Taiwan’s TSMC makes up half of that production on its own, and 90 percent of the chips TSMC makes are produced in its 12 fabrication plants — or “fabs” — on the island.
Fortunately, all of those fabs are on the western side of the island, away from the epicenter of the April 3 quake. Even a slight vibration, though, is enough to throw off the highly sensitive work of semiconductor manufacturing, and some machinery was halted or even damaged. But TSMC reported that production was getting back to normal within a few hours of the quake.
Again, preparation made a difference — TSMC has invested heavily in earthquake resilience in its fabs, which the company says are designed well beyond code.
But part of the reason that Taiwan has made itself so resilient to earthquakes is that it has a long history of … earthquakes. The island sits on the Ring of Fire, which is the unusually cool name for the 25,000-mile long belt of volcanoes and earthquakes that surround the Pacific Ocean. As a result, Taiwan experiences around a thousand earthquakes per year that are strong enough to be felt, and many more that aren’t. And just last year Taipei discovered an actual active volcano within its city limits.
After a 1999 earthquake that did more damage to Taiwan’s chip-building infrastructure, the electronics industry was disrupted for weeks — and that was at a time when tech and computer chips were far less important to the global economy than they are today, when chips are found in everything from cars to refrigerators. A Credit Suisse analysis found that if TSMC’s operations were to be somehow shut down — perhaps by an even more massive quake — manufacturing across the global economy would be severely disrupted.
And, of course, earthquakes and volcanoes are just one threat to Taiwan’s semiconductor foundries. The better known one is just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s Republic of China has made it increasingly clear that it could be willing to use military power to force reunification with what it regards as a renegade province. Should Taiwan’s chip foundries be destroyed in such a conflict, the damage to the global economy could be on par with the Great Depression.
The fragile points of global tech
Is it the safest thing in the world to concentrate production of perhaps the single most important manufactured component of the global economy on one island that faces existential threats of both the seismic and geopolitical varieties (plus the occasional typhoon)? Not really.
But Taiwan is hardly the only critical node in tech manufacturing that happens to be located in a risky part of the world.
South Korea is maybe the second-most important location for semiconductor fabrication after Taiwan, with a 60 percent market share of the memory chips used in PCs and smartphones, and is the home of the major global tech player Samsung. South Korea also abuts North Korea, a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator who appears to be increasingly flirting with the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. It’s also at risk from storms and flooding, though at least its tectonics are fairly stable. (Maybe?)
How about Japan? It’s no longer the dominant player it was in the go-go 1980s, though the government has spent billions to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the country, and it now has about 10 percent of the global market. Japan is also one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth — it’s at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and typhoons. And should a war with either North Korea or with China over Taiwan come to pass, Japan will surely be on the front line.
The US? Well, America hasn’t been a semiconductor hub in quite some time, though the Biden administration is trying its best to change that (with mixed success). But it’s worth noting that the intellectual nerve center of global tech, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, sits on several major fault lines, including the San Andreas Fault. A major earthquake is a matter of when, not if.
Would it be better if more global tech manufacturing was concentrated in a safer place — like Syracuse, New York, perhaps the safest city in the US according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Risk Index? Sure. But that’s highly unlikely to happen.
The reality is that something as incredibly complex as the global tech manufacturing supply chain is inherently going to be fragile. The best we might be able to hope for is that the areas where we have concentrated that vulnerability take every step they can to prepare for that risk. Taiwan — at least when it comes to earthquakes — has done that.",2024-04-04T13:00:00Z,https://www.vox.com
A Photographer Flew His Drone into North Korea,"A photographer flew his drone into North Korea and captured fascinating images of the secretive country.
In a post published on March 28, Redditor XiaoHao2 shared a series of rare photos that he took after allegedly sending is drone into North Korea from Dandong, China in 2020.
“Drone pics of North Korea, I was in China, my drone flew across the border,” XiaoHao2 captions the Reddit post that has been upvoted 141,000 times.
The photographer, who hopes to remain anonymous on Reddit, says that his DJI drone captured images and video clips of the northwestern border city of Sinuiju in North Korea.
Sinuiju, which is the fourth biggest city in North Korea, faces the city of Dandong in China across the Yalu River, also known as the Amnok River.
According to XiaoHao2, the drone images were taken around 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) across the North Korean-China border.
The photographer says it is currently illegal to fly drones into Korea: “Now it’s geofenced, but this was taken in 2020.”
However, it appears that XiaoHao2 had only chosen to share the photos online after years of keeping the risky images to himself.
A Rare Glimpse into the World’s Most Secretive Country
The Redditor’s photos offer a remarkable glimpse into the day-to-day lives of the people of North Korea which is one of the world’s most mysterious and reclusive states.
Some of the photographer’s images show North Korean residents looking up at the drone and noticing it flying past them. In other images, individuals appear visibly startled at the sight the drone crossing into North Korean airspace.
Other eerie images showed mostly empty streets and buildings, including what appears to be a university and a main avenue near Sinuiju Chongnyon Station, according to The Korea Times.
While Redditors applauded XiaoHao2’s images of the closed-off nation, many social media users were concerned about the drone photographer’s safety. However, XiaHao confirmed that he was still “alive and free.”
North Korea has always been shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Its population of roughly 26 million people lives largely in isolation from the rest of the world in the communist state.
The country imposed some of the strictest border controls in the world during the spread of COVID-19, and has yet to fully reopen to foreigners.
People who have entered North Korea as tourists in the past have been met with strict rules about the practice of photography in the country. Travelers are also required to follow designated routes, and places where photography is allowed are severely restricted.

South Korea’s Doctors’ Walkout Spurs Thousands of Complaints,"Six weeks after thousands of residents and interns at South Korean hospitals walked off the job, frustration is rising.
Patients have filed more than 2,000 complaints about surgeries and other treatments being postponed, canceled or refused, according to the national health ministry. Hospitals have closed wards and restructured staff. Nurses have taken on duties usually performed by physicians, and military doctors have been deployed to public health centers.
Much of the anger over the disruptions is aimed at President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has not backed down from his proposal to dramatically expand medical school admissions to address a shortage of physicians. The young doctors who walked out in February to protest that plan say it wouldn’t solve the health care system’s problems.
But many people are also exasperated with the doctors, despite the exalted position that physicians hold in South Korea’s hierarchical society. Critics accuse them of trying to protect their elite status, and their income, by keeping the number of doctors low.",2024-04-04T04:01:15Z,https://www.nytimes.com
"Coming to Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI","“We hope to have a few more trolls in the future to connect the state and form a Rhode Island ‘troll trail,’” said Louise Bishop, South County Tourism Council president in a news release.

SK hynix Signs Investment Agreement of Advanced Chip Packaging with Indiana,"To build advanced packaging facility for next-generation HBM, while collaborating with Purdue University for R&D
Selects Indiana for strong support provided by the state and local government, infrastructure for manufacturing, and talent at Purdue .
Industry’s first investment in advanced packaging for AI products on American soil, strengthens supply-chain resilience
SEOUL, South Korea, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — SK hynix Inc. (or “the company”, www.skhynix.com), the world’s leading producer of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, announced today that it will invest an estimated $3.87 billion in West Lafayette, Indiana to build an advanced packaging fabrication and R&D facility for AI products. The project, the first of its kind in the United States, is expected to drive innovation in the nation’s AI supply chain, while bringing more than a thousand new jobs to the region.
The company held an investment agreement ceremony with officials from Indiana State, Purdue University, and the U.S. government at Purdue University in West Lafayette on the 3rd and officially announced the plan.
At the event, officials from each party including Governor of Indiana Eric Holcomb, Senator Todd Young, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Arun Venkataraman, Secretary of Commerce State of Indiana David Rosenberg, Purdue University President Mung Chiang, Chairman of Purdue Research Foundation Mitch Daniels, Mayor of city of West Lafayette Erin Easter, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States Hyundong Cho, Consul General of the Republic of Korea in Chicago Junghan Kim, SK vice chairman Jeong Joon Yu, SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung and SK hynix Head of Package & Test Choi Woojin, participated.
Leveraging its dominant position in the HBM market, SK hynix’s new facility will be home to an advanced semiconductor production line that will mass-produce next-generation HBM, the highest-performing Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, which are the critical components of graphic processing units that train AI systems such as ChatGPT.
* HBM (High Bandwidth Memory): A high-value, high-performance memory that vertically interconnects multiple DRAM chips and dramatically increases data processing speed in comparison with conventional DRAM products. HBM4 is the sixth generation of its kind, following HBM, HBM2, HBM2E, HBM3 and HBM3E.
The company plans to begin mass production in the second half of 2028, while the new facility will also develop future generations of chips and house an advanced packaging R&D line. The site was selected due to Indiana’s resilient manufacturing infrastructure and R&D ecosystem, expert intellectuals in the semiconductor field and the talent pipeline at Purdue University, and the strong support provided by the state and local government.
Innovation in memory chips continues to drive lower-power operations and performance enhancements in computing. As tech shrinkage and other hardware improvements have hit limits, SK hynix’s new chiplet packaging technology has emerged as a promising way to continue enhancing density and performance. As this heterogeneous integration technology becomes more and more important to the future of the semiconductor industry, the company’s new initiative in Indiana will help establish the region as a Silicon Heartland: a new semiconductor cluster centered in the Midwest Triangle that will become a magnet for next-generation computing in the AI era.
“Indiana is a global leader in innovating and producing the products that will power our future economy, and today’s news is proof positive to that fact,” said Governor Eric Holcomb. “I’m so proud to officially welcome SK hynix to Indiana, and we’re confident this new partnership will enhance the Lafayette-West Lafayette region, Purdue University and the state of Indiana for the long term. This new semiconductor innovation and packaging plant not only reaffirms the state’s role in the hard tech sector, but is also another tremendous step forward in advancing U.S. innovation and national security, putting Hoosiers at the forefront of national and global advancements.”
U.S. Senator Todd Young, a key advocate for the project, said, “SK hynix will soon be a household name in Indiana. This incredible investment demonstrates their confidence in Hoosier workers, and I’m excited to welcome them to our state.” Adding, “The CHIPS and Science Act opened a door that Indiana has been able to sprint through, and companies like SK hynix are helping to build our high-tech future.”
“SK hynix is the global pioneer and dominant market leader in memory chips for AI,” Purdue University President Mung Chiang said. “This transformational investment reflects our state and university’s tremendous strength in semiconductors, hardware AI, and hard tech corridor. It is also a monumental moment for completing the supply chain of digital economy in our country through chips advanced packaging. Located at Purdue Research Park, the largest facility of its kind at a U.S. university will grow and succeed through innovation.”

Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup car brings extreme EV performance to the track,"The Hyundai Ioniq 5 N is one of the most extreme EVs you can buy at the moment. With over 600 horsepower delivered to all four wheels, plus a plethora of drive modes that help you do everything from circuit racing to drifting, it's a truly wild ride.
But it's about to get even wilder. Meet the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 N eN1 Cup car. This is a lightweight, caged, and big-winged version of Hyundai's rocket ship, tuned to such an extreme level that it isn't even road legal. Yes, this one's strictly for racing, and Hyundai is launching a focused racing series for the 5 N later this year.
Ahead of that, I headed to Korea to take it for a drive on a closed track. Inje Speedium is a tricky circuit with lots of elevation changes, and despite some inclement weather the Ioniq 5 N eN1 proved to be a masterful drive. And, at $100,000, for a track-ready machine, it's surprisingly value-priced. Watch the video above for the full story.",2024-04-03T16:00:24Z,https://www.engadget.com
"Saudi Arabia-South Korea ties grow with industry push, pivot east","April 3, 2024
A South Korean automotive company announced plans on Tuesday to establish a production plant in Saudi Arabia, bolstering the kingdom’s automotive plans as the Gulf pivots east.
Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicles signed a memorandum of understanding in Riyadh with construction equipment provider Saudi Diesel Equipment and Saudi steel fabricator Perfect Arabia Factory. The two Saudi firms will locally assemble Tata Daewoo trucks, the latter said in a press release.
Tata Daewoo first entered the Saudi market in 2014 after signing a sales contract with Saudi Diesel Equipment to market the former's trucks. The company exported 670 large trucks to the kingdom and recorded $35.5 million in sales in 2023. The South Korean firm aims to boost its exports to 1,000 trucks per year, according to the release.
Why it matters: The announcement of the project comes as Saudi Arabia seeks to boost its domestic automobile industry. The kingdom currently imports the majority of its vehicles, bringing in some $13.2 billion worth of cars in 2022, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Exports, on the other hand, stood at just $19 million that same year.",2024-04-03T15:34:24Z,https://www.al-monitor.com
US Ally Seizes Chinese Vessels,"South Korea's Coast Guard seized five Chinese vessels for allegedly fishing illegally in the country's waters late last month, confiscating boats and deporting several crew members.
The coast guard said it carried out the raid while on patrol with the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries within the country's exclusive economic zone.
An exclusive economic zone is a 200-nautical-mile (230-mile) zone in which maritime law grants a coastal country the sole right to natural resources.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing significantly harms global fish stocks, ecosystems, and the livelihoods of lawful fisherfolk. China, with the world's largest distant-water fishing fleet, plays a substantial role in this issue.
The joint patrol's 30 participating vessels and three aircraft waters were operating in the vicinity of Jeju Island from March 25-31, Korea JoongAng Daily reported.
The country's coast guard said that, on average, 300 Chinese vessels fish illegally in the country's exclusive waters each day, with that figure dropping to an estimated 140 during periods of intensified crackdowns.
One of the Chinese boats had prepared 31 large fishing nets, each one worth over $44,000, according to the maritime law enforcement agency. Patrol members destroyed 20 of these and planned to take possession of the others.
A Chinese vessel was also caught trespassing in waters near the de facto maritime boundary separating South Korea from the North.
The crew was found to have underreported their catches. They were also using a type of net banned in South Korea because it was specially designed to catch even young fish, depleting local stocks.
The Coast Guard issued a total of $333,000 in fines and arrested one of the boats' captains. Five of the Chinese nationals were later deported, according to the report.

""We will take strong measures against those who conduct illegal fishing activities, which ruin marine resources by sweeping up young fish,"" Korea JoongAng Daily quoted one Coast Guard official as saying.
The official pointed out that Seoul regularly discloses illegal fishing activities with international perpetrators' countries of origin during diplomatic talks and presses them to take preventative action.
Newsweek reached out to the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., and the Korea Oceanographic Data Center with written requests for comment.
Chinese fishing vessels are often linked to overfishing and resource exploitation in international waters and in the exclusive economic zones of other nations, challenging efforts to sustain marine populations and enforce regulations.
Last month, Chinese fishing boats suspected of breaking Vanuatu's fishing laws were boarded by officials of the South Pacific nation's fisheries agency, along with U.S. Coast Guard members who were patrolling with them under a capacity-building program known as Operation Pacific Blue.",2024-04-03T13:54:13Z,https://www.newsweek.com
"South Korea returns beloved panda, Fu Bao, back to China","A crowd of people, some weeping, gathered at a rain-soaked amusement park in South Korea to bid farewell to a beloved giant panda before her departure to China on Wednesday.
Fu Bao has been a major attraction at the Everland theme park near Seoul since she was born there in 2020 to pandas Ai Bao and Le Bao, who came from China in 2016 on a 15-year lease program.
China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and their cubs.
Decades of conservation efforts in the wild and study in captivity saved the species from extinction, increasing its population from fewer than 1,000 at one time to more than 1,800 in the wild and in captivity.

North Korea says it tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile that uses solid propellants,"North Korea said Wednesday it had tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, extending a run in weapons demonstrations that’s deepening a nuclear standoff with neighbors and the United States.
With the supposed success of the test, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his country had acquired the ability to build solid-fuel, nuclear-capable systems for missiles of all ranges as he pursues an arsenal that could viably threaten rivals in Asia and the United States.
The report by North Korean state media came a day after the South Korean and Japanese militaries detected the North launching a missile from near its capital toward its eastern sea.
North Korean state media said the test was supervised by Kim, who described the Hwasong-16B missile as a key piece of his nuclear war deterrent he vowed to further build up to counter his “enemies,” a reference to the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Kim said the North has now developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for “all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges,” the Korean Central News Agency said.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods of time.
North Korea last year tested a solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time, adding to its arsenal of long-range weapons targeting the U.S. mainland.
The country also has an extensive lineup of short-range and mid-range solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from land vehicles, ships and submarines and are potentially capable of reaching targets throughout South Korea and Japan. The North in recent months demonstrated some of these missiles in drills it described as simulated nuclear strikes while issuing provocative threats of nuclear conflict.
The North has since 2021 also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to exceed five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defense systems because of their speed and maneuverability. However, it’s unclear whether the North’s hypersonic vehicles consistently maintained a desired speed exceeding Mach 5 during tests in 2021 and 2022.",2024-04-03T08:56:35Z,https://www.nbcnews.com
North Korea Claims New Hypersonic Missile Milestone,"North Korea has said it successfully tested a new hypersonic missile powered by solid propellants, a day after South Korea and Japan detected a missile launched from Pyongyang toward the east.
The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) published photos on Wednesday of leader Kim Jong Un overseeing the launch of the Hwasong-16B, equipped with a hypersonic glide warhead. He said the new medium-to-long-range missile demonstrates the ""absolute superiority"" of Pyongyang's defense technology and is a key piece of his nuclear war deterrent.
In January, North Korea launched what it said was its first hypersonic missile, with the South saying it flew 620 miles before landing off the Korean Peninsula's east coast.
Hypersonic missiles are designed to fly at a speed of more than five times the speed of sound, and their warheads manoeuver mid-flight, making them difficult to track and intercept. Missiles powered with solid propellants do not need to be fuelled immediately ahead of launch. This makes them easier to launch at short notice, harder to detect and destroy, and more survivable than missiles that have a liquid-fuel system.
North Korea has now developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for ""all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges,"" Kim said after the test launch, KCNA reported.

The missile is ""another powerful strategic offensive weapon"" and Pyongyang has achieved its goal of developing missiles ""with various ranges on solid-fueled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis,"" the North Korean leader said.
It would give Pyongyang the capacity for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide,"" Kim added, likely referencing the United States, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea's military said the missile traveled about 600 kilometers (372 miles) before landing in waters of the East Sea between Japan and South Korea. KCNA offered different figures, saying it flew around 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), reaching a peak altitude of 101 kilometers (62 miles). However, South Korea has disputed this, saying the numbers were exaggerated.
KCNA also said had limited the missile's range ""in consideration of safety.""
""The test-fire had no adverse effect on the security of neighbouring countries,"" KCNA added.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Republic of Korea said in a statement that ""the flight distance claimed by North Korea (1,000 km) differs from our military's analysis and is evaluated as an exaggeration,"" adding, ""The results of the analysis by South Korea, the United States and Japan are over 600 km,"" Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency reported.",2024-04-03T08:30:23Z,https://www.newsweek.com
"Korea's YG Sets Yang Min-seok as CEO, Gives BabyMonster Official Debut","CHANGING TRACKS
YG Entertainment, the firm behind K-pop sensation Blackpink, has appointed Yang Min-seok as its new, sole CEO. The younger brother of company founder Yang Hyun-sun, he was previously joint CEO with Hwang Bo-kyun.
The announcement was made shortly after YG’s annual shareholder meeting that closed the books on a year in which revenues climbed 65% to $430 million.
The firm, which recently denied that it had paid $30 million to retain its position with Blackpink (but saw the girl group’s individual members sign personal representation contracts with other agencies) is busily launching BabyMonster, another all-female act that is seen in some circles as a successor to Blackpink.
BabyMonster, which was formed late last year through reality TV show “Last Evaluation 2023,” is a seven part group with members from Korea, Thailand and Japan. The group launched singles last year and in February. But YG is now describing mini-album and new single “Sheesh,” released on April 1, as the group’s official debut.
Watch trailer for “Sheesh” here:
With a strong reception to the new tracks, BabyMonster is already booked for a five-territory fan meeting tour to Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.

North Korea says it fired new intermediate-range hypersonic missile,"North Korea said Wednesday that it test-fired the Hwasongpho-16B, a new intermediate-range solid-fueled ballistic missile with a hypersonic gliding warhead. Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, April 3 (UPI) -- North Korea successfully test-fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile, state media reported Wednesday, adding another nuclear-capable weapon to its expanding arsenal. State-run Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch of the new missile, dubbed the Hwasongpho-16B, on Tuesday. Advertisement
The weapon is a ""new-type intermediate-range solid-fueled ballistic missile loaded with newly-developed hypersonic gliding warhead,"" KCNA said.
Kim praised the development of ""another powerful strategic offensive weapon""' and said that the North's entire arsenal of missiles was now ""on solid-fueled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis.""
The developments present growing challenges for missile detection and interception systems. Missiles using solid-fuel propellants can be transported and launched more quickly than liquid-fuel models, while hypersonic weapons travel at least five times the speed of sound and are maneuverable mid-flight.
A hypersonic missile was on a wish list of weapons that Kim laid out at a party congress in January 2021, alongside nuclear-powered submarines, submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, ""ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons"" and military satellites.
Intermediate-range missiles tipped with nuclear warheads could place U.S. military installations in Guam -- around 2,100 miles away -- within reach.

South Korea's military announced Tuesday that it had detected the launch, saying the missile flew around 375 miles and splashed down in the East Sea.
According to the KCNA report, the new missile's hypersonic glide warhead reached a peak height of 62 miles and flew about 620 miles while conducting maneuvers before hitting a target in the sea.
The launch was the North's third ballistic missile of the year among a range of weapons tests and heated rhetoric that has kept tensions ratcheted up on the Korean Peninsula. It comes amid growing military ties between North Korea and Russia, with evidence that Moscow is sharing advanced weapons technology and helping Pyongyang evade sanctions in exchange for munitions.
The United States, South Korea and Japan have increased their military cooperation in response to the North's provocations, with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets to the Peninsula.
On Tuesday, the three allies conducted a combined aerial exercise involving nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bombers hours after the North's missile launch.
The drills were held to ""improve our deterrence and response capabilities to North Korea's increasingly advanced nuclear and missile threats,"" South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a statement.",2024-04-03T03:11:49Z,https://www.upi.com

The defense ministry said in a statement that the planned 10-hour flight took place over the neutral waters of the Sea of Japan, which is bordered by the Japanese archipelago, the Russian island of Sakhalin, the Korean Peninsula, and the mainland of the Russian Far East.

Newsweek has contacted the Russian foreign ministry for comment.
The statement on Tuesday did not specify which airfield the test flight started and finished from or give details of where exactly over the body of water the route was. But social media users noted that such flights were usually a display of strength by Moscow.

This comes less than two weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a solid-fuel engine test for a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM).
Moscow's relations with North Korea have been strengthening, with Pyongyang providing Russia with extensive military packages, including ballistic missiles and over three million artillery shells, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said on Monday.
Russian Lieutenant General Sergey Kobylash, commander of long-range aviation said in a statement on the Russian defense ministry website that the flight ""was carried out in strict accordance with international rules for the use of airspace.""
""Long-range pilots regularly fly over the neutral waters of the Arctic, the North Atlantic, the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Pacific Ocean,"" he added.
In March 2023 two Russian Tu-95MS aircraft flew over the Sea of Japan for more than seven hours as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was beginning a visit to Ukraine.
Japan, a key U.S. ally which has joined global sanctions against Russia because of the war in Ukraine, has a territorial dispute with Moscow over the Kuril Islands in the north Pacific, which dates back to the end of World War II.

North Korea Wants To Put 'Several' Spy Satellites Into Orbit This Year,"North Korea plans to follow up last year's launch of a spy satellite by putting several more in orbit by the end of this year, according to state media.
Pyongyang plans to make itself a ""space power,"" putting it on the fast track to economic and scientific prowess, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) wrote Monday in a report marking the 11th anniversary of North Korea's space industry.
The reclusive country successfully launched its first surveillance satellite, Malligyong-1, last November. The U.S. condemned the action as a breach of the United Nations Security Council resolutions aimed at limiting dual-use technology that could advance the Kim Jong Un regime's ballistic missile program.
The launch also set into motion a North-South tit-for-tat that further raised the temperature on the Korean Peninsula.
The report cited National Aerospace Technology Administration Deputy Director General Pak Kyong So as saying Malligyong-1 represented the progress the ruling Workers' Party of Korea has made toward strengthening national defense as part of the party's policy of conquering space.
He added that ""several"" more reconnaissance satellites are planned for this year.
""The development of the space industry is of great importance in the construction of a powerful socialist country in which the leap forward is firmly guaranteed by cutting-edge science and technology,"" he was quoted as saying.
The North Korean embassy in China did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
Doubts remained about the functionality of Malligyong-1 until February, when Marco Langbroek, aerospace engineering professor at the Netherlands' Delft University, reported a satellite station at Leiden, the Netherlands, had observed the spacecraft executing perigee burns to rise to a higher orbit.
""One thing we have seen is that both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea missile and space programs very quickly learn from failures, and we are now seeing them getting more and more successful,"" Langbroek told Newsweek.
""I have just completed an additional analysis that shows that all these small maneuvers were done at moments that the satellite passed over North Korea, and all around 10-11 p.m. local time. So control seems to be done from North Korea itself (i.e. not outsourced to China or Russia), likely from Pyongyang's General Satellite Control Center.""
He added that it ""makes sense they are going to try to launch more and gain more experience with that.""

The KCNA article followed last week's statement by South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung-jun that the North was already laying the groundwork for a new satellite launch, though he added there was no indication the launch was imminent.
After two prior attempts believed to be failures, North Korea said it put Malligyong-1 into orbit on November 21, 2023, in what the White House called a ""brazen violation"" of United Nations Security Council sanctions. North Korea said the move was necessary for self-defense.
Seoul responded by partially suspending a landmark 2018 defense agreement meant to reduce the risk of military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, prompting Pyongyang to drop the pact entirely, further intensifying the diplomatic freeze between the North and South.
In December, South Korea launched its own first spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, leading the North to decry the U.S.'s ""double standard.""",2024-04-02T11:57:12Z,https://www.newsweek.com
Tottenham fury as Son Heung-min 'legend' claim brutally shut down by former Chelsea star,"Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min is not a Premier League legend, according to former Chelsea and Aston Villa midfielder Andy Townsend.
Son arrived in England in August 2015, when Tottenham signed him from Bayer Leverkusen. The left winger, who can also play as a centre-forward, has gone on to enjoy a fantastic career in North London.
Son has scored 160 goals and registered a further 82 assists in 399 appearances for Tottenham. This season, he has managed 15 goals and eight assists in 26 league matches and is Tottenham’s top goalscorer.
The South Korean currently sits fifth on the list of Spurs’ all-time record scorers, with only Martin Chivers, Bobby Smith, Sir Jimmy Greaves and Harry Kane netting more goals for the club.
While Son has been a fantastic servant to Spurs, both he and Kane have been let down by the fact the club has not managed to win any silverware since 2008.
While Son and Kane are modern-day icons at Spurs, their lack of trophies holds them back when it comes to ranking some of the best players in the world, and indeed of all time.

Townsend, who won two League Cups with Villa and also made 124 appearances for Chelsea, does not believe Son can be called a ‘legend’ in the Premier League.
When asked on talkSPORT if winning more trophies would help Son’s cause, Townsend replied: “He is a top player, he’s a great; that word ‘legend’ should only be used in the right context.”
Son Heung-min a Spurs ‘great’ but not a Prem ‘legend’
Townsend jokingly added: “Someone put that on your script about me earlier and it’s not right.
“I think that Son has been a great player and great operator for Spurs, but a legend? No.”
Son will be aiming to prove Townsend and his other doubters wrong by helping Spurs win a trophy under Ange Postecoglou.
While that will not happen this season, as Spurs were knocked out of both the FA Cup and League Cup, Son and Postecoglou will be hoping to end the club’s curse next term.
The team has improved hugely this campaign and if they can make some more clever signings this summer it will give them a good chance of finally lifting some silverware.
Spurs could also feature in a European competition next season, as they currently sit in fifth spot in the Premier League, three points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with a game in hand.

'Exhuma' Is Korea's Most Successful Film In Vietnam,"Korean horror film Exhuma has become the highest-grossing Korean film ever in Vietnam, its distributor Showbox Co said.
Exhuma has recorded more than 2.23 million moviegoers in Vietnam as of March 31, surpassing the previous mark of 2.15 million held by comedy film 6/45 (2022), which starred Go Kyung-pyo and Lee Yi-kyung.
Directed by Jang Jae-hyun, Exhuma stars Choi Min-sik, Kim Go-eun, Yoo Hae-jin and Lee Do-hyun. Exhuma recorded US$660,000 at the box office just on its first day of release in Vietnam, on March 15, which also set a new record for the highest opening gross, for a Korean film. On the film’s first weekend in the country, sales reached $3.02 million.
Exhuma has also become the most successful Korean film in Indonesia, notching 2.3 million admissions, which is a record for a Korean film in the country.
As of April 1, Exhuma has brought in more than 11 million admissions at the Korean box office and raked in $11.6M since its domestic release on February 22. It is the first Korean film to pass the 10 million admissions mark domestically this year.",2024-04-02T10:05:02Z,https://deadline.com
US urges South Korea to tighten chip export curbs on China,"The U.S. wants South Korea to further restrict the export of advanced semiconductor technology and tools used for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, Bloomberg News reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. has asked South Korea to adopt similar export restrictions on China as it has. The move is part of Washington's efforts to impede the advance of China's semiconductor industry over national security concerns.
The potential curbs are aimed at including logic chips more advanced than 14-nanometer and a type of memory known as DRAM beyond 18nm. This would be consistent with a set of restrictions the U.S. Department of Commerce first announced in 2022, the report added.
U.S. officials and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government had discussed the issues in March. The U.S. intends to reach an agreement before a G7 summit in mid-June, however, the Asian nation is mulling the idea because China remains an important trading partner, according to the report.
Earlier this month, the U.S., reportedly, was urging its allies including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan to further tighten the export of semiconductor equipment, spare parts and chip chemicals to China.
However, this timeline could be disturbed as officials from South Korea, Japan and the U.S. intend to meet in late June to discuss cooperation on advanced technology and supply chains.
Last week, the Biden administration further updated its rules, making it difficult for China to access U.S. AI chips and chipmaking equipment, as part of its efforts to impede the advance of China's semiconductor industry over national security concerns.
The move did not go unnoticed by China, as on Monday it criticized the move noting that the restrictions created additional obstacles to trade and more uncertainty in the chip industry.
South Korea is worried about potential penalties China may impose in response to the export controls, as several tech companies, including Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, still operate in China, Seoul's biggest trading partner, the report added.
With support from Samsung and Hynix, South Korea makes some of the world's most advanced logic and memory chips. However, the country's chip equipment suppliers are not as prominent as the U.S.-based Applied Materials (AMAT) or Dutch company ASML (ASML), local gear manufacturers including Hanmi Semiconductor and Jusung Engineering still make up a vital part of the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.
Meanwhile, Nvidia's (NVDA) partner SK Hynix intends to invest about $4B to set up an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, according to a report from last month. The project is expected to get tax incentives and other types of support in the U.S.
South Korea is eyeing a multinational framework to review export controls for sensitive products such as semiconductor-related equipment, the country's trade minister Cheong Inkyo had said last month. This could complicate U.S. efforts to curb China's influence on technology supply chains. However, it would take months for South Korea to implement any curbs, the official noted, according to the report.",2024-04-02T09:26:52Z,https://seekingalpha.com
'Hey Duggee's BBC Studios Launches Kids Streamer In Korea,"BBC Studios Launches First Kids Streamer In Korea
BBC Studios has launched a streamer for children’s TV in Korea for the first time. The BBC Kids platform will feature the likes of Hey Duggee, Andy’s Global Adventures and Go Jetters. It will be available as a monthly subscription service on Genie TV Kids Land, a Korean IPTV service for young children, in collaboration with KT. The service will feature a mix of content in English language as well as a variety of popular titles dubbed into Korean for the very first time. It comes as the BBC places more stress on exploiting commercial outside of the UK. BBC Studios recently bought out BritBox International from ITV. It already operates kids streamers in Australia, Taiwan, South Africa and India, along with a U.S. FAST channel. “The BBC has been educating, informing and entertaining the world for over 100 years and BBC Kids continues our commitment to fostering early childhood development through this engaging and enriching content designed specifically for children,” said Phil Hardman, SVP and General Manager, BBC Studios Asia.
Viaplay Ties With John De Mol‘s Talpa & Completes UK Biz Sale
Viaplay Group has entered into a linear partnership with John de Mol’s Talpa Network in the Netherlands and completed the sale of its UK business. Starting April 5, Talpa Network’s SBS9 linear TV channel will be rebranded as Viaplay TV, and will show selected content from the Viaplay streaming service’s portfolio of premium sports. Viaplay TV’s first live broadcast will be the second free practice session for the Japanese Grand Prix, featuring superstar Dutch driver Max Verstappen. In addition to selected live sports and reruns from Viaplay, Viaplay TV will feature Dutch and international series and films from Talpa Network’s entertainment offering. “Talpa Network is a well-established Dutch player with outstanding reach,” said Peter Nørrelund, Viaplay Group EVP and Chief Sports & Business Development Officer. “This partnership will showcase Viaplay’s premium sports portfolio, which is the most attractive and relevant anywhere in the Netherlands.” The move is reflective of Scandi outfit Viaplay’s new strategy to focus on core markets following an incredibly difficult 2023, during which around 30% of staffers were laid off. It comes as the sale of its UK business back to Premier Sports completes, having received final clearance from the Irish authorities. Last week, CEO Jørgen Madsen Lindemann vowed that the company will “be different” following huge 2023 losses, although turnover did increase. He said the “complexity of exiting” Viaplay’s non-core international markets was holding up several commercial deals and led to higher than expected losses.",2024-04-02T08:31:13Z,https://deadline.com

FREE FLOWN
Radio Free Asia, a U.S.-government funded broadcast and online news operation, has closed its editorial office in Hong Kong. The company said on Friday that it has shut down its bureau as a reaction to the new Article 23 National Security Law which came into effect on March 23. RFA will keep its media registration in the city.
The law, which is addition to the National Security Law injected into Hong Kong’s mini constitution in July 2020, imposes severe punishments for interference by foreign forces deemed to threaten national security and criminalizes the possession or disclosure of state secrets. These can include economic and social issues. It also criminalizes sedition.
The Hong Kong government has criticized RFA, the BBC and other news organizations for their reporting about the new law. It says that it was its constitutional duty to enact the new law, rejects claims that Article 23 restricts personal freedoms or is substantially different from security laws in other developed territories.

In the bond market, Treasury yields spurted higher after a report said U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly returned to growth last month. It snapped a 16-month run of contraction, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
It's the latest evidence showing the U.S. economy remains strong despite high interest rates. That's a positive for the stock market because it can drive growth in profits for companies. But it can also keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could mean a more hesitant Federal Reserve when it comes to the cuts to interest rates that investors crave.

Following the manufacturing data, traders on Wall Street briefly trimmed bets on the first cut to rates coming as soon as June. That's still a “reasonable baseline"" expectation, according to Deutsche Bank economists, but they say tough talk from Fed officials recently could hint at interest rates staying higher for longer than earlier thought.
The Fed has hiked its main rate to the highest level since 2001 in order to slow the economy and depress investment prices enough to get inflation under control. Expectations for coming cuts have been a major reason the S&P 500 soared more than 20% from October through March.

This week will offer several economic reports that could sway the Fed's thinking, including updates on job openings across the country and the strength of U.S. services businesses. The headliner arrives on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that hiring cooled a bit last month.
A slowdown would be welcome on Wall Street, where the hope is that the economy remains solid but not so strong that it pushes inflation higher. Inflation is milder than it was at its peak nearly two years ago. But progress has become bumpier recently, with reports this year coming in hotter than expected.

Seoul says Pyongyang launched ballistic missile towards Sea of Japan,"Near the US-Canada border in Burlington, Vermont, which is set to experience the totality just before 3:30 pm (1930 GMT), many hotels have been sold out for months.
The few remaining rooms, which typically go for around $150 a night, show online prices of $600-$700 for the night of the eclipse.
""I don't know that we'll have anything quite like this again,"" Jeff Lawson, a vice president in the chamber of commerce, told AFP.
Lawson marveled at his city's ""incredible luck"" at an opportunity ""quite literally falling out of the sky into your lap.""
If skies are clear, the small city of 40,000 could see its population double for the day, with visitors arriving by car, train and even private jet, Lawson said.
An estimated 32 million people live inside the ""path of totality"" -- under which the Moon will fully block out the Sun -- with an additional 150 million residing less than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from the strip, NASA says.
- Traffic jams -
Preparations for the big day began years ago, Matt Bruning of the Ohio Department of Transportation told AFP.
He said the agency reached out to counterparts along the last major US eclipse, in 2017, and ""one of the things that we heard resoundingly was it's never too early to start planning.""
Despite those efforts, there will inevitably ""be delays, there will be heavy congestion,"" he warned.
Businesses are leaping into the bonanza with special events and in Cleveland, where local officials expect some 200,000 visitors, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame plans a four-day ""Solarfest"" of live music.
The Perryman Group, a Texas-based research firm, estimates direct and indirect economic impacts of this year's eclipse could reach $6 billion.
This year's path of totality is about 115 miles wide, wider than in 2017. It begins in western Mexico, arches up through the US cities of Dallas, Indianapolis, and Buffalo, before ending in eastern Canada.
Many schools along the path will be closed or letting students out early, including in Cleveland and Montreal.
Several airlines have advertised flights scheduled to pass under the eclipse, while Delta has even planned two special trips along the path of totality, the first of which sold out in 24 hours, the company said.
NASA warns that only in the path of totality -- and only during the few minutes of the actual totality -- is it safe to look at the eclipse without eye protection.
- 'Cosmic coincidence' -
Almost all of the United States will get to experience a partial eclipse, but UCLA astronomer Jean-Luc Margot says the trip to see the totality is definitely worth the hassle.
""If you have a 99 percent partial eclipse, that is a completely different experience than being in the path of totality,"" he told AFP.
He will be accompanying a group of UCLA alumni to view the eclipse in rural Texas, after similar trips in 2017 to Oregon and to Chile in 2019.
When people finally see the eclipse, they ""tend to be emotional,"" Margot said.
""It is such a beautiful event. It's due to this complete cosmic coincidence, that the angular size of the Sun and the angular size of the Moon are about the same.""
Scientists have traditionally used the eclipses to observe the solar corona, an outer layer of plasma that's difficult to study due to the Sun's bright light, Margot said.
New tools such as the space-based Parker Solar Probe have made such research less eclipse-dependent, but scientists will still be taking full advantage.
NASA recently highlighted several studies being planned for the eclipse, from effects on Earth's atmosphere and animal behavior to even human psychology.
""Eclipses have a special power,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said recently.
""They move people to feel a kind of reverence for the beauty of our universe.""",2024-04-02T05:52:57Z,https://www.rawstory.com
Japan approves $3.9 billion in subsidies to domestic chip maker Rapidus,"Japan said Tuesday it has approved up to 590 billion yen ($3.89 billion) in additional subsidies for chipmaker Rapidus Corporation, as the country plays catch up with other nations on semiconductor manufacturing.
The latest round of support will include up to 53.5 billion yen for research and development of back-end processes such as chip packaging, according to a press briefing by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on Tuesday.
Rapidus Corporation was founded in 2022 by the Japanese government and eight domestic companies to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Toyota Motor Corporation, Sony Group are among the companies that have invested billions of yen in Rapidus.
Rapidus has received 330 billion yen from the Japanese government between 2022 and 2023 to mass produce 2-nanometer chips in Chitose, Hokkaido, from 2027.
It will compete with industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, which plan to start mass production of 2-nanometer chips by 2025.
TSMC and Samsung currently produce 3-nanometer chips, while Rapidus is currently constructing an advanced semiconductor plant in Chitose.
Typically, a reduction in nanometer size can yield more powerful and efficient chips with more transistors packed onto a single semiconductor.
Rapidus said in April 2023 its workers had begun research and development in collaboration with IBM.",2024-04-02T04:32:42Z,https://www.cnbc.com
"North Korea tests missile, Seoul says, ahead of vote seen as gauge of support for hardline South Korean leader","Seoul, South Korea CNN —
North Korea test-fired a presumed intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, its latest military maneuver since leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year declaration that he was ending a policy seeking reconciliation with the South.
Pyongyang made no immediate comment on the suspected test, which comes just over a week before key legislative elections in South Korea that will provide a barometer of support for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line against the North during his two years in office.
North Korea, which has faced years of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, has ramped up its weapons tests and military exercises in recent weeks.
On March 19, Pyongyang said it had tested a multistage, solid-fueled rocket engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Kim said after that test the development of the IRBM system was as important to North Korea’s security as its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which in theory could reach the United States mainland.
The KCNA report on the engine test did not give further details of the new hypersonic weapon, but North Korea has previously said it tested a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).
While all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic velocity – five to 10 times the speed of sound – in their terminal phase, an HGV can maneuver at high speeds as it nears a target, enabling it to evade detection and missile defenses.

Meanwhile, North Korea’s military has staged a series of military exercises in the past few months as the US and South Korea also held drills, including their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which South Korea said focused on deterring the North’s nuclear threat.
Pyongyang’s shows of power included long-range artillery and multiple rocket launchers, which pose a threat to the South Korean capital Seoul and other key areas near the border.
Ahead of the April 10 vote, some polls show President Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) widely trailing the opposition Democratic Party – and a loss for the PPP could be seen to weaken Yoon’s leadership, analysts say.
Yoon, who has pushed for increased military cooperation with the US, also backs closer ties with Korea’s former colonial ruler Japan, angering many in a country where the scars of that occupation remain prominent.
But Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Tuesday’s suspected missile test by North Korea won’t have much effect on the vote.

“Firing an intermediate-range missile lacks the shock value of a full-range ICBM launch or a nuclear test, so it’s unlikely to swing any National Assembly seats,” Easley said.
South Koreans are more focused on domestic problems like healthcare reform and economic troubles, Easley added.
Tuesday’s suspected North Korean missile test also comes less than two weeks before Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida heads to Washington for a trilateral summit with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
While the issue of an increasingly assertive China is expected to be front and center at that meeting, North Korea is also likely to be on the agenda for the three leaders.
North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui last week quashed recent speculation that Kishida could meet with North Korea’s Kim.
North Korea “will not allow any attempt of Japan to contact” Pyongyang, he said, according to KCNA.

"North Korea tests missile, Seoul says, ahead of vote seen as gauge of support for hardline South Korean leader","By Brad Lendon, CNN
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) — North Korea test-fired a presumed intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, its latest military maneuver since leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year declaration that he was ending a policy seeking reconciliation with the South.
Pyongyang made no immediate comment on the suspected test, which comes just over a week before key legislative elections in South Korea that will provide a barometer of support for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line against the North during his two years in office.
North Korea, which has faced years of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, has ramped up its weapons tests and military exercises in recent weeks.
On March 19, Pyongyang said it had tested a multistage, solid-fueled rocket engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Kim said after that test the development of the IRBM system was as important to North Korea’s security as its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which in theory could reach the United States mainland.
The KCNA report on the engine test did not give further details of the new hypersonic weapon, but North Korea has previously said it tested a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).
While all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic velocity – five to 10 times the speed of sound – in their terminal phase, an HGV can maneuver at high speeds as it nears a target, enabling it to evade detection and missile defenses.

U.S. pushes South Korea to follow its lead and tighten export controls on chips for China,"The US is asking South Korea to adopt restrictions on semiconductor technology exports to China similar to those Washington has already implemented, another sign the Biden administration is stepping up efforts to thwart Beijing’s chip ambitions.
American officials want South Korea to restrict the flow of equipment and technologies for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include logic chips more advanced than 14-nanometer and a type of memory called DRAM beyond 18nm, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. That would be consistent with a set of measures the US Department of Commerce first announced in 2022.
American officials discussed the issues in depth with the government of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in March, the people said. While the US is trying to reach an agreement before a G7 summit in mid-June, Seoul officials are debating whether to satisfy the US request, in part because China remains a key trading partner.
Washington’s request of South Korea has not been detailed before. This comes on top of the new US push to get allies to limit servicing of semiconductor equipment for Chinese firms and restrict exports of spare parts and chip chemicals to China.
Bloomberg News has reported the US pressed allies, including South Korea and Germany, to tighten curbs on China’s access to their technology. Korea plays a leading role in producing semiconductors and providing spare parts for chip-making equipment.
The timeline could slip. South Korea, Japan and US officials are planning to meet in late June to discuss cooperation on advanced technology and supply chains, according to the people.
South Korean officials are wary of potential penalties that export controls may trigger from Beijing when major firms such as Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. still operate in China, Seoul’s largest trading partner.
The US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security did not respond to requests for comment. South Korea’s Trade Ministry declined to comment.
With help from Samsung and Hynix, South Korea makes some of the world’s most advanced logic and memory chips. While its chip equipment suppliers are not as prominent as the US’s Applied Materials Inc. or the Netherlands’ ASML Holding NV, local gear makers including Hanmi Semiconductor Co. and Jusung Engineering Co. still make up an important part of the Asian country’s semiconductor ecosystem.
South Korea has the biggest market share of memory chips in China and it is the second largest provider of silicon wafers for Chinese firms after Japan, according to a February report from the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. For chip-making materials and parts, South Korea is also the second largest exporter to China after Japan, the report said.
Meanwhile, South Korea is tapping into a multinational framework to review export controls for sensitive products like semiconductor-related equipment, the country’s trade minister Cheong Inkyo told reporters last month, an approach that may complicate US efforts to curtail China’s influence on technology supply chains. It will take months for South Korea to implement any curbs, the official added.",2024-04-02T04:00:00Z,https://fortune.com
"North Korea fires an intermediate-range missile, South Korea says","SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast Tuesday, South Korea’s military said, as it pushes to advance its weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and flew about 372 miles before landing in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the launch most likely followed up on a North Korean test in March of a solid-fuel engine built for a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile it has been developing. If perfected, such weapons could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond, experts say.
Lee did not specify why the South Koreans were assessing the missile as an IRBM or whether it was flown at less than its capacity, but said the North Koreans were most likely experimenting with new warhead technologies.
Japan’s Defense Ministry gave more details in its assessment, saying the missile flew about 403 miles while reaching a maximum altitude of 62 miles before landing in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone. The Japanese military did not immediately say whether it assessed the missile as intermediate range or something else.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile had been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security.”
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
Following the March 19 test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods of time.
Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm his adversaries’ missile defense systems. Other weapons North Korea has tested this year include cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at Seoul, the capital of South Korea.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year. South Korea’s military said Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the northwest.
Kim has described satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military movements and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. Last November, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit for the first time.",2024-04-02T03:58:28Z,https://www.nbcnews.com

SEOUL, April 2 (UPI) -- North Korea launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile into the East Sea Tuesday, South Korea's military said, the latest in a slew of weapons tests by the isolated regime this year. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters that it detected a projectile presumed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile fired from the Pyongyang area at 6:53 a.m. Advertisement
The missile flew around 375 miles before splashing down in the East Sea, the JCS said.
""Our military immediately detected, tracked and monitored the launch of a North Korean missile and closely shared related information with the U.S. and Japan,"" the JCS said. ""Detailed specifications are being comprehensively analyzed.""
Hawaii-based U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said it was aware of the launch and was consulting with South Korea and Japan.
""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" the command said in a statement, using the official name of North Korea. ""While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation.""

The launch was the North's third ballistic missile of the year among a range of weapons tests and heated rhetoric that has kept tensions ratcheted up on the Korean Peninsula.
On March 20, Pyongyang announced that it successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for a new type of hypersonic missile, and South Korean defense officials said that Tuesday's launch may have been a trial of the new delivery system.
""We believe [the launch] is related to the solid-fuel ground test that North Korea publicly reported in March,"" JCS spokesman Col. Lee Sung-jun said at a press briefing.
Hypersonic weapons travel at least five times the speed of sound and are designed to be maneuverable, making them difficult to intercept. In January, Pyongyang said it test-fired a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with a hypersonic warhead, which could place U.S. military installations in Guam -- around 2,100 miles away -- within reach.
Lee said Tuesday's launch showed ""some similarities and some differences"" with the January test and added that further analysis was required.
""There is a possibility that the launch vehicle's capabilities have been enhanced,"" he said.
A hypersonic missile was among a wish list of weapons that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un laid out at a party congress in January 2021, alongside nuclear-powered submarines, submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, ""ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons"" and military satellites.

On Monday, a North Korean official announced that Pyongyang planned to place several spy satellites into orbit this year.
Tuesday's launch comes amid growing military ties between North Korea and Russia, with evidence that Moscow is sharing advanced weapons technology and helping Pyongyang evade sanctions in exchange for munitions. Russia last week used its veto power to end a U.N. Security Council group that monitors sanctions violations by the North.
It also comes about a week ahead of the April 10 general election in South Korea, which defense officials have said may be a target for further provocations from the North.
""Further analysis is needed for [another intermediate-range ballistic missile] launch in the run-up to the general election,"" Lee said. ""There is also a possibility of additional missile launches and the launch of a space launch vehicle from [satellite facility] Tongchang-ri in the future, and we are keeping a close eye on it.

South Korea's president vows not to back down in the face of doctors' strike,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s president vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts “an illegal collective action” that poses “a grave threat to our society.”
About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks, causing hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools have also submitted resignations though they haven’t stopped treating patients.
Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes.
Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors. But observers say many people are increasingly fed up with the protracted confrontation between the government and doctors, threatening to deal a blow to governing party candidates ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections.
In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea’s doctor-to-patient ratio — 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people — is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world.
“Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can’t further delay,” Yoon said.

Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people’s lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains why adding 2,000 more students is too steep of an increase.
“I can’t tolerate an attempt to carry through their thoughts by force without due logic and grounds,” Yoon said. “The illegal collective action by some doctors has become a grave threat to our society.”
Yoon said the recruitment plan won’t lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world.
Yoon’s speech is expected to draw an angry response from doctors, who have maintained they can have serious talks only when the government drops its increased enrollment plan. They deny opposing the plan over worries about future incomes.
Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn’t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.
Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of governing party leader Han Dong-hoon.
The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors in South Korea — estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors’ association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30% to 40% of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training.
Doctors say the government enrollment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also most likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-04-01T10:06:59Z,https://www.nbcnews.com

Later Monday, the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, criticized Yoon for repeating what his government has already argued to support the recruitment plan.
“It was an address that brought us greater disappointment because we had high hopes” for some changes in the government’s position, Kim Sung-geun, a spokesperson for KMA’s emergency committee, told reporters.
Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn’t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.
Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon.
It’s unclear if the government and doctors can find a breakthrough to settle their standoff anytime soon. Last week, KMA elected Lim Hyun-taek, a hardliner who has called for a decrease in the medical school admission cap, as its new chief.
After his election Tuesday, Lim said that doctors can sit down for talks with the government if Yoon apologizes and dismisses top health officials involved in the recruitment plan. Lim also threatened to launch an all-out fight if any doctors receive punitive steps over their recent protests.

SEOUL, April 1 (UPI) -- North Korea said Monday it was on its way to becoming a ""space power"" and vowed to put several more reconnaissance satellites into orbit this year, following its first successful launch in November. ""Great progress has been made in strengthening the national defense capability with the successful launch of the reconnaissance satellite 'Malligyong-1' last year,"" Pak Kyong Su, vice director of the North's National Aerospace Technology Administration said, according to state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""Several reconnaissance satellites are expected to be launched this year as well."" Advertisement
Pak made the comments on the anniversary of the founding of the North's space development agency on April 1.
North Korea has also been working on satellite projects for sectors including agriculture, weather observation, communications, land management and disaster prevention, Pak added.
""The development of the space industry is a key factor in opening up a shortcut to securing the status of a world-class economic, scientific and technological power,"" he said. ""We will surely build a space power by continuing to spur independent space development.""
North Korea successfully placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit last November after a pair of failed attempts earlier in the year.

That launch drew scrutiny amid Pyongyang's growing military ties with Moscow following a September visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Russia. The trip included a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a space launch facility.
Seoul and Washington say that Pyongyang has been shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
South Korea's Unification Ministry, which manages inter-Korean affairs, said Monday that Seoul is monitoring launch sites and key facilities in close coordination with the United States.
""We will not make any predictions about the possibility of launching a military satellite in the future, but will prepare for all possibilities through close cooperation with relevant organizations,"" ministry spokesperson Koo Byung-sam said at a press briefing.
""Regardless of the purpose of the satellites that North Korea claims, any North Korean satellite using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" he added.
South Korea's military said Monday that it detected no signs of preparations for an impending launch.

In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea's doctor-to-patient ratio — 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people — is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world.
“Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can't further delay,” Yoon said.
Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people's lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains their calls for a much smaller increase in the medical school enrollment quota.
“I can't tolerate an attempt to carry through their thoughts by force without due logic and grounds,” Yoon said. “The illegal collective action by some doctors has become a grave threat to our society.”
Yoon said the recruitment plan won't lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world.
Later Monday, the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, criticized Yoon for repeating what his government has already argued to support the recruitment plan.
""It was an address that brought us greater disappointment because we had high hopes” for some changes in the government's position, Kim Sung-geun, a spokesperson for KMA’s emergency committee, told reporters.
Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn't want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.
Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon.
It's unclear if the government and doctors can find a breakthrough to settle their standoff anytime soon. Last week, KMA elected Lim Hyun-taek, a hardliner who has called for a decrease in the medical school admission cap, as its new chief.
After his election Tuesday, Lim said that doctors can sit down for talks with the government if Yoon apologizes and dismisses top health officials involved in the recruitment plan. Lim also threatened to launch an all-out fight if any doctors receive punitive steps over their recent protests.
The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors in South Korea — estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors' association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30% to 40% of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training.
Doctors say the government enrollment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-04-01T05:49:51Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com
