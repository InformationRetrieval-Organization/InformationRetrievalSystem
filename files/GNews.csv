From the frying pan to the fire: green onions ignite voter anger in South Korea’s elections,"Yoon Suk Yeol is hardly the first elected politician to appear out of touch with ordinary voters during a cost-of-living crisis. But as South Korea prepares for key national assembly elections on Wednesday, its conservative president has been tripped up by a humble vegetable.
In recent weeks, green onions have gone from a simple staple of Korean cooking to a powerful symbol of voter anger over rising prices in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.
Its ascent from the kitchen into politics came during Yoon’s recent visit to a supermarket in Seoul that was intended to portray him as someone who understands the financial pressures faced by ordinary families.
Yoon said he had been to many markets and described as “reasonable” the store’s 875 won (51p) price tag for a bundle of green onions.

Observers were quick to point out, however, that the items had been only temporarily discounted thanks to government subsidies, while the supermarket had made a further price cut. The actual retail price is three to four times higher, hovering at 3,000-4,000 won in recent weeks.
Yoon’s People Power party is hoping to take control of the 300-seat assembly from a liberal majority led by the opposition Democratic party but the trip to the shops has added to criticism that Yoon appears aloof.
It has fuelled a surge in support for smaller parties that could upset the balance of power and render Yoon a lame-duck leader just two years into his presidency. His party has already been grappling with low approval ratings before the vote, which is being seen as a midterm referendum on Yoon’s administration.
Dining out on onion memes
It is not just the price of green onions that has seen significant rises. The price of agricultural products in March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The price of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.

Nevertheless, opposition candidates have used green onions as props during campaign speeches to draw attention to Yoon’s hapless attempt to court the average man and woman on the Seoul omnibus.
Social media was awash with onion memes, with some users posting photographs of green onions outside polling stations after the National Election Commission banned green onions from the locations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”.
“While people’s expression of political views should be respected to the maximum level, using a certain item as a means of expression other than for their original purpose has great potential to affect the election,” the commission said.
Hyun Jung, 36, said she hadn’t initially thought about the green onion issue, “but after I heard about the ban, I bought a green onion hairband and I’m determined to wear it on election day”.
If Yoon’s party fails to win more seats and take control of the assembly, Yoon risks seeing out the remaining three years of his term struggling to pass his policy agenda.
“If the People Power party is still a minority party after the general election … cooperation with the National Assembly will be very difficult,” Kang Joo-hyun, a professor of political science and international relations at Sookmyung Women’s University, told Agence France-Presse. “The president will become a lame duck quickly and … the power of state affairs will be greatly reduced.”
In a Gallup survey on 31 March, the opposition Democratic party, led by Lee Jae-myung, was polling slightly ahead of Yoon’s party – 37% to 35%.
The opposition parties are framing the votes as “judgment day”, suggesting that it is not just about choosing political candidates but also an opportunity for the public to send a strong message to the government over its handling of the economy.
Yoon, whose scandal-hit wife has been conspicuously absent from the campaign, is battling low approval ratings. His popularity did, though, gain momentum after he announced an increase in medical school trainees. The move was criticised by thousands of trainee doctors who have been on strike since February but voters who are worried about the country’s ability to care for its fast-ageing population have supported the move.
A four-week-old potential kingmaker
Disaffection with the political establishment has given smaller parties a rare opportunity to gain ground, including the Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk.
On the eve of the election Cho, whose party is competing only for the 46 seats contested through proportional representation, was polling neck-and-neck with the ruling party, despite being launched only four weeks ago, and is forecast to win between 10 and 15 seats.

Securing about 15 seats would enable Cho’s party to potentially form a coalition that could prevent the People Power party from regaining control of the assembly.
“If the opposition parties gain a significant number of seats … Yoon regime’s system will be shaken, and cracks will appear,” said Cho.
“The People Power party will be divided. The president will become a lame duck, and then a dead duck,” said Cho, who was forced to abandon his presidential ambitions by the 2019 scandal.
Suh Pureunhaneul, a restaurant employee in Seoul, summed up popular disaffection with the established parties, especially over the prohibitive cost of housing in the capital.
“It feels like they’re just promoting measures to maintain land prices rather than addressing what I really need,” he said. “Looking at the election, it feels like there’s no one I want to vote for. I wonder if voting would even make a difference.”",2024-04-09T04:55:28Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"US envoy to UN to visit Korean border, North Korean defectors","The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will travel to the heavily armed Korean border and meet North Korean defectors in South Korea, her office said on Monday, amid faltering U.N. efforts to ensure sanctions enforcement against the North.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's trip, set for April 14-20, came after Russia rejected the annual renewal of the multinational panel of experts which has over the past 15 years worked on the implementation of U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo criticised Moscow's veto and China's abstention, which experts said would undermine the sanctions enforcement, with a South Korean envoy likening it to ""destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed.""
Thomas-Greenfield's trip, which will also include a stop in Japan, was meant to advance bilateral and trilateral cooperation on the sanctions and beyond, U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson Nate Evans said. Both South Korea and Japan are currently members of the Security Council.
""In both countries, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield will discuss next steps to ensure a continuation of independent and accurate reporting of the DPRK's ongoing weapons proliferation and sanctions evasion activities,"" Evans said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In South Korea, Thomas-Greenfield will travel to the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas, meet young North Korean defectors as well as students at Ewha Womans University, Evans said.
In Japan, she will also meet family members of Japanese citizens who were abducted in the early 2000s by North Korea, and visit Nagasaki, which was hit by U.S. nuclear bombing in 1945.

Deaths From Doctor Shortage Fuel Election Angst in Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- In March 2023, a 17-year-old girl who fell from a building in the South Korean city of Daegu died after her ambulance was turned away by three hospitals that lacked doctors to treat her.
She was among more than 3,750 patients who have died since 2017 after local hospitals refused to provide care, according to a report by Cheong Yooseok, a professor of medical science at Dankook University in Cheonan city.
The startling statistic from one of Asia’s richest countries has become a major issue in the parliamentary elections taking place on April 10. While the country won acclaim for its low fatality rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus now is on inefficiency, waste and skewed economic incentives in the health-care system.
Renowned medical centers in Seoul are overwhelmed by patients, while the rest of the country struggles with a lack of physicians. A six-week-and-counting national walk-out by nearly 13,000 residents and interns protesting a plan to boost medical school enrollment has exacerbated the situation.
Seung-Pyo Jung, an esophageal cancer patient who lives on Jeju Island in south, flew to Seoul National University Bandung Hospital for surgery last June. While he’s supposed to have checkups every four weeks, sometimes it takes several months to get an appointment.
“There’s no doctor at all on this island who can treat esophageal cancer,"" Jung said of his hometown, which has a population of almost 700,000 people. “Everything is so concentrated in Seoul.""
The Korean Emergency Medical Association, which advocates for doctors working at emergency centers, warned that it may join the protest. Meanwhile, the health ministry said it’s willing to discuss the Korean Medical Association’s efforts to delay the plan to increase medical school enrollment if the group has a scientific, rational and unified proposal.
Health Care Collapse
Korea has among the fewest doctors per capita of all developed countries and hasn’t increased the number of medical students in more than two decades, said Gaetan Lafortune, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Demographic factors like the rapidly aging population will exacerbate the scarcity, he said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed to address the crisis. He proposed measures, like increasing the number of doctors, that have drawn complaints for being “populist moves"" ahead of the election to select the 300 member National Assembly.
While his conservative People Power Party is currently in power, he’s trying to flip dozens of seats held by his progressive rivals, led by the Democratic Party, to take control of the national legislature.
The health-care system is “collapsing,"" Yoon said at a public hearing in February. “Now is the golden time to push reforms.""
Yet the doctors themselves oppose efforts to expand physician supply, arguing that the government’s proposal to increase medical school enrollment by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058 doesn’t address the root problem.
This, they say, is that doctor pay in some critical fields covered by the country’s National Health Insurance system is far lower than that for outside specialists, especially those who do cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. The disparity in compensation and infrastructure between Seoul and rural areas also means a dearth of medical workers outside the capital.

Disappearing Doctors
“Doctors are disappearing at emergency centers, surgery rooms, delivery rooms, and hospitals in smaller cities,"" said Cheong, from Dankook University, in a December report. “Many young doctors gave up becoming fellows at medical colleges and work in the beauty industry.""
Cosmetic surgery has aggressively taken hold and medical tourism is booming in South Korea. More than 8 million foreign patients arrived between 2009 and 2022, many for the beauty industry that offers ubiquitous access to plastic surgery, Botox for $6 per shot, and laser skin tightening.
Meanwhile, essential fields including pediatrics have been hard hit. Only 53 residents applied to fill 205 pediatric slots for this year, and just eight were outside Seoul and its surroundings, according to the health ministry. For pediatric surgery, two trainee doctors applied for spots outside of the greater Seoul area.
In June 2023, the Korean Pediatric Society held a conference titled “How to Exit Pediatrics"" focused on learning about other disciplines including cosmetic surgery. The seminar was done at the behest of members who said the country’s ultra-low birth rate made it difficult to run pediatric clinics, officials said in a television interview with Channel A.
Outside Seoul
The situation is dire in most parts of the country.
More than half of Korea’s 114,000 doctors and dentists worked in Seoul or Gyeonggi province in 2022, according to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.
Hiring doctors outside the capital is tough, said Cho Seung-yeon, president of Incheon Medical Center. He couldn’t find anyone to lead the dialysis division for two years. Another public hospital offered $1 million for a cardiologist, he said.
Salaried doctors at private clinics can earn in excess of $300,000 annually, while those on their own make even more, he said. Cho offers $200,000 a year for physicians at his public hospital in Incheon, but he said few ultimately come.
Even in Seoul, medical care can be tenuous given the doctor shortage.
Kim Sung Ju, a 62-year-old who underwent surgery for esophageal cancer a decade ago, undergoes a battery of tests and waits hours for a brief visit with his doctor at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital in Gangnam, an upscale neighborhood in the city’s southeast, every three months.
“I really don’t understand why I have to visit this big hospital every three months, because I only get to talk to my doctor for three minutes,"" he said. “I had thought Korea’s health insurance system, with private doctors and national health insurance, was the world’s best, but now it’s becoming the world’s worst.""
A more robust medical work force is also essential to the country’s public health, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which has just 20 doctors out of 500 employees.
“We hope just two doctors join us a year,"" said Hong Jeong-ik, director-general of the bureau of public health emergency preparedness. “They can do something meaningful for the public, even if that may not help them make huge a profit.""
Amid the national debate, wait times for care have worsened since the doctors’ walkout to protest Yoon’s proposed reforms. The president says he won’t back down on what he calls a “minimum requirement"" for fixing the underlying issues. Nearly four-in-five Koreans support the expansion, polling ahead of the election shows.
“A nurse died in August 2022 at the one of Korea’s best hospitals, where she worked, because there was no doctor to treat her,"" Health and Welfare Minister Cho KyooHong said in an interview. “This is not right.""

Biden’s Envoy to the UN Set to Visit Border With North Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- The US ambassador to the United Nations will travel to the North Korean border as the Biden administration looks to reaffirm support for Asian allies and draw attention to a breakdown in Security Council unity over efforts to rein in Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will become the most senior US official to visit the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas since Vice President Kamala Harris went there in 2022. US mission spokesman Nate Evans said it’s part of a bigger week-long trip to South Korea and Japan, both of which are current members of the Security Council.
While the trip has been planned for some time, Thomas-Greenfield heads to the region soon after Russia vetoed a US-led Security Council resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of experts that has monitored North Korea’s nuclear-weapons development for 15 years. She’ll also be in Washington DC this week for a US summit with the leaders of Japan and the Philippines.
Such extensions were once routine but have run up against growing divisions in the council between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine and what the US says is Moscow’s push to secure weapons and ammunition from Pyongyang. North Korea also continues to make progress on its nuclear program in defiance of numerous Security Council resolutions.
Thomas-Greenfield will be briefed by military officials at the demilitarized zone. She also plans to meet civilians, including North Korean defectors, during her trip to South Korea, Evans said.
Thomas-Greenfield will also head to Japan, where she will meet officials to discuss shared priorities at the UN. She’ll also hear from family members of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Un’s regime.
(Updates with ambassador traveling to DC for summit in third paragraph. A previous version of this story corrected to say the US envoy will meet defectors during her South Korea visit, not at the DMZ.)

"China might use AI to disrupt the forthcoming US election, says Microsoft","What you need to know
Microsoft has published a report highlighting how China is leveraging AI to disrupt elections across South Korea, India, and the US.
The tech giant details that China's threat to the electoral process ""remains low"" but warns it could get severe with time as its deceitful ploys become more sophisticated.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had previously indicated that there's enough power to protect the integrity of the US presidential election, alongside the company's plan to empower voters with authoritative news regarding the election via Bing.
With the prevalence of generative AI and chatbots, misinformation is becoming more widespread. Microsoft recently shared a new report highlighting how China is misappropriating the tech, spanning from AI-generated memes designed to fuel outrage over Japan's disposal of nuclear wastewater to spreading malicious rumors indicating that the US government is behind the tragic wildfire in Hawaii and Kentucky's train derailment.
According to the tech giant:
""As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections.""
Further in the report, Microsoft indicated that it anticipates China will leverage AI-based ploys to interfere with high-profile elections this year. Several social media accounts believed to belong to Chinese users have been spotted spreading politically concocted AI-generated information. Moreover, the accounts would ask followers to interact with the posts by asking which presidential candidate they are supporting.
Microsoft speculates that China intends to use its position and AI to brew more chaos, ultimately allowing it to benefit from the high-profile elections. While the tech giant indicates the issue isn't severe, it warns the situation is highly likely to change:
""While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line.""
Microsoft's report complements the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's threat assessment of China. Both reports mentioned Storm-1376, a Beijing-based group known as ""Spamouflage"" that is believed to be behind Taiwan's electoral process disruptions via AI-generated content.

What's Microsoft doing to prevent the issue from becoming widespread?
(Image credit: Daniel Rubino | Bing Image Creator)
Last year, Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) was spotted misleading voters and users with false information regarding the forthcoming US election. Researchers indicated that the issue was systemic, after establishing a pattern. The chatbot had also been spotted providing false information about the election process in Germany and Switzerland.
But Microsoft has been putting elaborate measures and ramping up it efforts to prevent this situation from spiraling out of control. Earlier this year while in speaking in an interview, Microsoft CEO indicated there's 'enough technology' to protect the US presidential election from AI deepfakes and misinformation.
Microsoft had already indicated that it plans to empower voters with authoritative and factual election news on Bing ahead of the poll. Bing growth continues to stagnate despite Microsoft's hefty investment in AI, while Google dominates the search landscape.",2024-04-08T16:53:16Z,https://www.windowscentral.com,Windows Central

（中央社首爾8日綜合外電報導）韓國業界人士今天透露，中國電商巨擘「拼多多」旗下跨境平台Temu因涉廣告不實和不公平商業行為，正遭韓國公平交易委員會（Korea Fair Trade Commission，KFTC）調查。
韓聯社報導，Temu於今年2月成立韓國分公司Whaleco Korea LLC，並在當地大舉搶攻市場。但由於該公司尚未正式開始運作，目前公平會的調查仍以書面形式為限。
據悉，調查旨在確認Temu是否違反「電子商務交易法」規定的消費者保護義務，以及「標示廣告公正化法」有關不實或誇大廣告的條款。
自去年7月進軍韓國以來，Temu透過發放折價券等方式吸引新會員，並因採用類似賭博的輪盤遊戲及直銷手段而引發爭議。與此同時，該平台的出貨延遲和商品品質不佳等問題也讓不少消費者不滿。
阿里巴巴旗下的全球速賣通（AliExpress）和Temu先後遭韓國當局調查後，有人認為公平會可能將調查範圍擴及所有中國電商平台。公平會則表示，不便針對調查中的案件透露資訊，但若發現違法行為將從嚴處罰。

South Korea says second spy satellite placed in orbit,"As it stands now, polls have Trump and Biden effectively tied, meaning that there’s an opportunity, some might call it a moral imperative, to sway the country away from the dystopian future in which Trump triumphs.
But how exactly do we change voters’ minds?
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
One might believe it’s just a matter of making a persuasive argument, loaded with empirical facts and sound logic, articulated with perfect clarity. This is what the left-wing media often believes, and we have seen how successful that strategy has been — Donald Trump is as influential as ever.
But what if I told you that our neural wiring determines whether we have the ability to change our minds? What if I told you that science suggests conservatives, who are extremely likely to be voting for Trump this election, generally have more rigid cognitive systems, which means they are less adaptable, and therefore, less likely to adopt a new framework or perspective when their approach fails?
A seminal study by social psychologist David Amodio and colleagues at New York University suggests that the typical conservative is not likely to be convinced by something as simple as a logically persuasive argument. For some conservatives, it's like asking them to change the color of their eyes. A progressive worldview cannot pierce their psyche because being dogmatic is programmed into the fabric of that worldview. It is not just that they are “stubborn”; their brains are actually wired to resist things that are new and different. So, you could say they lack “free will” when it comes to their voting decision. When we speak of free will in a modern sense, we are talking about the personal agency that enables one to override ingrained biases and consider alternative perspectives.
To understand the implications of this study, we must voyage into the realm of neuroscience, where secrets of the mind await discovery. The ERN, which stands for “error related negativity,” is a spike in brain activity that is triggered when we commit an error. It serves as a kind of internal alert system within our brain, signaling when a mistake has been made. It emerges in the brain region known as the anterior cingulate cortex, which helps us navigate situations where established patterns or behaviors are ineffective and require adjustment. For example, if a person is learning to play a musical instrument and hits a wrong note, the ERN might spike, prompting them to correct their finger positioning and playing style. Over time, as they practice and adapt, the frequency of these ERN spikes will decrease, indicating improved proficiency and fewer mistakes.
RELATED: This complete psychological analysis reveals 14 key traits that explain Trump supporters
Armed with a knowledge of the nature of the ERN, Dr. Amodio and colleagues ventured into the terrain of politics. Their highly-cited 2007 study revealed an illuminating connection between one's political orientation and the intensity of the ERN response. What they found was that participants with liberal views exhibited a more pronounced ERN. This suggests they have a heightened sensitivity to error signals, indicating a cognitive system that acknowledges the need for adjustments in perspective and strategy. Essentially, when their established behavioral patterns were shown to be incorrect or suboptimal, their brains signaled more intensely for an adaptive response. From these findings, we can conclude that progressive-minded individuals possess a neural predisposition for recognizing the need for change and growth.
Conservatives, on the other hand, exhibited a smaller ERN. This suggests that their cognitive system is more resistant to signals advocating for change or reconsideration. We can think of this as a neural reflection of their preference for stability, tradition and consistency. The typical conservative voter’s mental landscape, sculpted by a combination of genetics and indoctrinating experiences, values the familiar and reliable. Established norms and long-held beliefs provide a safe harbor in the face of a changing society and an uncertain future. It's a mindset where radical shifts or sudden upheavals are perceived not as opportunities but threats to a delicate equilibrium. Conservatism is essentially a neurocognitive inclination aimed at preserving the status quo.
So, what are we supposed to take away from these results? Does it mean there’s no hope for shifting anyone’s stances this election?
One might reasonably conclude that we should simply focus on getting all those already on our ideological side to turn out to the polls on voting day.
But using that strategy alone is risky. We should not give up hope in spreading a progressive worldview, because resistance to change and evolution eventually leads to societal collapse. History has unequivocally demonstrated that. Adaptivity is the key to individual and collective survival. This means we have an ethical obligation to be evangelists for progress and sensible change. This will require a bit of social engineering and some creativity.
Persuading the conservatives intending to vote for Trump is not about convincing them with logic; it is about understanding and navigating their innate preference for stability and tradition. By recognizing the inherent gravitation toward consistency, we see that the presentation of facts or data might not be the most persuasive tool. Effective persuasion demands an approach that's strategically empathetic. Rather than challenging the core of their beliefs head-on, it’s far more effective to frame arguments in a way that resonates with their intrinsic values — stability, tradition and consistency. Narratives and stories that weave in those facts that resonate with their core values will be more compelling. Presenting change not as a rupture, but as a natural evolution of the existing order, can be a more palatable and effective narrative.
To truly sway Republican voters, we must employ more than just arguments. It demands a properly balanced mix of genuine empathy, clever communication strategy and a basic grasp of the neurocognitive biases shaping their perspectives.
In the end, the outcome of the election may well hinge on our ability to navigate the cognitive labyrinth of the conservative mind.

South Korea launches its second military spy satellite,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea has successfully launched its second military spy satellite into orbit, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year — North Korea in November and South Korea in December — amid heightened animosities. They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.
South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the satellite entered orbit and communicated with an overseas ground station after separation from a rocket.
“With the success of the second military spy satellite launch, our military has acquired an additional independent surveillance ability and further bolstered our ‘kill chain’ capability,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha Gyu told reporters, referring to the military’s preemptive missile strike capability.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025. South Korea’s first spy satellite launch on Dec. 1 was made from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base.
South Korea in 2022 became the world’s 10th nation to successfully launch a satellite with its own technology by using a homegrown rocket to place what it called a “performance observation satellite” in orbit. But experts say it’s economical to use a SpaceX rocket to launch spy satellite and that South Korea needs more launches to ensure the reliability of a rocket.
North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik said Monday that North Korea will likely go ahead with its second spy satellite launch soon to mark the April 15 birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Shin said it’s still possible for the North to perform the launch later due to technical reasons.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response.

SEOUL, April 8 (UPI) -- South Korea successfully placed its second military reconnaissance satellite into orbit, Seoul's military said Monday, a move that will heighten surveillance capabilities against North Korea amid a growing space race on the peninsula. The launch took place on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which was Monday morning in Seoul, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a press release. Advertisement
The satellite was carried on a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and successfully entered orbit around 45 minutes after launch. It later succeeded in communicating with a ground station, the ministry said.
In addition to increased surveillance capacity, the satellite will enhance South Korea's ""Kill Chain"" system, the ministry added. The Kill Chain is part of a three-pronged deterrence strategy that calls for preemptive strikes against the North's missiles -- and possibly its leadership -- in the event of a potential attack.
Monday's launch marked the second of five military reconnaissance satellites that Seoul has contracted with SpaceX to place into orbit by 2025. South Korea launched its first satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Dec. 1, less than two weeks after North Korea placed its own inaugural spy satellite into orbit.

The new satellite is equipped with synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, which can capture images at night and under any weather conditions, defense officials said.
""With the success of this launch, our military has further strengthened its space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,"" South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said after viewing a live stream of the launch at ministry headquarters. ""Now, even in bad weather, it has become possible to monitor the whole of North Korea clearly and precisely.""
North Korea announced plans last week to launch several more spy satellites of its own this year, amid concerns over its growing military relationship with Russia.
Washington and its allies say that Pyongyang is shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
Shin said that the South's satellite technology is far superior to that of the North and promised that upcoming launches will further widen the gap in the space race.
""By next year, we plan to launch a follow-up military reconnaissance satellite and an ultra-small satellite that is currently under development,"" he said. ""We will have an overwhelming intelligence superiority that cannot be compared with North Korea.""",2024-04-08T06:06:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

South Korea has launched its second military spy satellite into space, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year – North Korea in November and South Korea in December – amid heightened animosities. They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.
South Korea’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that the satellite was successfully separated from a rocket. It said it will check whether the satellite functions properly via its communications with an overseas ground station.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025. South Korea’s first spy satellite launch on Dec. 1 was made from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base.
South Korea in 2022 became the world’s 10th nation to successfully launch a satellite with its own technology by using a homegrown rocket to place what it called a “performance observation satellite” in orbit. But experts say it’s economical to use a SpaceX rocket to launch spy satellite and that South Korea needs more launches to ensure the reliability of a rocket.
North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response. Experts say North Korea likely believes that an enlarged weapons arsenals would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.",2024-04-08T03:46:01Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail
Japan’s pivot away from peace reflects new world order,"In 2022, Japan announced its biggest military build-up since World War II with an ambitious five-year spending plan that included buying missiles capable of striking China. Japan is earmarking a record ¥7.7 trillion ($77 billion) for its defence budget in fiscal 2024 in what local media are calling an “intense arms buildup”. The government wants to expand its annual defence budget to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027, from just 1 per cent now.
Reimagining its security alliances in an increasingly hostile region is the next logical step in Japan’s defence push.

To this end, Japan is poised to be included in the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine alliance with Australia, the US and the United Kingdom, a widely flagged idea likely to be formalised when Kishida meets President Joe Biden in Washington this week.
There is some irony in this, given Australia dumped Japan in 2016 in favour of France to build its new submarine fleet. However, Japan’s inclusion will be limited to the Pillar II elements of the alliance covering military technology. It will have nothing to do with the nuclear-powered submarine element of the pact.
It also cements a shift in the way Japan wants to manage its other alliances in the region.

Japan sees Australia as a key partner and no longer wants to solely rely on the US as its key protector. It is also boosting defence ties with South Korea despite the countries’ historical grievances.
A key driver for the flurry of activity is a sense that time is running out for both leaders.
Kishida’s popularity ratings are in the toilet, and he is unlikely to be around in a year, while the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House in November leaves a question mark over US-Japan defence ties.
Talk of welcoming Japan into an alliance that many in Tokyo joke should be renamed JAUKUS has been around since the alliance was first announced in 2021. Japan’s former prime minister Taro Aso advocated the move in a speech in Canberra late last year.
Strategically, Japan’s role as a partner in aspects of AUKUS covering military technology makes sense given its advanced manufacturing and defence capabilities.
“Japan has a lot to contribute in certain areas: space technologies and missile
technologies, anti-submarine and undersea surveillance technologies, hypersonics, [and] submarine technology just to name a few, and it’s advanced manufacturing is world-class,” says Grant Newsham, a senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies.

“And don’t forget that Japan has got a lot of money to invest in all this. It’s not as if the British and the Australians are rolling in dough they can invest in defence. Even the Americans claim to be tapped out when it comes to defence.”
A key obstacle until recently has been Japan’s inferior cybersecurity and counter-espionage capabilities, which have lagged those of the US, Australia and UK. Japan is not a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network.
The other hurdle has been Japan’s pacific constitution, which allows the country to defend itself but not to attack.
Japan has already shown its willingness to skirt these restrictions by providing surface-to-air missiles to the United States as part of indirect military aid to Ukraine.
While Kishida has failed to shine in many aspects of Japanese policymaking, diplomats and analysts say defence is the exception.
His popularity ratings, currently at record lows following a funding scandal in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), peaked when he visited Ukraine in March last year. His advisers hope this week’s trip to Washington will give him a much-needed boost in the pools.

Importantly, the Japanese people seem to be on board with Kishida’s more hawkish approach to global security.
They are increasingly concerned about the country’s hostile neighbours and whether Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sets a precedent for Beijing to make territorial claims over nearby Taiwan, and even over Japanese territory such as the island chain of Okinawa. Russia, too, has claims over Japan’s so-called “Northern Territories”.
In a rare interview with US media outlets, Kishida made it clear what his driving Japan’s shift in strategy.
“As we are witnessing Russia’s Ukraine aggression, the continuing situation over the Middle East, as well as the situation in East Asia, we are faced with a historic turning point,” Kishida told CNN on Sunday.
“That is why Japan has made a decision to fundamentally reinforce its defence capabilities, and we have greatly changed Japan’s security policy on these fronts,” he said.",2024-04-08T02:43:57Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review

"Global fact-checkers battle harassment, threats, financial perils","From India and South Korea to Croatia and North Macedonia, fact-checking organizations battling an ever-rising tide of misinformation in a major election year are buffeted by legal threats, harassment and funding shortfalls.Fact-checkers, largely under-resourced and increasingly under attack, have their work cut out this year as dozens of countries hold elections, a period when falsehoods typically explode.Debunking fake political claims and hoaxes that threaten election integrity, likened by some researchers as a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole, comes with a litany of challenges that are piling pressure on fact-checkers in a crucial year.The most significant is raising funds to sustain operations, according to a new survey by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) of 137 organizations across 69 countries.The Seoul National University (SNU) FactCheck Center, South Korea's only local debunking platform, faces possible shutdown after its biggest donor -- the search engine company Naver -- pulled financial support last year.Naver declined to comment on the reason, but the outfit's director Chong Eun-ryung believes ""political pressure"" from the ruling People Power Party was the ""biggest factor.""SNU FactCheck Center has been accused of bias by ruling party lawmakers, a charge it rejects.The development follows the closure of another outfit, Fact-check Net, last year after the government cut off its funding.'Information warfare'""Fact-checkers are facing growing amounts of misinformation with limited resources for reporting and publishing,"" Angie Drobnic Holan, director of IFCN, told AFP.""There are also campaigns of online and legal harassment against fact-checkers from those who prefer more cutthroat information warfare, without checks based on evidence and logic.""The IFCN survey said about 72 percent of organizations faced harassment, while many also reported physical and legal threats.Croatian fact-checking website Faktograf.hr has been forced to invest in security measures after its staff received death threats and female reporters faced sexist insults, executive director Ana Brakus told AFP.A text message received by one staff member warned that his fingers would be ""cut off.""""We had to find ways to deal with that kind of stress"" without affecting the fact-checking mission, Brakus said, adding the organization offered mental health support to its staff.In India, home to the largest number of certified fact-checkers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- tipped to win a third consecutive term in upcoming parliamentary elections -- has been accused of stifling independent media.Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of Alt News and a frequent target of government rebuke, continues to face legal threats after being briefly jailed in 2022 over accusations that he insulted a Hindi god in a tweet four years earlier.During a fundraising drive on X, formerly Twitter, Zubair wrote Indian media organizations were being ""forced to censor themselves"" and in some cases, ""becoming government mouthpieces.""'Existential threats'With their shoestring budgets, many fact-checkers must turn to external funding support to defend themselves against the ""existential threats"" that lawsuits -- often frivolous -- present, the IFCN report said.In some cases, fact-checkers are themselves targeted by disinformation.Truthmeter, the fact-checking service of the North Macedonia-based Metamorphosis Foundation, faced a sweeping smear campaign earlier this year after its fact-checks of Facebook posts prompted accusations that it was censoring content.The campaign, the group said in a note to readers, escalated into insults, slander and ""badly disguised calls for violence"" against its staff.""We are fully aware that such disinformation campaigns, full of attacks, manipulations, threats and hate speech will continue, especially in the pre-election period,"" it said, as North Macedonia gears up for the presidential race later this month.Content moderation on social media has become a hot-button issue even in advanced economies such as the United States -- which faces elections in November -- with many users equating fact-checking with censorship.""'Who fact-checks the fact-checkers?' is a common response to our work,"" said Eric Litke, who heads a US-based fact-checker, stressing the need for transparency to gain reader trust.Fact-checking organizations, including AFP -- which debunks misinformation as part of Meta's third-party fact-checking program -- routinely face online abuse from people who dispute their ratings, sometimes even when they peddle blatantly false information.""I've watched this movement label fact-checkers as part of a 'censorship industrial complex,'"" said Holan.""Ironically, this deeply misleading argument itself is aimed at suppressing critique and debate.""",2024-04-08T02:03:00Z,https://www.deccanchronicle.com,Deccan Chronicle
South Korea’s spring festivals disappoint as cherry trees blossom late,"CHANGWON - South Korea’s flower festivals in 2024 have so far fallen short of expectations as cherry trees did not reach their blossom peak in time.
The Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival Day Tour in Changwon, South Gyeongsang province, saw a drop of about 1.2 million visitors in 2024, a Changwon official told South Korean media.
While 4.2 million people visited the most well-known cherry blossom festival in South Korea in 2023, the city tallied the number of visitors at three million during the 10 days of the 2024 festival, which ended on April 1.
The blooms were expected on 360,000 trees planted in the area’s parks and naval bases, but the blooming rate remained at only 15 per cent on March 23, the first day of the festival.
Other famous cherry blossom festivals, including those in Yeouido and Jamsil in Seoul, also ended with many of the flowers still in the bud stage. The number of visitors to the Yeouido festival was less than half of 2023’s figure, according to media reports.
The festivals’ dates had been brought forward compared with previous years’ as the date when the flowers bloom has gradually become earlier. For 2024, it was forecast to be even earlier.
Festivals in Changwon and Seoul were brought forward by a week from the previous year.
But this March saw colder temperatures and less sunshine than average, which experts say resulted in inaccurate earlier forecasts on bloom peaks.
The inaccurate predictions were embarrassing for the authorities as the spring festivals have been an important opportunity for local businesses to promote their products.
Some cities decided to postpone their spring festivals, or even hold another festival.
Sokcho city in Gangwon province launched a second cherry blossom festival on April 6, a week after its first festival ended.
A post uploaded on the city’s social media account reads: “We deserve to die for our mistake, but we could not control the season.” The city explained it had to hold the festival twice because of the lack of blossoms.
Gangneung city in Gangwon province also opened its Gyeongpo Cherry Blossom Festival on April 6, after delaying it by a week from March 29. THE KOREA HERALD/ ASIA NEWS NETWORK",2024-04-08T00:20:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
Reports of workplace abuse in South Korea double over past 5 years,"SEOUL – More than 10,000 cases of workplace abuse were reported to the authorities in 2023, the labour ministry said on April 7, marking a steep increase every year since the government started compiling such reports in 2019.
According to the Ministry of Employment and Labour, it received 10,028 reports of workplace abuse in 2023, up 12 per cent from 8,961 the year before.
South Korea in 2019 revised the Labour Standards Act to stipulate in Articles 76-2 and 76-3 the prohibition against workplace harassment and the appropriate measures to be taken in such cases.
The ministry started keeping track of reports of workplace abuse in the second half of 2019, during which 2,130 cases were reported.
In the following years, the figure reached 5,823 in 2020 and 7,774 in 2021, and is continuing its upward trajectory.
The most common form of workplace harassment reported in 2023 was verbal abuse at 32.8 per cent, followed by inappropriate measures related to human resources at 13.8 per cent.
Of the 10,028 reported cases in 2024, officials took action on 9,672 cases, while 356 cases are still being processed.
In 2,884 cases, those accused of workplace abuse had been found to not have violated the law or the case itself did not occur in a workplace subject to the Labour Standard Act. The act can be applied to workplaces that regularly employ at least five people.
In 2,197 cases, the accuser had dropped the charges.
Only 57 cases led to an indictment as the law specifies criminal punishment only for the act of the employer firing or unfavourably treating the employee who reported an incident of workplace abuse, which can be punished by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won (S$30,000).
The maximum punishment for other violations is a 10 million won administrative fine, which does not remain on the offender’s criminal record.
Surveys indicate that the actual number of workplace abuse incidents is much higher than what the government report suggests, but many employees facing such abuse do not report it for fear of retribution.
In February, local pollster Hankook Research announced the results of its survey of 1,000 employees across the country, which showed that 46 per cent of respondents have experienced some level of abuse at work.
About 33 per cent of them said they chose to do nothing, while 31 per cent said they quit their job and 25 per cent said they sought help from those around them.
Only 8 per cent reported the case to organisations outside the company.
The same survey showed that 96 per cent of respondents thought that the legal clause banning workplace harassment should be applied to all workers, including those working for an employer with less than five employees.

Deaths from doctor shortage fuel election angst in South Korea,"SEOUL – In March 2023, a 17-year-old girl who fell from a building in the South Korean city of Daegu died after her ambulance was turned away by three hospitals that lacked doctors to treat her.
She was among more than 3,750 patients who have died since 2017 after local hospitals refused to provide care, according to a report by Professor Cheong Yooseok from Dankook University in Cheonan city.
The startling statistic from one of Asia’s richest countries has become a major issue in the parliamentary elections taking place on April 10. While the country won acclaim for its low fatality rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus now is on inefficiency, waste and skewed economic incentives in the healthcare system.
Renowned medical centres in Seoul are overwhelmed by patients, while the rest of the country struggles with a lack of physicians. A six-week-and-counting national walk-out by nearly 13,000 residents and interns protesting a plan to boost medical school enrolment has exacerbated the situation.
Mr Jung Seung-pyo, an esophageal cancer patient who lives on Jeju Island, flew to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for surgery in June 2023. While he is supposed to have check-ups every four weeks, sometimes it takes several months to get an appointment.
“There’s no doctor at all on this island who can treat esophageal cancer,” Mr Jung said of his hometown, which has a population of almost 700,000 people. “Everything is so concentrated in Seoul.”
South Korea has among the fewest doctors per capita of all developed countries and has not increased the number of medical students in more than two decades, said Mr Gaetan Lafortune, a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Demographic factors like the rapidly ageing population will exacerbate the scarcity, he said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has vowed to address the crisis. He proposed measures, like increasing the number of doctors, that have drawn complaints for being “populist moves” ahead of the election to select the 300-member National Assembly.
While his conservative People Power Party is currently in power, he is trying to flip dozens of seats held by his progressive rivals, led by the Democratic Party, to take control of the national legislature.
The healthcare system is “collapsing”, Mr Yoon said at a public hearing in February. “Now is the golden time to push reforms.”
Yet the doctors themselves oppose efforts to expand physician supply, arguing that the government’s proposal to increase medical school enrolment by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058 does not address the root problem.
This, they say, is that doctor pay in some critical fields covered by the country’s National Health Insurance system is far lower than that for outside specialists, especially those who do cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. The disparity in compensation and infrastructure between Seoul and rural areas also means a dearth of medical workers outside the capital.
“Doctors are disappearing at emergency centres, surgery rooms, delivery rooms, and hospitals in smaller cities,” said Prof Cheong in a December report. “Many young doctors gave up becoming fellows at medical colleges and work in the beauty industry.”
Cosmetic surgery has aggressively taken hold and medical tourism is booming in South Korea. More than 8 million foreign patients arrived between 2009 and 2022, many for the beauty industry that offers ubiquitous access to plastic surgery, Botox for US$6 (S$8) per shot, and laser skin tightening.
Meanwhile, essential fields including pediatrics have been hard hit. Only 53 residents applied to fill 205 paediatric slots for 2024, and just eight were outside Seoul and its surroundings, according to the health ministry. For paediatric surgery, two trainee doctors applied for spots outside of the greater Seoul area.",2024-04-07T23:15:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times

Våpnene brukes i stor skala mot ukrainske mål, sivile som militære. Takket være disse dronene, missilene og ammunisjon, klarer Putins krigsmaskin å holde seg flytende.
Det er dette som nå bekymrer Ukrainas allierte, spesielt USA og Nato.

Although the current influence of such content on audience perspectives is limited, China’s ongoing exploration of enhancing memes, videos, and audio could potentially become more impactful in the future, according to the analysis.
These concerns come in the wake of reports of Chinese cyber and influence actors engaging in espionage and operations across various regions. These cyber actors have refined their methods, utilising AI-generated content to sow discord within the US and exacerbate tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, including Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, Watts highlighted in the blog post.
In the blog post titled China Tests US Voter Fault Lines and Ramps AI Content to Boost Its Geopolitical Interests, Watts discusses the specific topics where China has used AI-generated content to gauge voters’ mindsets ahead of elections.
These topics include the train derailment in Kentucky in November 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, the disposal of Japanese nuclear wastewater, drug use in the US as well as immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.
Watts also noted that during the Taiwanese presidential election in January, there was a notable increase in the utilisation of AI-generated content to enhance information operations by actors affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — marking the first time that Microsoft Threat Intelligence witnessed a nation-state actor using AI content in attempts to influence a foreign election.
Since at least February 2023, the group identified as Storm-1376 has significantly increased its use of AI-generated news anchors, the analysis highlighted.
It added that this tactic of using AI to alter videos has been previously deployed against the same dissident. Moreover, Storm-1376 launched a sequence of AI-generated memes targeting William Lai, the candidate of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the presidential race, illustrating a countdown to the DPP’s removal from authority, it said.
According to the analysis, however, there is limited evidence available regarding the potential impact of these developments on India’s election.

The West is in more danger than it has ever been in, the head of NATO said in a dire warning on Saturday as he warned of an ""alliance of authoritarian powers"" working against the West's democracies.
Jens Stoltenberg highlighted the ever-strengthening relations between Russia, Iran, China and North Korea as he warned that the world is ""more dangerous"" and ""much more unpredictable"" and ""violent"" than it ever has been in an interview with the BBC.
""China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and, in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg.

Russia is also providing technology to both Iran and North Korea in exchange for ammunition and military equipment, the NATO Secretary General noted, which is an incredibly dangerous trade amid the ongoing war in Ukraine sparked by a Russian invasion in February 2022 and the raging conflict in Gaza, sparked by Iranian-backed militant group Hamas' invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, which was followed by intense retaliation by Israel.

The US and its NATO allies are on the side of Israel and Ukraine, while Iran, Russia, North Korea and, to a lesser extent, China, are on the side of Russia and Hamas, though the Gaza conflict is more complicated than the one playing out in Ukraine.
Essentially, danger stems from the possibility of a NATO country becoming fully involved in a conflict that one of the so-called ""authoritarian"" countries have their hands in, as an all-out war could break out, becoming World War III.

That's what the US and its allies fear now after Israel launched a deadly airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, killing seven of the country's top officials as Iran vowed to seek revenge against not only Israel but also demanded the US be held responsible for the strike.
NATO is hoping to send a ""very clear message"" to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Stoltenberg said, as the bloc urges the country to do ""significantly more"" to reduce civilian casualties in the conflict.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have killed more than 33,000 people in the conflict so far, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, and many of them have been women and children. The IDF's incessant bombing of hospitals and refugee camps in the region has led to mass casualties as dozens are killed in strikes that are meant to slay just one person.
The war in Ukraine is another story. The US and its NATO allies have been providing aid to the country as it wars with Russia — which is essentially what the treaty bloc was established for, to keep Russia at bay amid the Cold War decades ago.
(Image: KCNA via KNS)
Stoltenberg told the BBC that he's urging NATO and its allies to provide more funding to the region but that there's only so much NATO can do to help its ally, which he said will have to be OK with some ""compromises"".
A long-term funding deal is expected to be reached by members of the military alliance in July, he said as he tirelessly continues to lobby member states to fork up more money for the Ukrainian war effort. He wants to provide €100 billion (£86billion) to the country, but many countries, the US included, have been reluctant to contribute enough to meet that total.
He added: ""Even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future, we need to support Ukraine for many years, to build their defences to deter future aggression."" But Ukraine itself will need to chip in, too, he said.
Stoltenberg said NATO allies are working with other allied countries around the world, including Japan and South Korea, to stave off aggression from the ""stronger alliance of authoritarian powers"".

South Korea’s Election Is About ‘Gladiator Politics’,"The elections are ostensibly about the 300 seats in Parliament, but when South Koreans go to the polls on Wednesday, they will also be signaling support for one of two leaders who are locked in what is known here as “gladiator politics.”
The do-or-die rivalry between President Yoon Suk Yeol and the opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds the majority in the National Assembly, has made the elections as fraught with fear and resentment as any in South Korea​n history. Neither leader commands broad popularity, instead relying on hard-line supporters who either want to see Mr. Yoon, a conservative, impeached for abuse of power, or Mr. Lee, a progressive, imprisoned for corruption.
“This election is about who you want to punish, Yoon Suk Yeol or Lee Jae-myung,” said Eom Kyeong-young, an election analyst at the Zeitgeist Institute in Seoul.
On the global stage, South Korea is the dynamic exporter of cars, phones, K-pop and K-dramas. But at home, voter discontent runs deep. The country’s economy is slowing. Its birthrate is the world’s lowest. Its Gen Z youth — frustrated with widening economic inequity and priced out of the housing market — fear that they will be the first generation in the country’s history economically worse off than their parents.",2024-04-07T04:01:14Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
Leona Maguire makes matchplay semi-finals in Las Vegas,"Ireland's Leona Maguire watches the drive of Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn during their quarter-final match at the T-Mobile Match Play at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas, Nevada. Photograph: Orlando Ramirez/Getty Images
Leona Maguire won through to the semi-finals of the T-Mobile Matchplay Championship at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas for a second straight year as she saw off Thailand’s Moriya Jutanugarn 4&3 on Saturday.
Maguire, who gained the number one ranking after topping the scoring after three rounds of strokeplay, was two up inside three holes, but Jutanugarn stole a hole back with a birdie four on the par-five fourth.
A par on the short fifth was enough for Maguire to regain her two-hole lead and it became three up after a birdie two on the eighth. Back-to-back pars on the 11th and 12th to Jutanugarn’s bogeys put Maguire five up with six to play.
Jutanugarn did enjoy one further success on the 14th with a par to Maguire’s bogey but a par at the next sealed victory for the Cavan golfer with three holes left to play.

Maguire will face Sei Young Kim in the semi-finals after the South Korean got the better of an out of sorts Rose Zhang by 6&5, the young American star seven over for the 13 holes of their match.
Nelly Korda’s sensational form continued with a 3&2 win over fellow American Angel Yin as she looks to make it four tournament wins in a row. She will now face South Korea’s Narin An in the last four after her one hole win over Japan’s Minami Katsu.
A third-round 69 for a total of six-under-par 210 gave Maguire a three-stroke margin over the trio of Zhang, Yin and Katsu following the strokeplay, but all those scores are binned headed into the matchplay element of the innovative tournament on the LPGA Tour.
Maguire described heading the qualifiers as a “big mental win” in difficult, windy conditions with firm greens, where her patience on shot execution stood to her.
“It was so challenging and swirly and the winds and stuff, you couldn’t really get too far ahead or focus on anything other than the shot at hand, which I think was quite nice. I personally didn’t watch the leaderboards. I know Dermot [Byrne] was keeping an eye on them if we needed to do something. I kind of leave that to him and was trying to hit as many good shots as I could,” explained Maguire of her own mindset in navigating a route into the knock-outs.
Maguire was third in last year’s event and has again felt very much at home in the desert: “I love this golf course. I think it’s one of the best, if not the best, golf course we play all year. It’s an unbelievable test. It’s really a Major championship golf course. You get punished if you hit bad shots and get rewarded if you hit good shots, and that’s exactly how golf should be I think. I really enjoy the test that it brings. Looking forward to another day [against Jutanugarn].",2024-04-06T19:44:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times
"China might use AI to influence elections in India, US, South Korea, Microsoft warns","“With significant elections unfolding worldwide, particularly in India, South Korea, and the United States, we anticipate that China will leverage AI-generated content to influence outcomes in its favor,” the blog highlighted
In a recent blog post, software giant Microsoft has raised concerns about China’s potential use of AI-generated content to advance its interests, especially with major elections scheduled in countries like India, South Korea, and the United States this year.
The blog, drawing insights from Microsoft Threat Intelligence, references the latest East Asia report titled “Same targets, new playbooks: East Asia threat actors employ unique methods.”

“With significant elections unfolding worldwide, particularly in India, South Korea, and the United States, we anticipate that China will leverage AI-generated content to influence outcomes in its favor,” the blog highlighted.
The report also highlights the involvement of North Korean cyber threat actors in targeting elections in these three countries.
Microsoft’s findings suggest that while the immediate impact of China’s AI-generated content on election results may be limited, ongoing experimentation and the augmentation of memes and videos could potentially yield more effective results in the future.
“Although the likelihood of such content directly impacting election outcomes is currently low, China’s increasing experimentation with memes, videos, and audio augmentation is expected to persist and could prove increasingly influential over time,” the blog concluded.
Government quickly sprung into action to check AI-generated deepfakes after a fake video of Bollywood actor Rashmika Mandanna went viral.

Further, the Ministry of Electronics and IT issued dedicated guidelines for AI-generated content after a controversy erupted over a response of Google’s AI platform to queries related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Microsoft’s threat intelligence report shared screenshots of AI-generated videos in Mandarin and English which alleged that the US and India were responsible for unrest in Myanmar.

The report claims that it has found China-based threat actors continue to target entities related to China’s economic and military interests.
The company’s threat intelligence team claims to have observed targets of a China-based cyber attackers group Flx Typhoon in the Philippines, Hong Kong, India, and the United States in the early fall and winter of 2023.

Wie schlägt sich der Elektro-Koloss im Alltag,"Kia EV9 im Alltagstest: Kantiger Koloss mit Charakter
Von: Volker Pfau
Drucken Teilen
Mit über fünf Metern ist der KIA EV9 ein echter Koloss. Optisch weis das Elektroauto zu überzeugen. Bei der Reichweite bleibt er jedoch hinter den Erwartungen zurück.
Nicht nur wegen seiner Dimensionen fällt der EV9 auf, auch das Design polarisiert. Die Reaktionen der Betrachter liegen zwischen großer Begeisterung und totaler Ablehnung, wobei erstaunlicherweise die positiven Rückmeldungen überwiegen. Damit hat das Team um Kia-Chefdesigner Karim Habib alles richtig gemacht, denn wichtig ist, dass man über das Aussehen redet. Eine russische Uni hat ebenfalls ein Elektroauto entwickelt, über das man spricht – nur wird dieses als hässlichstes Elektroauto der Welt bezeichnet. Die glatten Flächen mit einfahrbaren Bügeltürgriffen und die auffällige Lackierung Ocean Blue Matt (1.800 Euro Aufpreis), in der die von uns im Alltagstest gefahrene Version GT-line Launch Edition daherkam, stechen ins Auge.
Der Kia EV9 hat vier Einzelsitze und eine Dreier-Sitzbank
Unser Exemplar war mit vier Einzelsitzen – alle davon beheiz- und klimatisierbar – und einer Dreier-Sitzbank im Heck ausgestattet. Die mittleren zwei Sitze lassen sich leicht per Hebel um 90 Grad drehen, sodass man einfach einsteigen kann und auch bequem nach ganz hinten kommt oder den kleinen Nachwuchs bequem und rückenschonend im Kindersitz festschnallen kann. Ganz hinten setzen sich wegen des dort deutlich reduzierten Raumangebots am besten nur sehr gelenkige Naturen oder Nachwuchs ohne vollen Platzbedarf. Laut Hersteller ist übrigens das gesamte Gestühl vegan.

Per Knopfdruck lassen sich die Sitze der zweiten und dritten Reihe vom Kofferraum aus umklappen. Das Gepäckraumvolumen liegt zwischen bescheidenen 333 Litern bei siebensitziger Fahrt und 2.318 Litern bei voller Nutzung des Laderaums. Zum Einladen muss aber eine 82 Zentimeter hohe Ladekante überwunden werden. Zusätzlichen Stauraum, zum Beispiel fürs Ladekabel, bietet das 52 Liter fassende Fach unter der Fronthaube. In der Version ohne Allrad fasst der Frunk sogar 90 Liter. Die Motorhaube wird zum Öffnen mit einer Teleskopstange abgestützt, was lästiges Gefummel unter der Motorhaube vermeidet. 625 Kilogramm beträgt die maximale Zuladung. Wird diese voll ausgereizt, ist man also mit einem 3,3-Tonner unterwegs.

Dank 385 PS ist der Korea-Koloss bis zu 200 km/h schnell
Der Elektromotor liefert Ur-Kräfte von 385 PS und ein Drehmoment von 700 Nm. Diese Power lässt sich problemlos bändigen, zudem ist der 1,78 Meter hohe EV9 konzeptbedingt eher als feiner Reiseschlitten denn als sportliches Vehikel ausgelegt. Trotzdem ist man im Allrad-SUV auch bei hoher Geschwindigkeit sehr stabil unterwegs, sollte sich aber stets gewahr sein, welche Masse dabei bewegt wird. Nähert man sich jedoch der Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 200 km/h, kann man in der Anzeige im Cockpit der schwindenden Reichweite zuschauen, zudem stören dann auch starke Windgeräusche.

Obwohl wir selten schneller als mit Richtgeschwindigkeit unterwegs waren, erreichten wir die von Kia angegebene Reichweite von 512 Kilometern nicht annähernd. Mit mehr als 350 Kilometern pro geladener 99,8-kWh-Akkus konnten wir nie beruhigt kalkulieren. Von dem vom Hersteller angegebenen Verbrauch von 20,2 kWh auf 100 Kilometer blieben wir weit entfernt, bei fast durchgehend moderater Fahrweise kamen wir letztlich auf einen Durchschnitt von 27,8 kWh auf 100 Kilometer. Mit ein paar Tricks kann man dank Rekuperation aber auch einige Kilometer Reichweite zusätzlich herausholen.
Stolzer Preis und luxuriöse Ausstattung
Der Grundpreis für den EV9 AWD in der GT-line-Ausstattung betragen 83.190 Euro. Dafür gibt es ein Auto mit Luxus-Ausstattung. So hat der EV9 zum Beispiel zwei Schiebedächer, für die zweite Sitzreihe ist ein großes, verschiebbares Staufach in der Mittelkonsole versteckt und im Kofferraum befindet sich eine 230-Volt-Steckdose. Nobel und benutzerfreundlich ist auch, dass sich der Deckel der Ladebuchse auf Knopfdruck schließt. Nicht ganz optimal ist dagegen, dass der Lenkstockhebel mit dem Startknopf und der Fahrprogrammwahl vom Lenkrad verdeckt wird. Es dauert geraume Zeit, bis man intuitiv draufhat, wie dies ohne Fehler zu bedienen ist. Wenig benutzerfreundlich sind auch die fummeligen Drehregler auf dem Lenkrad.

"China, North Korea targeting elections in India, US? Microsoft warns of AI use, cryptocurrency heists","China is likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content to target elections in India, the US and South Korea, and understand issues that divide voters in these countries ahead of national elections, Microsoft warned on Friday.
In a blog post, Microsoft cited its report on 'Threat Intelligence insights' to explain how China ""is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favour.""
ALSO READ: US tech giants turn to Mexico to make AI gear, spurning China
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence insights in the latest East Asia report were published by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) on Friday.
The report said it is expected that ""Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors,"" will work toward targeting elections in ""India, South Korea, and the United States"".
How China, North Korea might influence elections in India, US, South Korea?
1. China's influence operation (IO) seeks perspectives on US political topics: China had allegedly begun using generative AI to create sleek and engaging visual content. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence continued to identify AI-generated memes targeting the US, it said.
The Microsoft report claimed that China increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world. The ""increased use"" of Chinese AI-generated content in recent months aims to ""influence and sow division"" in the US and elsewhere on a range of topics. Many of this topic included controversial domestic issues.
These topics include the train derailment in Kentucky in November 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, the disposal of Japanese nuclear wastewater, drug use in the U.S. as well as immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.
The Microsoft analysis also mentioned the company's September 2023 report which highlighted how Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-affiliated social media accounts began posed as Americans across the political spectrum and responded to comments from authentic users.
2. North Korea cyber operations: The report mentioned that North Korea has increased its cryptocurrency heists and supply chain attacks to fund and further its military goals and intelligence collection.
""It has also begun to use AI to make its operations more effective and efficient,"" it added. This may facilitate the development of new military capabilities.
It added that North Korean threat actors are adapting to the age of AI. ""They are learning to use tools powered by AI large-language models (LLM) to make their operations more efficient and effective,"" the report said.
3. AI-generated contents and anchors: The Microsoft report mentions a picture in its report, claiming that it shows how Storm-1376 posted videos in Mandarin and English alleging that the United States and India were responsible for unrest in Myanmar.
""The same AI-generated anchor is used in some of these videos appeared in a Taiwan-facing Storm-1376 campaign,"" it said.
Will these tactics sway voters?
The report, however, claimed that there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion. ""While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will continue — and may prove effective down the line,"" the Microsoft report added.
China's AI influence in Taiwan election
According to the report, China did a test run in Taiwan using AI-generated content to influence voters away from a pro-sovereignty candidate.
On Taiwan’s election day, Storm-1376 had reportedly posted an AI-generated audio clips of Foxconn owner Terry Gou, an independent Party candidate in Taiwan’s presidential race, who bowed out of the contest in November 2023.
""The audio recordings portrayed Gou's voice endorsing another candidate in the presidential race. Gou’s voice in the recordings is likely AI generated, as Gou made no such statement,"" the report added.
The general or Lok Sabha Elections in India are due in April-May, while the presidential elections in the US will be held on November 5. The national elections in South Korea will be held on April 10.
Microsoft shared a timeline that showed how China used AI influence in Taiwan election.

South Korean Party Pledges Access to US Bitcoin ETFs in Race for Votes,"(Bloomberg) -- Campaigning in South Korea’s parliamentary election has underlined the nation’s status as one of the world’s largest crypto markets, with both major political parties touting related inducements to win votes.
President Yoon Suk Yeol’s People Power Party has vowed to delay a digital-asset tax, while the opposition Democratic Party pledged to lift curbs on exchange-traded funds — including US Bitcoin products — that directly hold tokens.
“We’re going to allow the ETFs, whether domestic or overseas,"" Democratic Party policy specialist Hwanseok Choi said, citing its manifesto. Hwanseok, a member of the party’s think tank, participated in drawing up the manifesto.
Yoon is seeking to wrest control of the legislature in the April 10 poll from a progressive camp led by the Democratic Party. Official figures show that more than 6 million South Koreans — over 10% of the population — participated in the crypto market via registered exchanges in the first half of last year. That represents a sizable pool of potential voters in a pivotal election.
ETF Controversy
The US in January gave the green light for ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin, and the products have amassed total assets of about $57 billion so far. South Korea’s securities regulator quickly said brokering the products locally may violate the law, effectively choking a potential efflux of speculative cash.
The move stoked some confusion and roiled a slew of stocks. The People Power Party’s manifesto doesn’t dwell on the controversy, instead promising to delay planned taxes on crypto gains beyond the scheduled timeframe of 2025.
South Koreans have been active in the latest digital-asset bull market and are famed for their ardor for smaller cryptocurrencies, not just market-leader Bitcoin. Upbit, the biggest domestic crypto exchange, regularly ranks among the top platforms globally for trading volume.
Korea Securities Depository data show South Koreans last month poured more than $200 million into the shares of US-listed Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy Inc. They also flocked to US crypto-futures ETFs, which are permitted products.
Even election candidates have exposure: some 7% own crypto, according to a Yonhap report that analyzed asset disclosures.
Crypto Risks
The flip side of such speculative animus is that crypto is a highly risky sector — the nation infamously spawned Do Kwon and his doomed Luna and TerraUSD tokens, which blew up more than $40 billion when they imploded in 2022.
But memories of the wipeout, which impacted hundreds of thousands of people, are being overshadowed by this year’s $900 billion jump in the crypto market. A dedicated investor-protection framework comes into effect in July, and both parties have indicated they would also pursue wider regulation for the industry.
Along with the sops floated by politicians, that points to the possibility of greater acceptance of digital assets in South Korea, echoing a broader Asian trend. In contrast, many US officials are hostile to crypto.
Expectations are growing that spot-crypto ETFs will eventually be allowed, adding to the potential for the crypto market to be more “widely established as an investment asset"" in South Korea, Hanwha Investment & Securities Co.’s alternative asset analyst Yumin Kim wrote in a recent note.

【新唐人快報】Temu涉廣告不實 遭韓國當局調查,"【新唐人快報】Temu涉廣告不實 遭韓國當局調查
【新唐人北京時間2024年04月09日訊】韓聯社週一（4月8日）報導，中國電商巨擘「拼多多」旗下跨境電商平台Temu因涉廣告不實和不公平商業行為，正遭到韓國公平交易委員會（Korea Fair Trade Commission，KFTC）調查。
調查旨在確認Temu是否違反消費者保護義務，以及有不實或誇大廣告。
自去年7月進軍韓國以來，Temu通過發放折價券等方式吸引會員，並且採用類似賭博的輪盤遊戲以及直銷手段而引發爭議。另外，該平台的出貨延遲和商品質量不佳等問題，也引發消費者不滿。
先前，阿里巴巴旗下的全球速賣通（AliExpress）和Temu也遭到了韓國當局的調查，有人認為韓國當局可能將調查範圍擴大到所有的中國電商平台。
韓國公平交易委員會回應說，不方便透露調查案件的具體細節，但如果發現違法行為將會嚴厲處罰。
今年稍早，Temu在法國和英國推出的一項優惠活動也廣受詬病。這項活動為下載其軟件並邀請其他人註冊的會員提供高達100歐元（110美元）的優惠券，但是，用戶必須同意的條款中，包括允許該公司終身使用其個人資料。
後來，Temu喊停了這項優惠活動，承認有「對客戶數據使用範圍的誤解」。
近年來，Shein和Temu在美國也迅速竄起。據美國海關及邊境保衛局統計表明，2023年有10億個免稅包裹進入美國，而這些包裹大部分都來自中國。
美國允許價值小於8百美元包裹免稅，而Shein、Temu以超低價進入美國市場，吸引大批美國青少年下單。
美國國土安全部表示，進口到美國的小額免稅包裹，將受到嚴格審查，包括是否違反美國強迫勞動禁令、違反海關法，以及從事其他非法行為，來削弱美國企業利益，直指中國電商在鑽美國貿易漏洞。

Filipinas lose 3-0 to South Korea in friendly,"The Philippine women’s football team couldn’t sustain its defensive stand and absorbed a 3-0 loss to South Korea in the first of two friendlies between the two nations Friday at Icheon City Stadium.
Choe Yuri, Ji Soyun and Jang Selgi all scored in the second half, leaving the Filipinas reeling after keeping things scoreless for almost a good portion of the match between last year’s participants in the Fifa Women’s World Cup.

Both teams meet again Monday at the same venue to conclude the international window.

Coach Mark Torcaso has lost all four matches this year, all against superior teams which the Filipinas want to face in a bid to gear themselves up for big events in 2025, namely the AFF Women’s Championship and the Thailand Southeast Asian Games.
It was the closest the Filipinas have ever gone to getting a positive result against South Korea, which has beaten them by convincing margins in the semifinals of the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup and last year’s Hangzhou Asian Games group stage.
A miscue by Jessika Cowart opened the door for South Korea as her weak back pass intended for goalkeeper Olivia McDaniel allowed Choe to take advantage and put the hosts on top.
Ji followed it up with a free kick to the far side of the post to double South Korea before Jang added third later in the match.
Torcaso put mostly the Filipinas veterans in his starting 11, namely McDaniel, Sarina Bolden, Hali Long, Cowart, Quinley Quezada, Tahnai Annis and Sofia Harrison.

GIST Researchers Find the Link Between Human Activity and Shifting Weather Patterns in Western North America,"GWANGJU, South Korea, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Western North America seems to be experiencing more extreme weather events more frequently. From scorching droughts to torrential floods, the climate is changing rapidly, with no signs of slowing down. From 2011 to 2015, California and neighboring states experienced extended periods of drought, while 2017 saw heavy rains trigger catastrophic floods.
These events are linked to specific weather patterns. The atmosphere is like a network of interconnected pathways that determine how weather systems move and interact across the globe. In the Northern Hemisphere, there are three such major teleconnection patterns that affect winter conditions: the Pacific North American pattern (PNA), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the North American winter dipole (NAWD). However, the understanding of how these patterns change over time and their connection to climate change remains limited.
To better understand this phenomenon, a group of scientists led by Professor of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering Jin-Ho Yoon and including Ph.D. student Jueun Lee from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology recently conducted a study to examine the reasons behind changes in these patterns. Their findings have been published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science on 7 March 2024.
The scientists employed a sophisticated Community Earth System model that there is a regular influence of the NAWD for over 70 years (1951-2020), which is in contrast with the fluctuating influence from PNA and minor impacts from NAO. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a strengthening negative correlation between the PNA and the NAWD: as one exhibits a positive phase, the other tends to exhibit a negative phase. “This projected intensification of large-scale atmospheric circulation in a warming climate is expected to likely escalate extreme hydroclimatic events in mid-latitude regions like California near western North America,” explains Dr. Yoon.
The weather system is like a network of dominos, where one piece can trigger a chain reaction and set off a series of unforeseen events. Using extensive models and numerical simulations, the scientists deduced that these changes in how the PNA and the NAWD interact can be traced back to variations in the jet stream, a band-like flow of air high up in the atmosphere. As the climate warms, the jet stream changes, influencing patterns such as the PNA and the NAWD.
The study notably shows that greenhouse gas emissions play a significant role in driving the shifts. “Climate models consider a range of factors affecting the atmosphere, including changes in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities. By running simulations with and without the influence of greenhouse gases, we can compare the results and see how they differ,” explains Dr. Yoon. The scientists observed an association between higher greenhouse gas levels and the variations in the jet stream: the gases drive the northward drift of the Asia-Pacific jet core. Aided by mountain-related lifting over the Alaskan Range, contributing to the formation of potent high-pressure systems in the vicinity. This phenomenon strengthens the winter stationary wave throughout western North America.
Simply put, the study shows that the rise in temperatures caused by greenhouse gases is changing how air moves in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects the weather patterns that influence winter conditions in western North America and contribute to recent more frequent extreme weather events.

"China plans to disrupt US elections using AI-generated content, Microsoft claims","wildpixel/Getty Images
The Chinese government is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts to disrupt elections around the world, Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Team has warned. Microsoft claims that a host of Chinese state-backed cyber criminal groups are planning to use AI to interfere with elections in 2024 in the US, India, and South Korea. The company's security experts added that North Korea is also participating in the effort, which could span a variety of channels, including social media.
""China is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favor,"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""China has also increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world.""
Also: How AI will fool voters in 2024 if we don't do something now
Microsoft added that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backs cybercriminal groups that, in recent months, have tried to divide Americans on a variety of recent events, including claiming that the US government may have been involved in the Kentucky train derailment in November 2023, that the US is intentionally poisoning foreign water supplies, the reasons for drug use in the US, as well as ""immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.""
At the same time, Microsoft, which has monitored the group's communications across channels, said that ""there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion.""
Governments across the globe have always used technology extensively to influence public opinion, and especially in the past decade. Soon after the 2016 US election, several reports suggested the Russian government was actively attempting to spread misinformation to sway US public opinion. Other reports have suggested that China, the US, and many other countries have similarly engaged in cyber techniques that aim to convince people around the globe to side with their initiatives.
However, as AI becomes more sophisticated, the risks of spreading misinformation only grow. With the ability to create fake images, videos, and other types of content, it's possible for governments and government-backed cyber criminal groups to target many more people with far more believable content.
According to Microsoft, North Korea's involvement in the efforts center not necessarily on swaying elections, but on generating revenue for the country. North Korea already engages in stealing cryptocurrency funds and attacking supply chain software.
""The United Nations estimates that North Korean cyber actors have stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency since 2017,"" Microsoft said. ""Heists totaling between $600 million and $1 billion occurred in 2023 alone.""
Also: Tech giants promise to combat fraudulent AI content in mega elections year
Looking ahead, Microsoft said that based on China's activities so far, the chances of the country impacting global elections remains low. However, that doesn't mean this couldn't change in the future.
""We assess that China will, at a minimum, create and amplify AI-generated content to benefit its interests,"" Microsoft said. ""Despite the chances of such content in affecting election results remaining low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will likely continue – and may prove more effective down the line.""",2024-04-05T13:29:00Z,https://www.zdnet.com,ZDNet

Early voting kicks off with heavy turnout in South Korea elections,"1 of 5 | Early voting began on Friday for next week's National Assembly election in South Korea, a contest widely seen as a referendum on the administration of current President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photo by Thomas Maresca/UPI
SEOUL, April 5 (UPI) -- South Korean voters turned out in record-setting numbers for early voting Friday ahead of next week's parliamentary elections, which are widely seen as a midterm referendum on the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Voters began casting ballots at 3,565 polling stations nationwide in a two-day early voting period before the main vote on Wednesday for the 300-member National Assembly. Advertisement
When the polls closed at 6 p.m., some 6.91 million people, or 15.61% of eligible voters, had cast a ballot, according to the National Election Commission. It was the highest figure ever in early voting for a general election and well above the 12.04% turnout at the same time four years ago.
Yoon's People Power Party is aiming to take the majority in the National Assembly, which is currently dominated by the opposition Democratic Party.
In 2022, the conservative Yoon narrowly edged out his opponent Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party by a razor-thin margin. A Democratic Party-led bloc has held 180 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly since 2020, however, severely hampering Yoon's domestic agenda.
Advertisement
A poll released last week by Gallup Korea showed the PPP with greater support than the Democratic Party, at 37% to 29%. But Yoon's party would need to flip more than 30 seats to take control of the parliament, widely considered a tall order.
That task is made more difficult as Yoon has been saddled with low approval ratings over his handling of a wide range of issues from sky-high housing prices and soaring food costs to concerns over the country's plunging birth rate, which is the lowest in the world.
Last week's Gallup Korea poll saw his support drop from a recent high of 39% to 34% ahead of the election.
Yoon has also been at the center of a standoff with striking trainee doctors that has dragged on since February, while his administration has been beset by corruption allegations, including a highly publicized scandal around First Lady Kim Keon Hee accepting the gift of a Dior bag.
Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is facing corruption challenges of his own and is currently facing trials over a range of charges including bribery.
Next week's result will play a large role in Yoon's ability to press ahead with his agenda over the remaining three years of his mandatory single five-year term.
Advertisement
On the domestic front, Yoon has long been aiming to push through economic reforms that include taking on labor unions and reducing regulations on businesses. He has had more success establishing his agenda on the foreign policy front, where Seoul has taken a harder line against North Korea and strengthened security cooperation with the United States and Japan.
Yoon cast his vote early Friday morning in Busan while on an official visit to the city.
Lee also voted early in the central city of Daejeon.
""In the end, it's up to the people to decide, and I would like to ask you to vote early today and tomorrow,"" Lee said. ""If you give up your sovereignty, if you give up your vote, all that you give up goes to a few vested interests.""
While South Korea's political landscape is dominated by the two main parties, a wild card this year is the rise of third parties in recent polls. The progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, led by disgraced former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, has emerged as the third most popular party and is drawing voters disillusioned with the status quo.
In the last Gallup Korea poll, the party -- which was only formed in February -- had 12% support, highlighting the possibility of gaining enough seats to play a spoiler role in the tightly contested parliament.

The Japanese leader speaks ahead of a planned summit next week with US President Joe Biden, as the allies look for ways to counter China's growing influence in Asia
TOKYO, Japan – Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday, April 5, said he wanted to cooperate with South Korea and the Philippines, allies shared with the US, and even engage with North Korea to promote regional security.
“The current security environment is tough and complex, and we are at a turning point in history,” Kishida said in a group interview. “Cooperation between Japan and the United States and like-minded countries is a very important issue,” he added.
The Japanese leader spoke ahead of a planned summit next week with US President Joe Biden, as the allies look for ways to counter China’s growing influence in Asia and deter it from resorting to military action to resolve its disputes in the region.
The state visit to Washington, the first by a Japanese leader in nine years, is meant to showcase their close security and economic ties, with the two leaders expected to discuss cooperation on defense equipment and a possible upgrade in the US military command structure in Japan.
That meeting will be followed by a trilateral summit with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
“Close cooperation between Japan, the US, and the Philippines is crucial for a free and open order based on the rule of law and for economic prosperity in the region,” Kishida said.
Japan last year delivered four air defense radars to the Philippines and is negotiating a reciprocal access agreement with Manila that would make it easier for Japanese troops to train there.
A separate trilateral meeting between Kishida, Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in the US last year helped Tokyo mend relations with Seoul and bolster security cooperation.
Kishida has said he is also willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim “without any preconditions” in a bid to improve strained relations with the nuclear-armed regime.
Relations between the countries have been strained over disputes dating back to Japan’s occupation in the first half of the 20th century, and by North Korea’s past abduction of Japanese citizens.
“Establishing a fruitful relationship will not only benefit Japan and North Korea but will also contribute greatly to peace and stability in the region,” Kishida said.

She slept with a violin on her pillow in Korea. Her dreams came true in Italy,"CREMONA – When Ms Ayoung An was 8, her parents bought her a violin. She slept with the instrument on the pillow next to her every night.
Two years later, a shop selling musical instruments opened in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, her home town, and Ms An became a fixture there, pelting the owner with questions. “I think I bothered him a lot,” Ms An, now 32, said.
As a teenager, she decided she would become a violin-maker.
Eventually, a journey with twists and turns took her to Cremona in northern Italy – a famed hub for violin-makers, including masters like Antonio Stradivari, since the 16th century. There, Ms An, a rising star in the violin-making world with international awards under her belt, runs her own workshop.
Set on a quiet cobblestone street, Ms An’s studio is bathed in natural light and filled with books and piles of wood chunks that must air dry for five to 10 years before becoming instruments or risk warping. She shares the two-room studio with her husband, Mr Han Wangsoo, who’s also a violin-maker.
On a recent Monday, Ms An was hunched over a thick 20-inch piece of wood held in place by two metal clamps. Pressing her body down for leverage, she scraped the wood with a gouge, removing layers, her hands steady and firm. She was forming a curving neck called a “scroll”, one of the later steps of making a violin or cello. On this day, the violin-maker was immersed on a commission for a cello, which shares a similar crafting process.
Violins like Ms An’s, made in the tradition of Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri, require about two months of work and sell for about €16,000 (S$23,400) to €17,000.
“I can make a violin in three weeks, but I don’t want to,” Ms An said. “This object is very precious to the person purchasing it.”
Ms An was 17 when she hatched her plan to learn the craft: She would move in with an American family in a Chicago suburb so that she could attend a local high school, master English and eventually study at the Chicago School of Violin Making. There were no such schools in Korea at the time.
Her parents, distraught about her moving so far away to pursue an uncertain career path, tried to stop her.
“I didn’t eat for days,” Ms An said. Finally, they gave in. “When I said goodbye to my parents at the airport, they were crying,” she added. “I wasn’t. I was too excited.”
Two years after moving to Illinois, she discovered that one of the best-known schools for violin-makers, the International School of Violin Making, was actually in Cremona. So in 2011, at age 20, she moved to a new country again.",2024-04-05T05:35:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
"South Korea election issues: Green onions, striking doctors, an alleged sexist jab at a candidate","People pass by posters of candidates running for the upcoming parliamentary election in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, April 3, 2024. As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues. This represents a stark contrast from past elections, which were overshadowed by security and foreign policy issues like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)
SEOUL – Soaring prices for green onions and apples. Striking doctors. A politician's allegedly sexist jab at a female candidate. These are among the issues animating voters in South Korea this year.
As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues, staying away from traditionally popular agendas like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.
Recommended Videos
“I feel drawn to someone who talks about things that can be truly helpful to our neighborhoods,” said Kim Yun-ah, a 45-year-old Seoul officer worker. “I often don’t know when North Korea test-fired missiles.”
Experts say up to about 30% or 40% of South Korea’s 44 million voters are politically neutral and that who they end up supporting will likely determine the results of the April 10 elections.
A look at the upcoming South Korean elections and the issues affecting voters’ sentiments.
MODERATES
South Korea’s conservative-liberal divide is so stark that many voters likely have already determined who they'll vote for according to their party affiliation, rather than by looking at the policies of the candidates in their districts.
But the extreme polarization has led to an expansion of moderates who are fed up with partisan strife and who focus more on livelihoods issues such as prices, jobs and taxes, according to Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.
Choi estimated that roughly 30% of South Koreas are conservatives, another 30% liberals and the remaining 40% moderates. Other experts put the proportion of moderates at 30%.
“In a nutshell, even if conservatives and liberals intensely bicker over political issues, that won’t influence election results much,” Choi said. “The fate of an election is rather determined by the moderates who silently monitor livelihood issues and decide who to vote for.”
Some observers say liberal opposition parties could retain their majority status, making conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol — whose single five-year term ends in 2027 — an early lame duck. But others note many moderates are still undecided, so it’s too early to predict who would win.
Regardless of the electoral outcome, Yoon's major foreign policy agendas would remain unchanged, such as boosting security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan and taking a tough line on North Korea's nuclear program, experts say.
GREEN ONIONS
Yoon got more than he bargained for when he visited a Seoul grocery mall last month to promote government efforts to tame food prices but ended up inviting criticism by talking about the prices of green onions.
Looking at a bundle of green onions with a price tag of 875 won ($0.65) — a temporary discount price offered thanks to a government subsidy — Yoon said that “I’ve been to lots of markets, and I would say 875 won is a reasonable price.”
Meanwhile, the average retail prices of green onions has hovered around 3,000 to 4,000 won ($2.2 to 2.9) in past weeks, reaching some of the highest levels in recent years.
Yoon's throw-away comment has created a mini-crisis for his ruling People Power Party as candidates from the main liberal opposition Democratic Party have brought green onions to election rallies and accused Yoon of underestimating food prices and being out of touch of the reality.
It’s not just green onions. The prices of agricultural products during March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The prices of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.
Kim Tae-hyung, a 55-year-old moderate liberal, said he's almost decided to vote for a liberal opposition candidate running in his constituency because he believes the Yoon government hasn't done well on economy issues.
But he said Yoon doesn't deserve criticism over his green onion remarks. “Even if he doesn't know the price of green onions, I don't think it matters much as I also didn't know about it,"" Kim said.
STRIKING DOCTORS
The weekslong strikes by thousands of doctors is another headache for Yoon's party.
The doctors, all medical interns and residents, are protesting against Yoon's push to increase the yearly medical school admission cap by two thirds to create more doctors. They say universities can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that would undermine the country's future medical services, though critics say they simply worry about lower income in the wake of the supply of more doctors.
South Korea has one of the world's fastest-aging populations and its doctors-to-population ratio is among the lowest in the developed world. But efforts to add seats at medical schools is a politically risky project that past governments had already failed to achieve because of similar vehement protests by incumbent doctors and medical students.
Yoon initially enjoyed a rising approval rating over his recruitment plan, but now faces growing calls for a compromise as the doctors' strikes have caused numerous cancelled surgeries at hospitals and other inconveniences for patients.
“We absolutely need to raise the medical school quota. But the government is pushing for its increase in a too steep, abrupt manner that has surprised everyone,” said Lee Chul-seung, a liberal Seoul citizen in his mid-50s.
TOXIC RHETORIC
Fueled by contempt for the other side, the rival parties have spewed highly offensive, abusive language against each other.
When Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party chairman, criticized senior ruling party candidate Na Kyung-won over her alleged pro-Japanese views, he called her “nabe,” a combination of parts of the names of Na and late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon quickly called Lee's comments ""extreme misogyny."" Nabe in Japanese means pot, whose Korean translation is “naembi"" that can be used as a derogatory slang term to refer to a woman with many sex partners. Last month, supporters of Na's liberal rival candidate reportedly spread on social media a poster with a message saying “naembi tastes best when it's trampled on.""
Han labelled Lee's past comments as “trash,” drawing rebukes from Lee's party spokesperson who described “Han's mouth” “as ”trash bin.""
Also roiling the South Korean election race is former liberal justice minister Cho Kuk, whose newly launched small party is forecast by surveys to win 10-15 seats. Cho was once a rising political star during the government of Yoon's liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, until he faced a slew of scandals that hurt his reformist image and sharply split the nation.

The US tech firm said it expected Chinese state-backed cyber groups to target high-profile elections in 2024, with North Korea also involved, according to a report by the company’s threat intelligence team published on Friday.
“As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections,” the report reads.
Microsoft said that “at a minimum” China will create and distribute through social media AI-generated content that “benefits their positions in these high-profile elections”.
The company added that the impact of AI-made content was minor but warned that could change.
“While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft.
Microsoft said in the report that China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January. The company said this was the first time it had seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election.
A Beijing-backed group called Storm 1376, also known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, was highly active during the Taiwanese election. Its attempts to influence the election included posting fake audio on YouTube of the election candidate Terry Gou – who had bowed out in November – endorsing another candidate. Microsoft said the clip was “likely AI generated”. YouTube removed the content before it reached many users.
The Beijing-backed group pushed a series of AI-generated memes about the ultimately successful candidate, William Lai – a pro-sovereignty candidate opposed by Beijing – that levelled baseless claims against Lai accusing him of embezzling state funds. There was also an increased use of AI-generated TV news anchors, a tactic that has also been used by Iran, with the “anchor” making unsubstantiated claims about Lai’s private life including fathering illegitimate children.
Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut tool, which is developed by Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok.
Microsoft added that Chinese groups continue to mount influence campaigns in the US. It said Beijing-backed actors are using social media accounts to pose “divisive questions” and attempt to understand issues dividing US voters.
“This could be to gather intelligence and precision on key voting demographics ahead of the US Presidential election,” said Microsoft in a blog post accompanying the report.
One post on X, formerly Twitter, referred to a $118bn bipartisan bill in the US that combined a $20bn of investment in the US-Mexico border with a $75bn package for Ukraine and Israel. It asked: “What’s your reaction?” Another flagged the loss of an F-35 fighter in South Carolina last year, saying “only under the Biden administration” could a valuable piece of military hardware be lost – although debris was found soon after – and asked “what do you think about this?”
The report was published in the same week that a White House-appointed official review board said “a cascade of errors” by Microsoft let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior US officials. Last month, the US and UK governments accused China-backed hackers of waging a years-long cyber campaign targeting politicians, journalists and businesses, as well as the UK’s election watchdog.",2024-04-05T04:00:04Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Naver CEO to fight against U.S. Big Tech in AI arms race,"Internet firm Naver has earned its nickname—Korea’s Google—by pulling off an improbable feat: It dominates South Korea’s search market, having defended its turf from Google, the world’s top search engine, whose revenue is 40 times as large as Naver’s.
As of September 2023, Naver controlled 59% of Korea’s search market to Google’s 31%.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon,” says Choi Soo-yeon, Naver’s CEO since 2022.
Naver is hardly a household name outside Korea. But it operates a sprawling portfolio that pits the $22-billion-in-market-cap firm against other Big Tech giants on multiple fronts.
It has a controlling stake in both Yahoo Japan—the most popular website in Japan, according to Nielsen—and the Japanese messaging app Line—a WhatsApp rival—through a joint venture with SoftBank.
It runs Korea’s No. 2 e-commerce service, behind Coupang. (Amazon’s platform ranks fourth.) Naver’s $1.2 billion purchase last year of Poshmark, the U.S.-based clothing-resale site, expanded its retail reach.
In the streaming wars era, Naver has amassed content platforms of its own. It owns Webtoon, which hosts mobile-friendly comic strips that are popular across Asia. (Naver is reportedly planning a U.S. IPO for Webtoon later this year.) Naver bought Wattpad, a Canada-based platform for user-submitted fiction, for $600 million in 2021.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon.” Choi Soo-yeon, Naver CEO
Naver also has a small but growing cloud-computing business—a category in which Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reign supreme—and it’s launched a series of AI projects to contend with the release of OpenAI’s viral chatbot, ChatGPT.
In recent quarters, Naver’s many business lines have notched record revenues and operating profits, but Choi sees Naver’s mission as extending beyond its own bottom line.
Despite Naver’s small size, she casts the firm as a counterpoint in a global tech scene in which power is concentrated among a gargantuan few.
“It’s becoming a world where there are only one or two search companies and one or two commerce companies,” Choi said in a recent wide-ranging interview—her first with the international press—at Naver headquarters in Seongnam, just outside Seoul. (Choi gave her answers in Korean, which were later translated into English.) Naver “is a company that constantly fights against such a world and strives to preserve diversity,” she says.
Investors question whether Naver can go toe-to-toe with cash-rich rivals. Still, Choi’s goal is ambitious—perhaps even noble—and belies the role she was appointed to fill: that of a caretaker CEO brought on to steady a company in turmoil.
Choi, 42, was an unconventional pick to run the company. A Harvard-educated M&A lawyer, she joined Naver in 2019 as head of global business support to help lead the firm’s expansion. Three years later, the board named Choi as CEO to show it was prepared to overhaul its culture after a series of crises.
In May 2021, a senior Naver developer died by suicide after accusing the company of fostering a toxic work culture. A labor union probe found he’d been bullied by executives for years. A later government survey found that over half of employees felt they were bullied at least once in a six-month period.
In the aftermath, Naver said “there were some acts of workplace harassment by some executives.” Choi’s predecessor as CEO, Han Seong-sook, stepped down, as did Naver’s COO, and Naver tapped Choi. At the time, she told shareholders her most urgent task was “to recover Naver’s corporate culture based on trust and autonomy.”
But a second tragedy struck early in Choi’s tenure. In September 2022, another employee died by suicide while on maternity leave, local media reported. Months later, her family claimed she’d been mistreated at work. A Naver internal investigation did not uncover evidence of harassment, and Korea’s labor ministry could not confirm the family’s claims, a company spokesperson said.
South Korea has the highest rate of suicide of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and South Koreans work 200 hours more per year than the global average.
“There was a lack of trust in the systems, leadership, and board,” Choi says of Naver’s previous culture. One big change Choi made was to reintroduce remote work, a rarity in post-COVID South Korea. The option gives employees “the choice of what kind of working environment they can be most productive and create the most innovation in.”
The suicides were the biggest scandal to rock Naver in its 25-year history. Naver launched in 1999, when founder Lee Hae-jin turned an internal Samsung project into an independent company. By the mid-2000s, Naver had passed rivals like web portal Daum to dominate Korea’s search market.
Naver and fellow internet firm Kakao (founded by an ex-Naver executive) have made South Korea one of a handful of countries where homegrown search engines outperform U.S. search giants without government intervention.
Naver got a head start on tailoring a search engine that met the tastes of the South Korean market, says Bokyung Suh, a Korea analyst at Bernstein Research. Naver hooked users early with its busy homepage that was heavy on icons, links, and animations. Google launched a bare-bones search engine in Korean in 2000, but it didn’t catch on. Google updated its site to a feature-rich format six years later.
Naver earned 9.6 trillion won ($7.41 billion) in revenue in 2023, a record. Search and e-commerce generated 37% and 26% of sales, respectively. It made $1.3 billion in operating profit, also a record.
Yet shares are currently trading about 60% below a COVID-era high. Investors are concerned about slowing revenue from search (up 0.6% in 2023), plummeting revenue from display ads (down 10% last year), and the lack of a “punchy, clear growth strategy,” Suh says.
Naver’s lack of a punchy, clear growth strategy is especially worrisome in the AI age, when Naver faces U.S. companies that are investing billions in the technology.
As U.S. giants dominate English-based AI, Naver may be able to establish an edge in systems based in Korean and other languages, Choi says.
Naver has a chatbot, CLOVA X, and an AI-powered search engine, Cue. Both are built on its Korean-language large-language model, HyperCLOVA X, which outperforms OpenAI’s GPT in Korean, recent studies say. Naver has claimed that HyperCLOVA, an earlier version of its model, was trained on 6,500 times as much Korean data as GPT-3.0, which underpins OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Naver is also partnering with Saudi Aramco on an Arabic large-language model.
Choi is especially interested in what she calls “sovereign AI,” or a model that’s tailored to an individual user. “We focus on what companies and governments that want to use AI would want, and what needs Big Tech can’t fulfill,” she says. As AI becomes more common, “each group will need an AI model that best understands” its unique traits.

Much like her rivals at Google and Microsoft, Choi is also grappling with how to integrate AI—with its penchant to hallucinate false information—into Naver’s search product. “People need accurate information through search,” she says, though she hopes AI’s tendency to make stuff up will become “nearly negligible in the near future.”
At the same time, she also sees room for a traditional search engine—with its list of links to choose from—amid the generative AI revolution. “Not all questions in the world have a single correct answer,” she says. “There is still a need for exploration.”
Naver’s base in South Korea, a chip powerhouse, is an advantage in the AI race, especially its homegrown manufacturers “that support the Korean language,” Choi says. Naver’s chip partners include Korea’s Samsung and the U.S.’s Intel.
“It’s not healthy to rely on just one company,” Choi says. Is that a coded reference to Nvidia? Yes, she says in English, with a smile.
Just four of South Korea’s top 100 firms by revenue had women CEOs last year, according to global headhunter UnicoSearch. Just 6% of executives at the companies were women.
Choi, whose CEO contract expires in 2025, expresses some unease at often being a “sole woman” in business: “Simply because I am a woman, there are expectations for me to demonstrate skills such as effective communication, adept conflict resolution, and the ability to nurture people.”
Korea’s internet sector got a little more diverse when Kakao appointed its first female CEO, Shina Chung, in March.
“I’m not alone anymore!” Choi says.

I'm adopted and wasn't interested in exploring my South Korean heritage. That changed in 2020,"Everyone in my life knows me as Luke, but for the first six months of my life I was Choi, Jeong Hyuk.
My adoption records state that my name means Truth and Glory.
Earlier this year I travelled to South Korea, where I was born, for the first time as an adult.
During my first few days in Seoul and then Daegu, the city of my birth, a sense of home would hit me in waves, affecting all of my senses. It was the taste of the food, the colour palette of winter — even the smell of open sewer vents early in the morning was strangely comforting.
I experienced it while sitting on the subway too, which was unexpected and moving, because I haven't had a sense of home for a long time.
In addition to growing up as a South Korean adoptee in Australia in the 1980s and 90s, my childhood home in lutruwita/Tasmania was completely destroyed by fire in 2005.
A sense of ""home"" that affected all of my senses hit me in waves over the course of my first week in Seoul. ( )
By my second week in Korea, this feeling of home was constant. I mentioned this to someone I met in a museum and their response was one of the most profound parts of the trip.
""Of course,"" I remember them saying. ""Everything in this country has been designed for you by people like you"".
A long journey home that started in lockdown
Luke Bowden in Daegu, the South Korean city where he was born. ( )
I grew up with little to no interest in connecting with my South Korean heritage, instead wanting as much as possible to be 'Australian'.
Something changed in 2020 and I became curious about my birth family and past. I decided to reach out to a high-school friend, who is also an adoptee from South Korea, and asked for her advice on how I might find out more.
The search for my biological parents took years and involved DNA databases and petitions from the Tasmanian government to the adoption agency in Seoul on my behalf.
In mid-2022, the agency contacted my biological mother, who is now married. She denied being pregnant or having a baby and requested no further contact.
South Korea is quite conservative in comparison to Australia, and the assumption is her now-husband would be unaware she had a child before meeting him. Therefore, her only course of action would be denial.
I remember the day the woman from the Tasmanian government called with this news. I was at work and she asked if there was somewhere quiet I could go.
Unconsciously, I asked if it was good news, and quickly learnt it was the opposite.
I was acutely upset about my birth mother's response, with rejection and abandonment being such an inherent trigger.
When I mentioned this to a mental health professional weeks later, she shared something I initially dismissed.
""You've got closure on this now, Luke,"" she said.
""You've found the mother and now you can go and forge your own identity"".
Following my own footsteps
The adoption agency is the only place in Seoul is the only place in South Korea I knew I had been to before. ( )
Towards the end of my trip to Korea, I visited the adoption agency where my adoptive parents collected me in 1985.
As the elevator opened on the fourth floor I was greeted by two toddlers running around my legs.
A staff member gave me a tour of the building, explaining how much has changed within the building, with only the foyer remaining in its original state.
As we chatted at the building's entrance I couldn't take my eyes off the steps, consumed by the thought of my adoptive parents walking down them and onto the streets of Seoul with me in their arms.
With little information about my life before coming to Australia, the adoption agency is the only place in South Korea that I know I've been before.
My trip was coming to an end and the same friend who helped me begin the search for my family, organised a meeting with Professor Lee, Keun-Su, a former police officer who now locates missing people and works to reunite families.
With the assistance of a translator, Professor Lee said he might be able to find more information about my biological parents.
After our brief meeting, I was preparing to start my long journey home when Professor Lee invited me to join him on a radio show where he was due to do an interview.
It was last minute but I work in the media, so agreed. I was also purposefully being very spontaneous on this trip.
A message for my biological parents
The radio host and Professor Lee explained that they would ask me to introduce myself and explain what I was doing in South Korea. After this, they continued the program in Korean as I sat silently in the studio.
While I don't understand or speak Korean, I do know my biological parents' names, so it was a surprise to hear Professor Lee say their names and the province my records say they come from.
I realised he was doing a national call-out live on air for my birth parents.
Before I made this trip, many people asked if I was going to be looking for my family. It was never on my agenda because I already had closure.
It wasn't until the end of my time in Korea that I realised what the whole trip had been about: I was following Choi, Jeong Hyuk's footsteps — my own.
Back in the radio studio, Professor Lee pushed his phone towards my microphone, using a translation app to ask, ""what would you like to say to your parents?""
""I would like to tell them I have had a good life in Australia and to thank them very much for letting me be adopted. That I am well. That I am healthy and that I understand.""

Corporate Reforms at Risk From Opposition Win in Korea Election,"(Bloomberg) -- South Koreans head to the polls next week to elect a new parliament and the outcome may threaten the government’s Japan-like corporate reforms that have helped spur a stock market rally.
The results of the April 10 vote to select the 300 members of the National Assembly could undermine President Yoon Suk Yeol’s flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the “Corporate Value-Up"" program, along with a number of his other reform measures.
Stocks and the won have already started to retreat in recent weeks amid concern the left-wing opposition will score a major victory over Yoon’s ruling party. An opposition victory already appears the most likely outcome. The odds of the ruling party gaining a majority in the vote is just 20%, according to economists at Citibank Korea.
“I plan to wait and see the results of the elections"" before buying, said Jae Lee, chief investment officer at Timefolio Asset Management SG Pvt in Singapore. “It’s not too late to pick stocks after confirming that the government and the regulators show strong commitment to the reform"" following the election, he said.
President Yoon, who took office in 2022, is aiming to replicate Japan’s success with corporate reforms that have propelled its stocks to record highs. His plan is to offer tax incentives to encourage listed firms to improve their valuations, a measure that requires parliamentary approval. The Value-Up program has already helped lure record quarterly foreign inflows to Korean stocks, which have also supported the won.
Here are some areas traders will be watching as the election takes place:
1. ‘Value-up’ and Tax Cuts
A key plank of the Value-Up program is to provide tax incentives for those firms that put in place measures to enhance shareholder returns. Levies that may be cut include dividend income tax, corporate tax, and inheritance tax.
That agenda may face increasing resistance if the opposition wins big.
“A left-wing dominant National Assembly could be less cooperative on tax incentives"" for the Value-Up program as they are likely to be deemed as a tax cut for the wealthy, Citibank economists including Jinwook Kim in Seoul wrote in an April 1 report.
Without the tax incentives, the Corporate Value-Up program would lack much of the driving force that is necessary to make it successful, Bank of America economists wrote in a research note last week.
2. Fate of the Capital Gains Tax
Another of Yoon’s policies that may be imperiled in the election is the president’s desire to abolish the planned capital gains tax on income from financial investments.
Yoon in January pledged to scrap the planned tax — which is set to be introduced next year — in a bid to boost investor sentiment and stock values.
The government had earlier agreed to delay the planned tax by two years from its original 2023 implementation date. The proposal would impose a levy of at least 20% on income from investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds if annual capital gains from them exceeds 50 million won ($37,000).
The main opposition Democratic Party wants to push ahead and introduce the tax.
3. Currency Market Reforms
Yoon’s government is also seeking to extend trading hours for the onshore won as part of efforts to improve investors’ access to the local market — a move that could help get Korean bonds and stocks included in more global indexes and thereby encourage greater foreign inflows.
Pilot tests are being conducted ahead of the official extension of the won’s trading hours slated for July.
Some analysts say one of the key things to watch for after the election will be how the new parliament perceives these reforms.
“For me and the market, the most important thing is the government’s resolve to push forward with the market reforms and FX liberalization,"" said Wee Khoon Chong, senior Asia Pacific market strategist at BNY Mellon in Hong Kong.
4. Buy Election Volatility
The uncertainty surrounding the election is expected to increase volatility, but it may also provide a buying opportunity, some investors say.
A decisive left-wing victory may see a pullback in stocks, especially those that have seen big gains on expectations for the “Value-up"" program.
If stocks fall, there are a “large number of investors with the belief that the Value-Up program will continue, with or without legislative support, and willing to buy into weakness,"" Bank of America analysts including Joon-Ho Lee and Jeehoon Park wrote in an April 1 research report.
Peter Kim of KB Securities Co. agrees.
An election win by the opposition should not scare away investors or change the long-term direction that the Korean government is trying to take, said Kim, Seoul-based head of global markets at KB.
Possible weakness in the won after the election may also be seen as a buying opportunity.
Any election shock is likely to be short-lived, BNY Mellon’s Chong said. “I like the won the most"" out of all emerging Asian currencies in the second quarter as it’s expected to be supported by “strong foreign inflows and tech export recovery,"" he said.
South Korea’s stock market will be shut April 10 for the election, and resume trading the following day. There has not been any announcement yet on any close for the currency market.

"How a Violin Maker’s Dreams Came True in Cremona, Italy","Art of Craft is a series about craftspeople whose work rises to the level of art.
When Ayoung An was 8, her parents bought her a violin. She slept with the instrument on the pillow next to her every night.

"Hualien, Taiwan earthquake: Toll on Taiwan’s chip industry","When a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan’s eastern coast on April 3, the first concern involved the risk to people and property. Here, the news was not as dire as initially feared — only nine people have been reported killed as of Wednesday evening, along with hundreds of injuries. Considering that Wednesday’s quake was the strongest in Taiwan in 25 years — and that earthquakes of similar strength have killed tens of thousands of people or more in other countries — this could have been much worse.
Taiwan was largely able to withstand such a powerful quake because the island has taken earthquake preparation seriously, strengthening its building codes after past disasters and drilling its population in how to respond. The newest buildings tended to fare best — the 1,670-foot Taipei 101, the island’s tallest building and designed to dampen shaking in a quake, barely moved.
There was one other way in which Taiwan — and the world — avoided a worse outcome from the earthquake: the island’s all-important semiconductor manufacturing industry seemed to emerge largely intact. That’s good news — but it’s also a reminder of how fragile some of the most important nodes of the global economy remain.
The world’s computers can’t run without Taiwan
To say that Taiwan is important to the global tech industry is like saying oxygen is important to breathing. Taiwan as a whole is responsible for making 80 to 90 percent of the world’s most advanced computer chips — ones for which there is no current substitute. Taiwan’s TSMC makes up half of that production on its own, and 90 percent of the chips TSMC makes are produced in its 12 fabrication plants — or “fabs” — on the island.
Fortunately, all of those fabs are on the western side of the island, away from the epicenter of the April 3 quake. Even a slight vibration, though, is enough to throw off the highly sensitive work of semiconductor manufacturing, and some machinery was halted or even damaged. But TSMC reported that production was getting back to normal within a few hours of the quake.
Again, preparation made a difference — TSMC has invested heavily in earthquake resilience in its fabs, which the company says are designed well beyond code.
But part of the reason that Taiwan has made itself so resilient to earthquakes is that it has a long history of … earthquakes. The island sits on the Ring of Fire, which is the unusually cool name for the 25,000-mile long belt of volcanoes and earthquakes that surround the Pacific Ocean. As a result, Taiwan experiences around a thousand earthquakes per year that are strong enough to be felt, and many more that aren’t. And just last year Taipei discovered an actual active volcano within its city limits.
After a 1999 earthquake that did more damage to Taiwan’s chip-building infrastructure, the electronics industry was disrupted for weeks — and that was at a time when tech and computer chips were far less important to the global economy than they are today, when chips are found in everything from cars to refrigerators. A Credit Suisse analysis found that if TSMC’s operations were to be somehow shut down — perhaps by an even more massive quake — manufacturing across the global economy would be severely disrupted.
And, of course, earthquakes and volcanoes are just one threat to Taiwan’s semiconductor foundries. The better known one is just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s Republic of China has made it increasingly clear that it could be willing to use military power to force reunification with what it regards as a renegade province. Should Taiwan’s chip foundries be destroyed in such a conflict, the damage to the global economy could be on par with the Great Depression.
The fragile points of global tech
Is it the safest thing in the world to concentrate production of perhaps the single most important manufactured component of the global economy on one island that faces existential threats of both the seismic and geopolitical varieties (plus the occasional typhoon)? Not really.
But Taiwan is hardly the only critical node in tech manufacturing that happens to be located in a risky part of the world.
South Korea is maybe the second-most important location for semiconductor fabrication after Taiwan, with a 60 percent market share of the memory chips used in PCs and smartphones, and is the home of the major global tech player Samsung. South Korea also abuts North Korea, a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator who appears to be increasingly flirting with the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. It’s also at risk from storms and flooding, though at least its tectonics are fairly stable. (Maybe?)
How about Japan? It’s no longer the dominant player it was in the go-go 1980s, though the government has spent billions to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the country, and it now has about 10 percent of the global market. Japan is also one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth — it’s at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and typhoons. And should a war with either North Korea or with China over Taiwan come to pass, Japan will surely be on the front line.
The US? Well, America hasn’t been a semiconductor hub in quite some time, though the Biden administration is trying its best to change that (with mixed success). But it’s worth noting that the intellectual nerve center of global tech, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, sits on several major fault lines, including the San Andreas Fault. A major earthquake is a matter of when, not if.
Would it be better if more global tech manufacturing was concentrated in a safer place — like Syracuse, New York, perhaps the safest city in the US according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Risk Index? Sure. But that’s highly unlikely to happen.
The reality is that something as incredibly complex as the global tech manufacturing supply chain is inherently going to be fragile. The best we might be able to hope for is that the areas where we have concentrated that vulnerability take every step they can to prepare for that risk. Taiwan — at least when it comes to earthquakes — has done that.",2024-04-04T13:00:00Z,https://www.vox.com,Vox.com
A Photographer Flew His Drone into North Korea,"A photographer flew his drone into North Korea and captured fascinating images of the secretive country.
In a post published on March 28, Redditor XiaoHao2 shared a series of rare photos that he took after allegedly sending is drone into North Korea from Dandong, China in 2020.
“Drone pics of North Korea, I was in China, my drone flew across the border,” XiaoHao2 captions the Reddit post that has been upvoted 141,000 times.
The photographer, who hopes to remain anonymous on Reddit, says that his DJI drone captured images and video clips of the northwestern border city of Sinuiju in North Korea.
Sinuiju, which is the fourth biggest city in North Korea, faces the city of Dandong in China across the Yalu River, also known as the Amnok River.
According to XiaoHao2, the drone images were taken around 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) across the North Korean-China border.
The photographer says it is currently illegal to fly drones into Korea: “Now it’s geofenced, but this was taken in 2020.”
However, it appears that XiaoHao2 had only chosen to share the photos online after years of keeping the risky images to himself.
A Rare Glimpse into the World’s Most Secretive Country
The Redditor’s photos offer a remarkable glimpse into the day-to-day lives of the people of North Korea which is one of the world’s most mysterious and reclusive states.
Some of the photographer’s images show North Korean residents looking up at the drone and noticing it flying past them. In other images, individuals appear visibly startled at the sight the drone crossing into North Korean airspace.
Other eerie images showed mostly empty streets and buildings, including what appears to be a university and a main avenue near Sinuiju Chongnyon Station, according to The Korea Times.
While Redditors applauded XiaoHao2’s images of the closed-off nation, many social media users were concerned about the drone photographer’s safety. However, XiaHao confirmed that he was still “alive and free.”
North Korea has always been shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Its population of roughly 26 million people lives largely in isolation from the rest of the world in the communist state.
The country imposed some of the strictest border controls in the world during the spread of COVID-19, and has yet to fully reopen to foreigners.
People who have entered North Korea as tourists in the past have been met with strict rules about the practice of photography in the country. Travelers are also required to follow designated routes, and places where photography is allowed are severely restricted.

South Korea's Yoon meets doctors in first sign of flexibility over walkout,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday met with the main representative of an association of young doctors who walked off the job in February, in his first in-person talks with physicians opposed to his medical reform plans. The meeting, which Yoon's office said lasted more than two hours, came after he showed the first signs of flexibility in his plan, having previously taken a hardline approach to the dispute.
The centrepiece of Yoon's plan is to raise the number of medical school admissions and increase the number of doctors, but many in the industry are instead concerned about securing better working conditions and legal protection. The government has said that without action the country faces having 15,000 fewer doctors than it needs to maintain essential services largely because its population is rapidly ageing.
Park Dan, who heads the Korean Intern Resident Association, accepted Yoon's invitation to meet with trainee doctors who walked off the job on Feb. 20 and conveyed the views of his colleagues, Yoon's office said in a brief statement. Yoon and Park exchanged views on improving working conditions and compensation for young doctors, it said.
The president's office said he will respect the position of the trainee doctors in his future discussions with the medical community on healthcare reforms, including increasing the number of doctors. The doctors' walkout has disrupted functions at hospitals, leading to patients being turned away and non-emergency surgeries being cut back.
Yoon has said the plan to raise the number of new medical students to 5,000 a year from the current 3,000 is not up for discussion but on Monday signalled there may be room for adjusting his plan if the medical community came forward with reasonable proposals. The country's practicing physicians and medical school professors have demanded Yoon scrap his reform plans.
The drawn-out walkout by thousands of trainee doctors nationwide is increasingly putting strains on the country's healthcare system. While a large majority of the public support the thrust of Yoon's plan, a poll on Monday showed more people are unhappy with the way his government has handled the stalemate.

South Korea’s Doctors’ Walkout Spurs Thousands of Complaints,"Six weeks after thousands of residents and interns at South Korean hospitals walked off the job, frustration is rising.
Patients have filed more than 2,000 complaints about surgeries and other treatments being postponed, canceled or refused, according to the national health ministry. Hospitals have closed wards and restructured staff. Nurses have taken on duties usually performed by physicians, and military doctors have been deployed to public health centers.
Much of the anger over the disruptions is aimed at President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has not backed down from his proposal to dramatically expand medical school admissions to address a shortage of physicians. The young doctors who walked out in February to protest that plan say it wouldn’t solve the health care system’s problems.
But many people are also exasperated with the doctors, despite the exalted position that physicians hold in South Korea’s hierarchical society. Critics accuse them of trying to protect their elite status, and their income, by keeping the number of doctors low.",2024-04-04T04:01:15Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
"Coming to Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI","“We hope to have a few more trolls in the future to connect the state and form a Rhode Island ‘troll trail,’” said Louise Bishop, South County Tourism Council president in a news release.
The trolls, which are made of recycled and reclaimed wood, will be unveiled at Ninigret Park in Charlestown in May. The initiative is part of a push from the South County Tourism council to bring more visitors to the Ocean State.
Two giant trolls are coming to Rhode Island this spring — an art installment of international fame by renowned Danish artist Thomas Dambo.
Dambo’s recycled art is featured more than 20 countries, including in China, Brazil, Australia, Germany, France, and South Korea. In the United States, Dambo’s trolls have drawn crowds in Illinois, Florida, and Kentucky. Five of his trolls, including one that stands nearly three stories tall, are tucked away in the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay.

“I am very much looking forward to coming to Rhode Island,” Dambo said in a press release. “My wife comes from New England, so I really love the area. I came last year for a site visit, I got to see so much of the beautiful area. I have a good idea for an installation with some really big stones. And if I have an obsession, it is that I like big stones.”

Dambo and his team will arrive in South County this month to start building the trolls, and they are looking for help from volunteers. (Interested volunteers can email jcordio@southcountyri.com.)
The imaginative artwork transports visitors to a magical world while conveying the importance of forest preservation, conservation, and our responsibility to the environment around us.
“My mission is Waste No More,” Dambo said in the release. “Our world is drowning in trash, while we are running out of natural resources. I spend my life showing the world that beautiful things can be made out of trash. I give new life to discarded materials by turning them into large-scale artworks. My aim at the moment is to build 1,000 Trolls using recycled materials all over the world.”

"Hollow Knight Silksong Has Been Rated In Korea, Please Remain Calm","Hollow Knight Silksong has been rated in Korea.
Ok. Ok. Everyone just chill out. Everybody just stay calm.
As spotted by VGC, which itself reported on a Resetera thread, it appears that Team Cherry’s anticipated Metroid-like sequel was rated in South Korea back in February and it simply flew under the radar until now. Its Korean rating shows classification officials rated it the equivalent of an Australian PG, suitable for players 12 years and over.
This news comes days after the game finally got a store page on Xbox, the last digital storefront to host the game. After its appearance on the Xbox Store started drawing attention, company president Sarah Bond took the opportunity to remind players that Silksong was coming to Game Pass on Day One.
Hollow Knight Silksong has been in development since at least 2017. In May last year, Team Cherry delayed the game from a planned 2023 launch and has not yet planted a flag on a new date.
Between this rating and the Xbox Store page, does it feel like there’s finally movement at the station? A little, yes. However, it’s worth remembering that a rating — even one from the Korean ratings board, which usually signals an imminent release date — does not mean a date is coming. Just look at Skull and Bones, which was rated in Australia almost a year before it actually got out the door.
For now, I’m urging we all just keep our Silksong hype meters set to Simmer. If anything else emerges, maybe it’s time to dial up the excitement. For now, let’s just stay seated and see how this plays out.

Canada's Gushue tops the Netherlands and South Korea at world curling championship,"SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland — Canada's Brad Gushue extended his win streak to four games with another two-victory day at the world men's curling championship on Wednesday.
He scored a 7-4 win over Wouter Goesgens of the Netherlands in the morning draw at IWC Arena and defeated South Korea's Jongduk Park 7-4 in the evening.
Gushue and his St. John's, N.L.-based team of Mark Nichols, E.J. Harnden and Geoff Walker improved to 7-1 to remain in second place in the 13-team round-robin standings.
Sweden's Niklas Edin (8-0) was in top spot after 14 draws. The six-time world champion posted an 8-5 win over Germany's Marc Muskatewitz.
Round-robin play continues through Friday night. The top six teams will make the playoffs.
Medal games are scheduled for Sunday.
In the opener, Gushue scored a pair in the first end and stole a single in the second to take an early lead he wouldn't relinquish. He added a single in the sixth end, a deuce in the eighth and one more in the 10th to seal the win.
""I think once we got up three and knowing full well the ice conditions were going to get tougher, it was about keeping it simple and making their shots tough,"" Gushue said.
The game turned in the eighth end when Gushue made a runback before a tap for two. Goesgens was forced to a single in the ninth end and couldn't manage a game-tying steal of two in the 10th.
""This is a long week and it’s going to be gruelling so you don’t want to make it any more difficult than it has to be,"" Harnden said. ""That was a perfect example of patience today.""
Switzerland's Yannick Schwaller beat Czechia's Lukas Klima 7-4 in the evening and defending champion Bruce Mouat of Scotland got by Japan's Shinya Abe 7-5.
Canada started strong against South Korea but gave up a deuce in the fourth end and took a 4-3 lead into the mid-game break. Park missed a double-takeout in the sixth end to set up Gushue for a pair.
Down three with hammer coming home in the 10th, Park rolled out on his first shot — a hit-and-roll attempt — and the South Koreans conceded.
Sweden and Canada were ahead of Scotland and Switzerland (both 6-2) and Germany at 6-3. Top-ranked Joel Retornaz of Italy was 5-3 while Norway's Magnus Ramsfjell and American John Shuster were outside the playoff cutline at 4-4.
Czechia and Japan were 3-6 and the Netherlands was 2-6. New Zealand's Anton Hood (0-8) and South Korea (0-9) remained winless.
The top two seeds will earn direct berths to the semifinals. The other four playoff teams will play qualification games.
Gushue won world gold in 2017 at Edmonton but has settled for silver on three occasions since, including last year in Ottawa.
Ottawa's Rachel Homan won gold at the world women's curling championship last month in Sydney, N.S.

SK hynix Signs Investment Agreement of Advanced Chip Packaging with Indiana,"To build advanced packaging facility for next-generation HBM, while collaborating with Purdue University for R&D
Selects Indiana for strong support provided by the state and local government, infrastructure for manufacturing, and talent at Purdue .
Industry’s first investment in advanced packaging for AI products on American soil, strengthens supply-chain resilience
SEOUL, South Korea, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — SK hynix Inc. (or “the company”, www.skhynix.com), the world’s leading producer of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, announced today that it will invest an estimated $3.87 billion in West Lafayette, Indiana to build an advanced packaging fabrication and R&D facility for AI products. The project, the first of its kind in the United States, is expected to drive innovation in the nation’s AI supply chain, while bringing more than a thousand new jobs to the region.
The company held an investment agreement ceremony with officials from Indiana State, Purdue University, and the U.S. government at Purdue University in West Lafayette on the 3rd and officially announced the plan.
At the event, officials from each party including Governor of Indiana Eric Holcomb, Senator Todd Young, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Arun Venkataraman, Secretary of Commerce State of Indiana David Rosenberg, Purdue University President Mung Chiang, Chairman of Purdue Research Foundation Mitch Daniels, Mayor of city of West Lafayette Erin Easter, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States Hyundong Cho, Consul General of the Republic of Korea in Chicago Junghan Kim, SK vice chairman Jeong Joon Yu, SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung and SK hynix Head of Package & Test Choi Woojin, participated.
Leveraging its dominant position in the HBM market, SK hynix’s new facility will be home to an advanced semiconductor production line that will mass-produce next-generation HBM, the highest-performing Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, which are the critical components of graphic processing units that train AI systems such as ChatGPT.
* HBM (High Bandwidth Memory): A high-value, high-performance memory that vertically interconnects multiple DRAM chips and dramatically increases data processing speed in comparison with conventional DRAM products. HBM4 is the sixth generation of its kind, following HBM, HBM2, HBM2E, HBM3 and HBM3E.
The company plans to begin mass production in the second half of 2028, while the new facility will also develop future generations of chips and house an advanced packaging R&D line. The site was selected due to Indiana’s resilient manufacturing infrastructure and R&D ecosystem, expert intellectuals in the semiconductor field and the talent pipeline at Purdue University, and the strong support provided by the state and local government.
Innovation in memory chips continues to drive lower-power operations and performance enhancements in computing. As tech shrinkage and other hardware improvements have hit limits, SK hynix’s new chiplet packaging technology has emerged as a promising way to continue enhancing density and performance. As this heterogeneous integration technology becomes more and more important to the future of the semiconductor industry, the company’s new initiative in Indiana will help establish the region as a Silicon Heartland: a new semiconductor cluster centered in the Midwest Triangle that will become a magnet for next-generation computing in the AI era.
“Indiana is a global leader in innovating and producing the products that will power our future economy, and today’s news is proof positive to that fact,” said Governor Eric Holcomb. “I’m so proud to officially welcome SK hynix to Indiana, and we’re confident this new partnership will enhance the Lafayette-West Lafayette region, Purdue University and the state of Indiana for the long term. This new semiconductor innovation and packaging plant not only reaffirms the state’s role in the hard tech sector, but is also another tremendous step forward in advancing U.S. innovation and national security, putting Hoosiers at the forefront of national and global advancements.”
U.S. Senator Todd Young, a key advocate for the project, said, “SK hynix will soon be a household name in Indiana. This incredible investment demonstrates their confidence in Hoosier workers, and I’m excited to welcome them to our state.” Adding, “The CHIPS and Science Act opened a door that Indiana has been able to sprint through, and companies like SK hynix are helping to build our high-tech future.”
“SK hynix is the global pioneer and dominant market leader in memory chips for AI,” Purdue University President Mung Chiang said. “This transformational investment reflects our state and university’s tremendous strength in semiconductors, hardware AI, and hard tech corridor. It is also a monumental moment for completing the supply chain of digital economy in our country through chips advanced packaging. Located at Purdue Research Park, the largest facility of its kind at a U.S. university will grow and succeed through innovation.”
“We are excited to become the first in the industry to build a state-of-the-art advanced packaging facility for AI products in the United States that will help strengthen supply-chain resilience and develop a local semiconductor ecosystem,” said SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung. “With this new facility, we hope to advance our goal of providing AI memory chips with unmatched capabilities, serving the needs of our customers.”
“We are grateful for the support from the Government of Indiana, Purdue University, and the broader community involved, and we look forward to expanding our partnership in the long run.”
As a technology leader, integrator, and enabler in memory solutions, SK hynix is collaborating with Purdue University, one of the leading research institutions in the U.S., on plans for future R&D projects. These projects include work on advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration with Purdue’s Birck Nanotechnology Center and other research institutes and industry partners. They also hope to collaborate on a project related to memory-centric solutions and architecture for the generative AI era, specifically system-level memory design and in/near-memory computing.
The company also plans to collaborate with Purdue University and Ivy Tech Community College to develop training programs and interdisciplinary degree curricula that will cultivate a high-tech workforce and build a reliable pipeline of new talent.
Meanwhile, SK hynix plans to support the work of Purdue Research Foundation and other local non-profits and charities by building partnerships that provide community development, growth opportunities, and leadership training.
Separately, SK hynix will also proceed with Korean domestic investments as planned. The company has been working to prepare the site for the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster where it will invest 120 trillion won to build production facilities. The company plans to break ground on the first fab in March of 2025, with plans for completion in early 2027. It will also build a mini fab, a facility with equipment for 300mm wafer processing, to test semiconductor materials, components and equipment.

South Korea’s Yoon Seeks Majority to End Parliament Deadlock,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea holds elections on April 10 for its parliament that will determine if President Yoon Suk Yeol can wrest control of the legislature and advance pro-business policies in the final three years of his term or instead becomes a virtual lame duck, with progressive forces continuing to thwart his agenda.
All 300 seats are up for grabs in the unicameral parliament known as the National Assembly, and Yoon’s conservative People Power Party is trying to flip more than 30 seats to gain the majority now held by the progressive camp led by the main opposition Democratic Party. The latest polling shows the PPP as the most popular party but its margin may not be enough to wrest control of the body in the election that serves as the only nationwide referendum on Yoon’s government during his single, five-year term.
Key issues for voters include inflation that is eating into paychecks, reining in housing prices and providing strength for the country’s export-driven and slowing economy. Yoon has been trying to end a walkout by doctors that has rattled the health care system before the polls, while North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is stirring the pot with provocations that include a missile launch and overseeing drills for operations that would be used in an invasion.
Here are a few key factors to watch:
Numbers
The most likely scenario is for the Democratic Party-led progressive bloc to keep its majority in parliament, which currently stands at 169 seats, with a few spots being flipped on the margins that do not dramatically upend the status quo. This would mean continued gridlock and compromise between the groups on key items such as the budget.
To get a majority, the PPP-led bloc would need to pick up 32 seats, a tall order especially with polling showing Yoon’s support rate in the mid 30% level.
If the progressive bloc can secure 180 seats, it can block any attempts to delay a legislative procedure, such as by filibuster. If it reaches 200 seats, it can override any presidential veto and approve impeachment measures, effectively hobbling and perhaps even ending Yoon’s government.
Policies
Yoon and the PPP are looking to: reduce regulations on businesses, take on labor unions, and cut taxes for companies and on real estate transactions. Yoon’s foreign policy initiatives that include closer security cooperation with the US and Japan are likely to stay intact regardless of the results.
The Democratic Party is looking to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and the chaebol conglomerates that dominate the corporate landscape. It also wants to scuttle plans to drop capital gains taxes on income from financial investments.
In the face of rising living costs, the ruling party said it would push to cut taxes on daily necessities, while the Democratic Party has proposed cash handouts, both of which critics say are populist pledges.
Election
Of the 300 seats, 254 are settled by direct elections in constituencies and the rest are allotted by proportional representation. Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The term of office for National Assembly members is four years.
In one of the last major polls released ahead of the vote, support was 37% for the PPP ahead of 29% for the main opposition Democratic Party. The Rebuilding Korea Party, a new group that looks set to align itself with the progressive Democratic Party, was in third place at 12%, according to the survey from Gallup Korea, which was conducted among 1,001 respondents nationwide. It said the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Battlegrounds
The key fights will be in major urban areas such as Seoul, where the Democratic Party won 41 of 49 seats in the last election in 2020. Metro areas account for about 40% of the 300 seats and the Democratic Party took them by about a seven-to-one margin over the main conservative party in 2020, according to the Korea Herald.
Wild Cards
North Korea has a habit of provocations that coincide with elections and Kim’s regime has bristled at Yoon for taking a hard line on Pyongyang. Kim could be looking to stir up tensions to build support for the Democratic Party, which favors rapprochement with Pyongyang.
Cho Kuk, a former justice minister, is seeing a rise in support for his Rebuilding Korea Party, which could grab enough seats to change the dynamics in parliament. Cho, who was a prominent member of a Democratic Party government and forced out of office due to corruption charges, has indicated he could align with his former party, possibly giving it enough seats to reach certain thresholds of power.

"Saudi Arabia-South Korea ties grow with industry push, pivot east","April 3, 2024
A South Korean automotive company announced plans on Tuesday to establish a production plant in Saudi Arabia, bolstering the kingdom’s automotive plans as the Gulf pivots east.
Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicles signed a memorandum of understanding in Riyadh with construction equipment provider Saudi Diesel Equipment and Saudi steel fabricator Perfect Arabia Factory. The two Saudi firms will locally assemble Tata Daewoo trucks, the latter said in a press release.
Tata Daewoo first entered the Saudi market in 2014 after signing a sales contract with Saudi Diesel Equipment to market the former's trucks. The company exported 670 large trucks to the kingdom and recorded $35.5 million in sales in 2023. The South Korean firm aims to boost its exports to 1,000 trucks per year, according to the release.
Why it matters: The announcement of the project comes as Saudi Arabia seeks to boost its domestic automobile industry. The kingdom currently imports the majority of its vehicles, bringing in some $13.2 billion worth of cars in 2022, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Exports, on the other hand, stood at just $19 million that same year.",2024-04-03T15:34:24Z,https://www.al-monitor.com,Al-Monitor
US Ally Seizes Chinese Vessels,"South Korea's Coast Guard seized five Chinese vessels for allegedly fishing illegally in the country's waters late last month, confiscating boats and deporting several crew members.
The coast guard said it carried out the raid while on patrol with the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries within the country's exclusive economic zone.
An exclusive economic zone is a 200-nautical-mile (230-mile) zone in which maritime law grants a coastal country the sole right to natural resources.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing significantly harms global fish stocks, ecosystems, and the livelihoods of lawful fisherfolk. China, with the world's largest distant-water fishing fleet, plays a substantial role in this issue.
The joint patrol's 30 participating vessels and three aircraft waters were operating in the vicinity of Jeju Island from March 25-31, Korea JoongAng Daily reported.
The country's coast guard said that, on average, 300 Chinese vessels fish illegally in the country's exclusive waters each day, with that figure dropping to an estimated 140 during periods of intensified crackdowns.
One of the Chinese boats had prepared 31 large fishing nets, each one worth over $44,000, according to the maritime law enforcement agency. Patrol members destroyed 20 of these and planned to take possession of the others.
A Chinese vessel was also caught trespassing in waters near the de facto maritime boundary separating South Korea from the North.
The crew was found to have underreported their catches. They were also using a type of net banned in South Korea because it was specially designed to catch even young fish, depleting local stocks.
The Coast Guard issued a total of $333,000 in fines and arrested one of the boats' captains. Five of the Chinese nationals were later deported, according to the report.

""We will take strong measures against those who conduct illegal fishing activities, which ruin marine resources by sweeping up young fish,"" Korea JoongAng Daily quoted one Coast Guard official as saying.
The official pointed out that Seoul regularly discloses illegal fishing activities with international perpetrators' countries of origin during diplomatic talks and presses them to take preventative action.
Newsweek reached out to the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., and the Korea Oceanographic Data Center with written requests for comment.
Chinese fishing vessels are often linked to overfishing and resource exploitation in international waters and in the exclusive economic zones of other nations, challenging efforts to sustain marine populations and enforce regulations.
Last month, Chinese fishing boats suspected of breaking Vanuatu's fishing laws were boarded by officials of the South Pacific nation's fisheries agency, along with U.S. Coast Guard members who were patrolling with them under a capacity-building program known as Operation Pacific Blue.",2024-04-03T13:54:13Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
North Korea says it tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile that’s easier to hide,"Open this photo in gallery: In this photo provided by the North Korean government, Kim Jong Un, left, supervises artillery firing drills in North Korea on March 7.���N�ʐM��/The Associated Press
North Korea said Wednesday it had tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, extending a run of weapons tests that’s deepening a nuclear standoff with neighbours and the United States.
With the supposed success of the demonstration, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his country had acquired the ability to build solid-fuel, nuclear-capable missiles of all ranges as he pursues an arsenal that can credibly threaten rivals in Asia and the United States.
But the South Korean military said the North is exaggerating the success of the test and its overall missile prowess.
The report by North Korean state media came a day after the South Korean and Japanese militaries detected a missile launched from near the North’s capital toward its eastern sea.
State media said the test was supervised by Kim, who described the Hwasong-16B missile as a key piece of his nuclear deterrent he vowed to further build up to counter his “enemies,” a reference to the United States, South Korea and Japan.
In recent years, North Korea has been developing more missiles with built-in solid propellants. Such weapons are easier to move and hide, and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled before launch and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time.
North Korea tested a solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time last year, adding to its arsenal of long-range weapons targeting the U.S. mainland. The country also has an extensive lineup of short-range and mid-range solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from land vehicles, ships and submarines and are potentially capable of hitting targets throughout South Korea and Japan. In recent months, the North demonstrated some of these missiles in drills it described as simulated nuclear strikes.
Since 2021, it’s also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defence systems because of their speed and manoeuvrability. However, it’s unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims.
North Korean official media KCNA claimed that during the Tuesday test, the missile’s hypersonic glide warhead reached a peak altitude of 101 kilometres (62 miles) and flew about 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) after separating from the launch rocket, and performed various manoeuvres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday maintained its assessment that the missile flew about 600 kilometres (372 miles) and accused North Korea of exaggerating the missile’s flight performance, although acknowledging that the North’s technologies were improving. The previous day, Japan reported a similar flight distance, although its Defense Ministry reported a maximum height close to that claimed by the North.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff said it remains unclear whether the North has perfected the technologies to ensure that the warheads of its hypersonic solid-fuel missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry.
“Hypersonic missiles are weapons systems that are still being developed by advanced nations (the United States, China and Russia etc.) and they require highly difficult technologies,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters. “It’s difficult to predict when they will be deployed operationally, but it’s expected to take a considerable amount of time.”
The North also tested a purported hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile in January, years after it flight-tested liquid-fuel IRBMs. Experts say such weapons if perfected is potentially capable of reaching remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
“North Korea’s development of hypersonic IRBMs targets Guam, which hosts U.S. military bases, and even Alaska,” said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Research Institute for National Strategy.
Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the missile tested on Tuesday was likely different from the system tested in January, which state media didn’t name but was likely the Hwasong-16A.
North Korea in previous tests have unveiled two different types of hypersonic vehicles – a conical one and a wedge-shaped one. State media images show that the January launch involved a conical warhead while the wedge-shaped design was used for Tuesday’s launch.
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
Hours after the launch, Seoul’s Defense Ministry announced that South Korea, the United States and Japan conducted a combined aerial exercise above waters near South Korea’s Jeju island that involved at least one nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bomber.",2024-04-03T13:25:12Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail

Last month, North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles as part of its renewed weapons test, raising tensions after the conclusion of US-South Korean military drills viewed by Pyongyang as an invasion rehearsal. The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month. Experts predicted earlier that North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.

North Korea Claims New Hypersonic Missile Milestone,"North Korea has said it successfully tested a new hypersonic missile powered by solid propellants, a day after South Korea and Japan detected a missile launched from Pyongyang toward the east.
The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) published photos on Wednesday of leader Kim Jong Un overseeing the launch of the Hwasong-16B, equipped with a hypersonic glide warhead. He said the new medium-to-long-range missile demonstrates the ""absolute superiority"" of Pyongyang's defense technology and is a key piece of his nuclear war deterrent.
In January, North Korea launched what it said was its first hypersonic missile, with the South saying it flew 620 miles before landing off the Korean Peninsula's east coast.
Hypersonic missiles are designed to fly at a speed of more than five times the speed of sound, and their warheads manoeuver mid-flight, making them difficult to track and intercept. Missiles powered with solid propellants do not need to be fuelled immediately ahead of launch. This makes them easier to launch at short notice, harder to detect and destroy, and more survivable than missiles that have a liquid-fuel system.
North Korea has now developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for ""all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges,"" Kim said after the test launch, KCNA reported.

The missile is ""another powerful strategic offensive weapon"" and Pyongyang has achieved its goal of developing missiles ""with various ranges on solid-fueled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis,"" the North Korean leader said.
It would give Pyongyang the capacity for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide,"" Kim added, likely referencing the United States, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea's military said the missile traveled about 600 kilometers (372 miles) before landing in waters of the East Sea between Japan and South Korea. KCNA offered different figures, saying it flew around 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), reaching a peak altitude of 101 kilometers (62 miles). However, South Korea has disputed this, saying the numbers were exaggerated.
KCNA also said had limited the missile's range ""in consideration of safety.""
""The test-fire had no adverse effect on the security of neighbouring countries,"" KCNA added.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Republic of Korea said in a statement that ""the flight distance claimed by North Korea (1,000 km) differs from our military's analysis and is evaluated as an exaggeration,"" adding, ""The results of the analysis by South Korea, the United States and Japan are over 600 km,"" Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency reported.",2024-04-03T08:30:23Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
North Korea aims to adopt solid-fuel missiles for faster launches,"North Korea successfully test-fired a new hypersonic missile, state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday, the latest step in a plan its leader Kim Jong Un described as aimed at using solid fuel to power missiles of all ranges. The North is developing missiles and nuclear weapons undeterred by sanctions in the wake of U.N. Security Council bans, while analysts say solid-fuel missiles can be faster to deploy than liquid-fuel variants.
It drew swift condemnation from neighbours South Korea and Japan, as well as the United States for firing the intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into the sea on Tuesday. Kim oversaw the launch of the new Hwasong-16B missile, KCNA said, calling it a strategic weapon showcasing the ""absolute superiority"" of the North's defence technology.
It perfects the North's project for ""putting all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges on solid-fuelled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. That would give North Korea the capacity for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide,"" Kim said.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the launch probably focused on testing the missile's flight performance in the early stage of development, an area in which North Korea appeared to have made partial progress. But it ""exaggerated"" several specifications, from flight range to a delay in igniting the second-stage engine and quickly changing flight orbit, the JCS said.
Analysts said it was unclear if the North would exclusively build solid-fuel missiles in future, and what a switch would mean for its arsenal of liquid-fuel weapons, such as its largest Hwasong-17 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). North Korea may heavily favour solid-fuel systems where possible, but actually phasing out liquid-fuel weapons would likely only play out over years, said Ankit Panda of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""There are obvious strategic advantages to an all-solid-fuel force for them in the form of greater promptness, responsiveness, and survivability,"" he added. North Korea would need to have high confidence in its production capabilities to allow solid-fuel missiles to sit for a number of years, during which they may develop imperfections that lead to in-flight failures, Panda added.
""India and other countries have had problems with this sort of thing with solid-fuel missiles,"" he said. ""Liquid-fuel missiles, despite their strategic disadvantages, don't face this particular long-term handling problem."" A move away from liquid fuel would be surprising, given recent state media coverage of such weapons, but would make sense if North Korea wants an extremely responsive missile force, said Decker Eveleth of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California.
""Solid-fuel missiles are much, much faster to get off the ground in an emergency,"" he said in a post on X. Such a shift could also see North Korea place some ICBMs in silos, in addition to the mobile launch vehicles it has exclusively used so far, Eveleth added.
North Korea's pursuit of hypersonic vehicles helps its broader effort to field warheads tougher to intercept. Warheads typically launched by such missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200 kph (3,850 mph), often manoeuvring at relatively low altitudes.
That manoeuvrability, not speed, is the most attractive feature of such weapons, analysts say, as the latter can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads. Tuesday's launch, which followed a ground test late in March of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile, was also condemned by Britain, which said it breached UN Security Council resolutions.
In a rare step, South Korea seized a ship off its coast for suspected violations of the North Korean sanctions, the Donga Ilbo newspaper said on Wednesday. The South's foreign ministry confirmed it was investigating the vessel for possible violations in co-operation with the United States, but declined further comment.

Tidligere United-stjerne kritiseres i Sør-Korea: - Må ta en tydeligere lederrolle,"Lingard, som står med 232 kamper for Manchester United, signerte i februar for Seoul etter en periode som klubbløs.
Der har han ennå til gode å starte en kamp, og etter et svakt innhopp i sin tredje kamp for klubben gikk trener Kim Gi-dong hardt ut i mediene.
– Hvis noen som bare spiller noen minutter, ikke gir alt og løper mindre enn en som har spilt siden starten av kampen, ser jeg ikke på dem som en ordentlig fotballspiller, sa Kim i retning Lingard.
– Jobber alltid hardt
Senere modererte treneren seg noe, men gjorde det klart at 31-åringen «må ta en tydeligere lederrolle».
Lingard fikk svare på Kims utbrudd.
– Jeg jobber alltid hardt. Jeg sjekket statistikken min etter kampen, og jeg gjorde det ganske bra i forhold til hvor mange minutter jeg spilte. Det er bare noe han (Kim) sa. Mediene kommer åpenbart til å tolke det som mer dramatisk enn det faktisk er, sa Lingard.
Lingard startet karrieren i Manchester United før han senere spilte for Derby, West Ham og Nottingham Forest, der kontrakten utløp i fjor sommer.
Overrasket
I etterkant brukte han god tid på å ta neste steg i karrieren og overrasket mange med å velge Seoul.
– Jeg hadde flere tilbud, men ingen var skriftlige. Jeg valgte Seoul fordi de viste at de ønsket å ha meg, sa Lingard.
31-åringen fortalte i fjor at han slet med alkoholmisbruk under tiden i Manchester United for «å døyve smerten».
Lingard står bokført med 32 landskamper for England, og i VM i 2018 scoret han ett av sine totalt seks mål med flagget på brystet. I 2021 var han nær ved å bli tatt ut til EM, men nåløyet ble for trangt i konkurranse med flere andre gode offensive spillere.

"Korea's YG Sets Yang Min-seok as CEO, Gives BabyMonster Official Debut","CHANGING TRACKS
YG Entertainment, the firm behind K-pop sensation Blackpink, has appointed Yang Min-seok as its new, sole CEO. The younger brother of company founder Yang Hyun-sun, he was previously joint CEO with Hwang Bo-kyun.
The announcement was made shortly after YG’s annual shareholder meeting that closed the books on a year in which revenues climbed 65% to $430 million.
The firm, which recently denied that it had paid $30 million to retain its position with Blackpink (but saw the girl group’s individual members sign personal representation contracts with other agencies) is busily launching BabyMonster, another all-female act that is seen in some circles as a successor to Blackpink.
BabyMonster, which was formed late last year through reality TV show “Last Evaluation 2023,” is a seven part group with members from Korea, Thailand and Japan. The group launched singles last year and in February. But YG is now describing mini-album and new single “Sheesh,” released on April 1, as the group’s official debut.
Watch trailer for “Sheesh” here:
With a strong reception to the new tracks, BabyMonster is already booked for a five-territory fan meeting tour to Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia.

Korea Zinc déclare qu'elle donnera la priorité aux ventes intérieures en cas de baisse de la production de ses concurrents,"Korea Zinc, le plus grand producteur mondial de zinc, donnera la priorité aux ventes intérieures plutôt qu'aux exportations en cas de chute brutale de la production de la fonderie sud-coréenne, a déclaré un cadre supérieur à Reuters.
La question de savoir quelle quantité de zinc la Corée du Sud sera en mesure d'exporter est devenue une préoccupation majeure pour les négociants en zinc après que Young Poong, le deuxième producteur du pays, a déclaré le mois dernier qu'il avait réduit d'un cinquième la production de sa fonderie de zinc Seokpo, d'une capacité de 400 000 tonnes métriques par an.
Des sources chez les fournisseurs de matières premières de zinc ont depuis déclaré qu'elles s'attendaient à de nouvelles réductions de production de la part de Young Poong, qui est depuis longtemps déficitaire et qui est confronté à la faiblesse des prix et à l'augmentation des coûts de l'électricité.
Young Poong a déclaré mercredi qu'elle n'avait pas de tels projets. Elle n'a pas précisé combien de temps elle prévoyait de maintenir la production à son niveau actuel.
La demande sud-coréenne de zinc - principalement utilisé pour traiter l'acier - est d'environ 470 000 tonnes par an, dont Korea Zinc et Young Poong fournissent environ 400 000 tonnes.
Korea Zinc peut facilement satisfaire la demande sud-coréenne, a déclaré à Reuters D.W. Kang, vice-président exécutif de la division des matières premières de l'entreprise.
""La priorité pour nous est de vendre en Corée du Sud. Nous exportons le reste. Parmi les exportations, nous donnons la priorité aux primes plus élevées et nous vendons également du zinc sur le marché au comptant"", a-t-il déclaré.
Korea Zinc prévoit de produire 650 000 tonnes en 2024, comme l'année dernière.
L'année dernière, la Corée du Sud a exporté 609 145 tonnes de lingots de zinc selon les données commerciales, ce qui représente environ 4,4 % du marché mondial du zinc. Sur ce total, Korea Zinc a exporté 454 388 tonnes, a indiqué l'entreprise.
Dans un contexte de faible demande due à un ralentissement de l'activité de construction mondiale, les prix du zinc ont perdu environ 20 % par rapport à l'année dernière pour se négocier autour de 2 479 $ la tonne, ce qui a entraîné la suspension de plusieurs mines et fonderies de zinc au cours de l'année écoulée.
""S'il y a un problème de production à un endroit, le marché sera à court. Cela pourrait faire grimper le prix du LME et les primes, mais ne posera pas de problèmes pour nos ventes"", a déclaré M. Kang.
Soulignant la faiblesse des prix du zinc, des sources ont indiqué que la société minière canadienne Teck Resources a accepté de payer à Korea Zinc 165 dollars par tonne métrique, son niveau le plus bas depuis trois ans, pour transformer son concentré de zinc en métal raffiné.
L'amincissement des marges ne contribue pas à la perception selon laquelle ""en ce qui concerne le zinc, la croissance a presque atteint sa limite"", a déclaré M. Kang.
Il a toutefois ajouté que Korea Zinc était mieux équipée que ses rivales pour faire face à un ralentissement du marché, car elle traite une grande variété de métaux.
""Korea Zinc possède des fonderies polymétalliques qui produisent différents métaux comme le zinc, le nickel et le cuivre sur le même site ; nous avons également la flexibilité nécessaire pour traiter une grande variété de qualités et de mélanges de matières premières"", a-t-il ajouté.
Korea Zinc développe également ses activités de recyclage des métaux et a déclaré lundi qu'elle avait acquis Kataman Metals, un négociant en ferraille basé aux États-Unis.
Korea Zinc et Young Poong, deux sociétés sœurs fondées par des partenaires commerciaux, se sont opposées sur des questions juridiques et d'actionnariat.
Korea Zinc achète actuellement du concentré de zinc en vrac pour ses propres fonderies et pour les installations de Young Poong à Seokpo, et une société appelée Sorin Corp exporte les produits des deux entreprises. Mais les deux entreprises devraient à l'avenir séparer leurs ventes et leurs achats de matières premières, a déclaré M. Kang.
Young Poong a déclaré que rien n'avait été décidé.",2024-04-03T05:34:06Z,https://www.zonebourse.com,Zonebourse.com
EXPLAINER-Why is North Korea testing hypersonic missiles and how do they work?,"North Korea has tested a new solid-fuel hypersonic missile with intermediate range, it said on Wednesday, in an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range rockets hard to track and intercept.
The United States, China, Russia and other countries have also been developing hypersonic weapons in recent years. HOW DO THE MISSILES WORK?
The warheads they launch typically travel at more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200 kph (3,850 mph), often at relatively low altitudes. Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but manoeuvrability.
North Korea's first hypersonic missile test in 2021 featured a glider-shaped warhead, while a 2022 launch used what South Korean military officials and analysts said was actually a conical manoeuvrable reentry vehicle (MaRV), or a ballistic missile warhead capable of manoeuvring to hit a target. State media said the North's latest test was aimed at perfecting an arsenal for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide"".
Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could further strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defence mechanisms. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit.
WHO LEADS THE RACE? In February Russia for the first time fired its Zircon hypersonic cruise missile against Ukraine, researchers said. President Vladimir Putin has touted the weapon as part of a new generation and Moscow has also tested it from a submarine and a frigate.
China launched a rocket carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle that flew through space in 2021, circling the globe before cruising down toward its target, which it missed by about two dozen miles, however. In Sept 2021, the United States said it had tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon - meaning it flies on its own through the atmosphere like a cruise missile - in the first successful test of that class of weapon since 2013.
WHAT IS NORTH KOREA'S HYPERSONIC GOAL? At a Jan. 2021 meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, leader Kim Jong Un set securing the weapons as one of five key objectives of a five-year plan to boost military power, alongside developing solid-fuel ICBMs and a nuclear submarine.
In Sept. 2021, the North described its first hypersonic missile as a ""strategic weapon"" designed to bolster its defence capabilities, though some South Korean analysts called the test a failure. In early 2022, Seoul officials said the North tested another missile, potentially another hypersonic one, that flew at relatively low altitudes at up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,340 kmh/7,670 mph).
In January Pyongyang launched its first such missile powered by solid fuel to ensure a quicker launch with less preparation. On a rare trip to Russia last September, Kim inspected Moscow's hypersonic missiles, among other weapons.
WHY DOES IT MATTER? The global push for hypersonic weapons is part of an arms race in which smaller Asian nations are striving to develop advanced long-range missiles alongside major military powers.
Hypersonic weapons and FOBS could be a concern as they can potentially evade missile shields and early warning systems. ""Mid- to long-range hypersonic missiles would be useful for striking Guam while evading the U.S. missile defence system,"" said Chang Young-keun, a professor at Korea Aerospace University.

North Korea says it tested new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with hypersonic warhead,"North Korea said Wednesday it tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, extending a run in weapons demonstrations that’s deepening a nuclear standoff with neighbours and the United States.
With the supposed success of the test, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his country had acquired the ability to build solid-fuel, nuclear-capable systems for missiles of all ranges as he pursues an arsenal that could viably threaten rivals in Asia and the United States.
The report by North Korean state media came a day after the South Korean and Japanese militaries detected the North launching a missile from near its capital toward its eastern sea.

North Korean state media said the test was supervised by Kim, who described the Hwasong-16B missile as a key piece of his nuclear war deterrent he vowed to further build up to counter his “enemies,” a reference to the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Kim said the North has now developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for “all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges,” the Korean Central News Agency said.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled before launch and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time.
North Korea last year tested a solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time, adding to its arsenal of long-range weapons targeting the US mainland. The country also has an extensive lineup of short-range and mid-range solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from land vehicles, ships and submarines and are potentially capable of reaching targets throughout South Korea and Japan. The North in recent months demonstrated some of these missiles in drills it described as simulated nuclear strikes while issuing provocative threats of nuclear conflict.

The North has since 2021 also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to exceed five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defence systems because of their speed and maneuverability. However, it’s unclear whether the North’s hypersonic vehicles consistently maintained a desired speed exceeding Mach 5 during tests in 2021 and 2022.
During Tuesday’s test, the missile’s hypersonic glide warhead after being separated from the launch rocket reached a peak altitude of 101 km (62 miles) and flew about 1,000 km (621 miles) while performing various flight maneuvers before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, the KCNA said.
The South Korean and Japanese militaries had assessed that the missile flew around 600 (372 miles) although Japan’s Defence Ministry announced a similar apogee with the North Korean report.
The North had also tested a purported hypersonic IRBM in January, which came years after it flight-tested liquid-fuel IRBMs. Experts say such weapons if perfected is potentially capable of reaching remote US targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.

Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the missile tested on Tuesday was likely different from the system tested in January, which state media didn’t name but would likely be the Hwasong-16A.
North Korea in previous tests have unveiled two different types of hypersonic vehicles – a conical one and a wedge-shaped one. State media images show that the January launch involved a conical warhead while the wedge-shaped design was used for Tuesday’s launch.
While North Korea had initially tested its hypersonic warheads with liquid-fuel systems, the ability to load them on solid-fuel rockets would allow for faster launches and operation, said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Research Institute for National Strategy.
“North Korea, in declaring that it has fully accomplished the nuclear weaponisation of its missiles, also emphasised its commitment to arm its hypersonic missiles with nuclear weapons,” Chang said. “North Korea’s development of hypersonic IRBMs targets Guam, which hosts US military bases, and even Alaska.” Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets.

While supervising Tuesday’s test, Kim Jong Un called for his country to further expand its nuclear and missile programme to acquire “overwhelming power capable of containing and controlling” his enemies, who have “recently run higher fever in boosting their military alliance and staging all sorts of war drills”.
Hours after the launch, Seoul’s Defence Ministry announced that South Korea, the United States and Japan conducted a combined aerial exercise above waters near South Korea’s Jeju island that involved at least one nuclear-capable US B-52 bomber.

North Korea says it fired new intermediate-range hypersonic missile,"North Korea said Wednesday that it test-fired the Hwasongpho-16B, a new intermediate-range solid-fueled ballistic missile with a hypersonic gliding warhead. Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, April 3 (UPI) -- North Korea successfully test-fired a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile, state media reported Wednesday, adding another nuclear-capable weapon to its expanding arsenal. State-run Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch of the new missile, dubbed the Hwasongpho-16B, on Tuesday. Advertisement
The weapon is a ""new-type intermediate-range solid-fueled ballistic missile loaded with newly-developed hypersonic gliding warhead,"" KCNA said.
Kim praised the development of ""another powerful strategic offensive weapon""' and said that the North's entire arsenal of missiles was now ""on solid-fueled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis.""
The developments present growing challenges for missile detection and interception systems. Missiles using solid-fuel propellants can be transported and launched more quickly than liquid-fuel models, while hypersonic weapons travel at least five times the speed of sound and are maneuverable mid-flight.
A hypersonic missile was on a wish list of weapons that Kim laid out at a party congress in January 2021, alongside nuclear-powered submarines, submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, ""ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons"" and military satellites.
Intermediate-range missiles tipped with nuclear warheads could place U.S. military installations in Guam -- around 2,100 miles away -- within reach.

South Korea's military announced Tuesday that it had detected the launch, saying the missile flew around 375 miles and splashed down in the East Sea.
According to the KCNA report, the new missile's hypersonic glide warhead reached a peak height of 62 miles and flew about 620 miles while conducting maneuvers before hitting a target in the sea.
The launch was the North's third ballistic missile of the year among a range of weapons tests and heated rhetoric that has kept tensions ratcheted up on the Korean Peninsula. It comes amid growing military ties between North Korea and Russia, with evidence that Moscow is sharing advanced weapons technology and helping Pyongyang evade sanctions in exchange for munitions.
The United States, South Korea and Japan have increased their military cooperation in response to the North's provocations, with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets to the Peninsula.
On Tuesday, the three allies conducted a combined aerial exercise involving nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bombers hours after the North's missile launch.
The drills were held to ""improve our deterrence and response capabilities to North Korea's increasingly advanced nuclear and missile threats,"" South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a statement.",2024-04-03T03:11:49Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

The North had also tested a purported hypersonic IRBM in January, which came years after it flight-tested liquid-fuel IRBMs. Experts say such weapons if perfected is potentially capable of reaching remote U.S. targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons.
The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
While supervising Tuesday’s test, Kim called for his country to further expand its nuclear and missile program to acquire “overwhelming power capable of containing and controlling” his enemies, who have “recently run higher fever in boosting their military alliance and staging all sorts of war drills.”

North Korea says it test-fired new solid-fuel hypersonic missile,"North Korea successfully test-fired a new mid- to long-range solid-fuel, hypersonic missile, state media KCNA said on Wednesday.
North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Tuesday in a possible test, drawing swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch, KCNA said, lauding it as a strategic weapon that demonstrates the “absolute superiority” of North Korea’s defence technology.
With this, North Korea has “fully turned all tactical, operational, and strategic-grade missiles of different ranges into solid-fuel, with warhead control, and capable of nuclearization,” Kim said, according to KCNA.
Hypersonic missiles are more difficult to intercept, while missiles with solid fuel can be moved and stored more easily, meaning they can be ready to launch at short notice.
Tuesday’s test followed a ground test in late March of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile.
Britain also condemned North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch on Tuesday, saying it breached multiple UN Security Council resolutions.
Meanwhile, a North Korean diplomatic delegation that visited China, Vietnam and Laos, as well as an economic delegation to Russia, have all returned home on Tuesday, KCNA said.",2024-04-02T22:20:40Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail
Nord-Korea: Vellykket prøveoppskyting av ny hypersonisk rakett,"Nord-Korea melder onsdag at landet har gjennomført en vellykket prøveoppskytning av en ny hypersonisk rakett.
Det dreier seg ifølge nyhetsbyrået Yonhap om en mellom- til langdistanserakett.
Tirsdag meldte sørkoreanske og japanske myndigheter at Nord-Korea hadde skutt opp en ballistisk rakett. Ifølge det sørkoreanske forsvaret skjedde oppskytningen på østkysten.
Den japanske kystvakten opplyste at et prosjektil trolig er en ballistisk rakett fra Nord-Korea. Den skal ha havnet i sjøen.
Oppskytningen føyde seg inn i rekken av våpentester som har hevet spenningen i regionen. Dette var den første kjente oppskytningen siden 18. mars. Da var Nord-Koreas leder Kim Jong-un til stede under en øvelse med artillerisystemer som skal kunne nå Sør-Koreas hovedstad Seoul.

North Korea’s Kim Jong Un leads test of new missile that can hit US bases,"SEOUL – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test of a new ballistic missile designed to deploy a hypersonic glide vehicle that can deliver a nuclear payload, his state media reported, calling the test “an epoch-making success”.
Mr Kim’s propaganda apparatus on April 3 lauded the launch of the missile that took place a day earlier, which it said was of intermediate range – meaning it could hit US military bases in the region.
The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea and Japan, as well as the US.
It remains to be seen if North Korea has actually developed a functional hypersonic glide vehicle. These weapons are designed to deploy a re-entry vehicle for carrying a nuclear warhead that can change its flight path at high speeds, making it hard for interceptors to shoot down.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the launch probably focused on testing the missile’s flight performance in the early stage of development, an area in which North Korea appeared to have made partial progress.
But it “exaggerated” several specifications, from flight range to a delay in igniting the second-stage engine and quickly changing flight orbit, the JCS said.
The missile launched on April 2 flew about 600km, it said, and appeared to be related to a new engine for a hypersonic missile system that North Korea tested about a month ago.
State media showed images of the North Korean leader near the missile, dubbed the Hwasong-16B, prior to launch and the rocket flying in the air.
Mr Kim “has personally blazed the ceaseless untrodden path to developing and perfecting ultra-modern weapons with his unshakable will and inexhaustible energy”, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.
Analysts said it was unclear if the North would exclusively build solid-fuel missiles in the future, and what a switch would mean for its arsenal of liquid-fuel weapons, such as its largest Hwasong-17 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
North Korea may heavily favour solid-fuel systems where possible, but actually phasing out liquid-fuel weapons would likely only play out over years, said Mr Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
“There are obvious strategic advantages to an all-solid-fuel force for them in the form of greater promptness, responsiveness and survivability,” he added.
North Korea’s pursuit of hypersonic vehicles helps its broader effort to field warheads tougher to intercept.
Warheads typically launched by such missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200kmh, often manoeuvring at relatively low altitudes.
That manoeuvrability, not speed, is the most attractive feature of such weapons, analysts say, as the latter can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads.
The North has a habit of provocations that coincide with elections in South Korea, and the launch came before a vote for a new Parliament on April 10.
Mr Kim’s regime has bristled at the government of conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has taken a hard line on Pyongyang, and the latest launch serves as a reminder of the North’s threats to security.
North Korea last tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile in January.
A missile of this sort is built to fly far enough to hit all of Japan, where the US has tens of thousands of troops.
It can also reach US military facilities in Guam, where the Pentagon says it keeps one of America’s largest munitions depots in the world. BLOOMBERG",2024-04-02T21:32:15Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times

Last week, Kim Jong Un oversaw test-fire for an intermediate-range hypersonic missile.
North Korea for years has sought to develop more advanced hypersonic and solid-fuel technologies, to make its missiles more competitive against South Korean-US missile defence systems and to threaten America's regional military bases.
Analysts said North Korea's latest demonstration of technical improvements would potentially impact regional security.

"Korea Zinc agrees 40% fee cut to turn Teck's mined zinc into metal, sources say","Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual conference in Toronto
By Julian Luk and Joyce Lee
LONDON/SEOUL (Reuters) - Canadian miner Teck Resources has agreed to pay Korea Zinc $165 per metric ton, a three-year low, to turn its zinc concentrate into refined metal, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Known as treatment charges (TCs), the fees paid for converting raw materials into zinc metals fall when mine output decreases as smelters have to compete for concentrate.
Korea Zinc declined to comment. Teck Resources said it ""does not comment on commercial negotiations"".
Teck and Korea Zinc are major players in the market for zinc used to galvanise steel for the construction industry.

Their annual agreement on yearly processing charges that miners pay smelters, for supply from Teck's Red Dog mine in Alaska, is often used as a benchmark by the industry.
The fee Teck has agreed with Korea Zinc has dropped 40% from $274 per ton last year and is the lowest since 2021.
Low zinc prices in recent months have led to mine closures, including Boliden's Tara operation in Ireland. Major mines like Glencore's McArthur River zinc and lead mine in Australia also recently suspended operations due to extreme weather conditions.
Korea Zinc, the world's biggest producer of both zinc and lead, bulk buys concentrate for a group of smelters including Seokpo, operated by Young Poong Corp, this year.

Nuclear fusion reactor in South Korea runs at 100 million degrees C for a record-breaking 48 seconds,"South Korea's ""artificial sun"" has set a new fusion record after superheating a plasma loop to 180 million degrees Fahrenheit (100 million degrees Celsius) for 48 seconds, scientists have announced.
The Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) reactor broke the previous world record of 31 seconds, which was set by the same reactor in 2021.The breakthrough is a small but impressive step on the long road to a source of near-unlimited clean energy.
Scientists have been trying to harness the power of nuclear fusion — the process by which stars burn — for more than 70 years. By fusing hydrogen atoms to make helium under extremely high pressures and temperatures, so-called main-sequence stars convert matter into light and heat, generating enormous amounts of energy without producing greenhouse gases or long-lasting radioactive waste.
But replicating the conditions found inside the hearts of stars is no simple task. The most common design for fusion reactors — the tokamak — works by superheating plasma (one of the four states of matter, consisting of positive ions and negatively charged free electrons) and trapping it inside a donut-shaped reactor chamber with powerful magnetic fields.
Keeping the turbulent and superheated coils of plasma in place long enough for nuclear fusion to happen, however, has been a painstaking process. Soviet scientist Natan Yavlinsky designed the first tokamak in 1958, but no one has ever managed to create a reactor that is able to put out more energy than it takes in.

One of the main stumbling blocks has been how to handle a plasma that's hot enough to fuse. Fusion reactors require very high temperatures — many times hotter than the sun — because they have to operate at much lower pressures than where fusion naturally takes place inside the cores of stars. The core of the actual sun, for example, reaches temperatures of around 27 million F (15 million C) but has pressures roughly equal to 340 billion times the air pressure at sea level on Earth.

Cooking plasma to these temperatures is the relatively easy part, but finding a way to corral it so that it doesn't burn through the reactor without also ruining the fusion process is technically tricky. This is usually done either with lasers or magnetic fields.
To extend their plasma's burning time from the previous record-breaking run, the scientists tweaked aspects of their reactor's design, including replacing carbon with tungsten to improve the efficiency of the tokamak’s ""divertors,"" which extract heat and ash from the reactor.
""Despite being the first experiment run in the environment of the new tungsten divertors, thorough hardware testing and campaign preparation enabled us to achieve results surpassing those of previous KSTAR records in a short period,"" Si-Woo Yoon, the director of the KSTAR Research Center, said in a statement.
KSTAR scientists are aiming to push the reactor to sustain temperatures of 180 million F for 300 seconds by 2026.
The record joins others made by competing fusion reactors around the world, including one by the U.S. government-funded National Ignition Facility (NIF), which sparked headlines after the reactor core briefly put out more energy than was put into it.",2024-04-02T14:44:31Z,https://www.livescience.com,Livescience.com
North Korea Wants To Put 'Several' Spy Satellites Into Orbit This Year,"North Korea plans to follow up last year's launch of a spy satellite by putting several more in orbit by the end of this year, according to state media.
Pyongyang plans to make itself a ""space power,"" putting it on the fast track to economic and scientific prowess, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) wrote Monday in a report marking the 11th anniversary of North Korea's space industry.
The reclusive country successfully launched its first surveillance satellite, Malligyong-1, last November. The U.S. condemned the action as a breach of the United Nations Security Council resolutions aimed at limiting dual-use technology that could advance the Kim Jong Un regime's ballistic missile program.
The launch also set into motion a North-South tit-for-tat that further raised the temperature on the Korean Peninsula.
The report cited National Aerospace Technology Administration Deputy Director General Pak Kyong So as saying Malligyong-1 represented the progress the ruling Workers' Party of Korea has made toward strengthening national defense as part of the party's policy of conquering space.
He added that ""several"" more reconnaissance satellites are planned for this year.
""The development of the space industry is of great importance in the construction of a powerful socialist country in which the leap forward is firmly guaranteed by cutting-edge science and technology,"" he was quoted as saying.
The North Korean embassy in China did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
Doubts remained about the functionality of Malligyong-1 until February, when Marco Langbroek, aerospace engineering professor at the Netherlands' Delft University, reported a satellite station at Leiden, the Netherlands, had observed the spacecraft executing perigee burns to rise to a higher orbit.
""One thing we have seen is that both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea missile and space programs very quickly learn from failures, and we are now seeing them getting more and more successful,"" Langbroek told Newsweek.
""I have just completed an additional analysis that shows that all these small maneuvers were done at moments that the satellite passed over North Korea, and all around 10-11 p.m. local time. So control seems to be done from North Korea itself (i.e. not outsourced to China or Russia), likely from Pyongyang's General Satellite Control Center.""
He added that it ""makes sense they are going to try to launch more and gain more experience with that.""

Korean Central News Agency
The KCNA article followed last week's statement by South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung-jun that the North was already laying the groundwork for a new satellite launch, though he added there was no indication the launch was imminent.
After two prior attempts believed to be failures, North Korea said it put Malligyong-1 into orbit on November 21, 2023, in what the White House called a ""brazen violation"" of United Nations Security Council sanctions. North Korea said the move was necessary for self-defense.
Seoul responded by partially suspending a landmark 2018 defense agreement meant to reduce the risk of military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, prompting Pyongyang to drop the pact entirely, further intensifying the diplomatic freeze between the North and South.
In December, South Korea launched its own first spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, leading the North to decry the U.S.'s ""double standard.""",2024-04-02T11:57:12Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Tottenham fury as Son Heung-min 'legend' claim brutally shut down by former Chelsea star,"Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min is not a Premier League legend, according to former Chelsea and Aston Villa midfielder Andy Townsend.
Son arrived in England in August 2015, when Tottenham signed him from Bayer Leverkusen. The left winger, who can also play as a centre-forward, has gone on to enjoy a fantastic career in North London.
Son has scored 160 goals and registered a further 82 assists in 399 appearances for Tottenham. This season, he has managed 15 goals and eight assists in 26 league matches and is Tottenham’s top goalscorer.
The South Korean currently sits fifth on the list of Spurs’ all-time record scorers, with only Martin Chivers, Bobby Smith, Sir Jimmy Greaves and Harry Kane netting more goals for the club.
While Son has been a fantastic servant to Spurs, both he and Kane have been let down by the fact the club has not managed to win any silverware since 2008.
While Son and Kane are modern-day icons at Spurs, their lack of trophies holds them back when it comes to ranking some of the best players in the world, and indeed of all time.
DON’T MISS – Tottenham striker search: Dream signing, realistic options and perfect Postecoglou projects all assessed
Townsend, who won two League Cups with Villa and also made 124 appearances for Chelsea, does not believe Son can be called a ‘legend’ in the Premier League.
When asked on talkSPORT if winning more trophies would help Son’s cause, Townsend replied: “He is a top player, he’s a great; that word ‘legend’ should only be used in the right context.”
Son Heung-min a Spurs ‘great’ but not a Prem ‘legend’
Townsend jokingly added: “Someone put that on your script about me earlier and it’s not right.
“I think that Son has been a great player and great operator for Spurs, but a legend? No.”
Son will be aiming to prove Townsend and his other doubters wrong by helping Spurs win a trophy under Ange Postecoglou.
While that will not happen this season, as Spurs were knocked out of both the FA Cup and League Cup, Son and Postecoglou will be hoping to end the club’s curse next term.
The team has improved hugely this campaign and if they can make some more clever signings this summer it will give them a good chance of finally lifting some silverware.
Spurs could also feature in a European competition next season, as they currently sit in fifth spot in the Premier League, three points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with a game in hand.

Even if there is a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra you might not be able to buy it,"Will there be a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra? Or what about a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE? These are perhaps the biggest questions surrounding Samsung’s upcoming foldable phones, as we’ve seen leaks about both a super-premium Ultra model and a more affordable FE version, and there’s still uncertainty over whether one, both, or neither will actually launch.
The latest leak again points towards a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra being in the works, as GalaxyClub (via NotebookCheck) claims that Samsung is working on a device with the model number SM-F958.
Now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 has the model number SM-F946, and the last digit on Samsung’s Fold model numbers is always a 6 – so the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will most likely be the SM-F956.
So what about SM-F958? Well, the number ‘8’ is used at the end of model numbers for Samsung’s Ultra phones, with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for example having the model number SM-928.
So, with SM-F958 looking like a Z Fold model number, but with an 8 at the end, the logical assumption is that this is the rumored Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra.
Coming to a store not so near you
The bad news, however, is that you might not be able to buy this phone – and we don’t just mean because it’s sure to be out of most people’s reach price-wise.
You see, the complete model number spotted by GalaxyClub is actually SM-F958N, with that ‘N’ at the end denoting that it’s intended for South Korea. The site goes so far as to say that this South Korean model is the only version that “appears to be under development.”

Now, it’s entirely possible that GalaxyClub’s information is wrong or incomplete, so even if it’s right about the model numbers there could be variants planned for the rest of the world too. But it’s not impossible that Samsung would limit this phone to its home country, especially while testing the waters with the first generation of a foldable Ultra device.
We should also add that none of this precludes the possibility of a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold FE launching as well. It’s entirely possible that Samsung is working on both, and perhaps the more affordable FE will also be more widely available.
Leaks and past form suggest that the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be announced in late July, alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, so we might also see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra and/or FE then too – although we’ve heard elsewhere that if there is a Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE, it might land later, in September or October. Whatever, we’ll be sure to update you on all the news and leaks in the meantime.

US urges South Korea to tighten chip export curbs on China,"The U.S. wants South Korea to further restrict the export of advanced semiconductor technology and tools used for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, Bloomberg News reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. has asked South Korea to adopt similar export restrictions on China as it has. The move is part of Washington's efforts to impede the advance of China's semiconductor industry over national security concerns.
The potential curbs are aimed at including logic chips more advanced than 14-nanometer and a type of memory known as DRAM beyond 18nm. This would be consistent with a set of restrictions the U.S. Department of Commerce first announced in 2022, the report added.
U.S. officials and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government had discussed the issues in March. The U.S. intends to reach an agreement before a G7 summit in mid-June, however, the Asian nation is mulling the idea because China remains an important trading partner, according to the report.
Earlier this month, the U.S., reportedly, was urging its allies including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan to further tighten the export of semiconductor equipment, spare parts and chip chemicals to China.
However, this timeline could be disturbed as officials from South Korea, Japan and the U.S. intend to meet in late June to discuss cooperation on advanced technology and supply chains.
Last week, the Biden administration further updated its rules, making it difficult for China to access U.S. AI chips and chipmaking equipment, as part of its efforts to impede the advance of China's semiconductor industry over national security concerns.
The move did not go unnoticed by China, as on Monday it criticized the move noting that the restrictions created additional obstacles to trade and more uncertainty in the chip industry.
South Korea is worried about potential penalties China may impose in response to the export controls, as several tech companies, including Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, still operate in China, Seoul's biggest trading partner, the report added.
With support from Samsung and Hynix, South Korea makes some of the world's most advanced logic and memory chips. However, the country's chip equipment suppliers are not as prominent as the U.S.-based Applied Materials (AMAT) or Dutch company ASML (ASML), local gear manufacturers including Hanmi Semiconductor and Jusung Engineering still make up a vital part of the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.
Meanwhile, Nvidia's (NVDA) partner SK Hynix intends to invest about $4B to set up an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, according to a report from last month. The project is expected to get tax incentives and other types of support in the U.S.
South Korea is eyeing a multinational framework to review export controls for sensitive products such as semiconductor-related equipment, the country's trade minister Cheong Inkyo had said last month. This could complicate U.S. efforts to curb China's influence on technology supply chains. However, it would take months for South Korea to implement any curbs, the official noted, according to the report.",2024-04-02T09:26:52Z,https://seekingalpha.com,Seeking Alpha

Viaplay Ties With John De Mol‘s Talpa & Completes UK Biz Sale
Viaplay Group has entered into a linear partnership with John de Mol’s Talpa Network in the Netherlands and completed the sale of its UK business. Starting April 5, Talpa Network’s SBS9 linear TV channel will be rebranded as Viaplay TV, and will show selected content from the Viaplay streaming service’s portfolio of premium sports. Viaplay TV’s first live broadcast will be the second free practice session for the Japanese Grand Prix, featuring superstar Dutch driver Max Verstappen. In addition to selected live sports and reruns from Viaplay, Viaplay TV will feature Dutch and international series and films from Talpa Network’s entertainment offering. “Talpa Network is a well-established Dutch player with outstanding reach,” said Peter Nørrelund, Viaplay Group EVP and Chief Sports & Business Development Officer. “This partnership will showcase Viaplay’s premium sports portfolio, which is the most attractive and relevant anywhere in the Netherlands.” The move is reflective of Scandi outfit Viaplay’s new strategy to focus on core markets following an incredibly difficult 2023, during which around 30% of staffers were laid off. It comes as the sale of its UK business back to Premier Sports completes, having received final clearance from the Irish authorities. Last week, CEO Jørgen Madsen Lindemann vowed that the company will “be different” following huge 2023 losses, although turnover did increase. He said the “complexity of exiting” Viaplay’s non-core international markets was holding up several commercial deals and led to higher than expected losses.",2024-04-02T08:31:13Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline

Hyundai Motor met fin à un contrat d'approvisionnement en aluminium en Indonésie à la suite d'une campagne sur le climat menée par des fans de K-pop,"La société sud-coréenne Hyundai Motor Co et PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk ont mis fin à un accord de fourniture d'aluminium à la suite d'appels lancés par un militant pour le climat soutenu par des fans de K-pop à ne pas s'approvisionner en métal produit à partir d'énergie charbonnière.
Des millions de jeunes fans de K-pop ont parfois pesé de tout leur poids pour soutenir diverses campagnes mondiales et causes sociales, souvent par l'intermédiaire des médias sociaux.
Hyundai Motor a déclaré dans un communiqué mardi qu'il avait mis fin à son protocole d'accord non contraignant avec Adaro, une unité du deuxième plus grand mineur de charbon d'Indonésie, Adaro Energy Indonesia, à la fin de 2023, ajoutant que les entreprises avaient décidé d'explorer d'autres opportunités de manière indépendante.
Wito Krisnahadi, directeur de PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia, a également confirmé que les entreprises avaient décidé de ne pas renouveler l'accord après son expiration.
Le constructeur automobile sud-coréen a signé le protocole d'accord avec Adaro Minerals en 2022 pour s'assurer le droit d'acheter l'aluminium produit par la filiale d'Adaro, PT Kalimantan Aluminium Industry.
Au moment de la signature, Hyundai a déclaré qu'elle espérait obtenir d'Adaro de l'aluminium répondant à la politique de neutralisation du carbone du constructeur automobile, dans un contexte de demande croissante d'aluminium de la part des constructeurs automobiles mondiaux.
La fonte de l'aluminium nécessite d'énormes quantités d'énergie et, lorsqu'elle utilise du charbon, produit d'importants volumes d'émissions de carbone.
Adaro prévoit d'alimenter la troisième phase de son projet de fonderie d'aluminium avec une centrale hydroélectrique que son groupe est en train de construire.
Le groupe d'activistes climatiques Kpop4Planet, qui avait demandé la fin de l'accord sur l'aluminium de Hyundai, a salué la décision du constructeur automobile.

Radio Free Asia, a U.S.-government funded broadcast and online news operation, has closed its editorial office in Hong Kong. The company said on Friday that it has shut down its bureau as a reaction to the new Article 23 National Security Law which came into effect on March 23. RFA will keep its media registration in the city.
The law, which is addition to the National Security Law injected into Hong Kong’s mini constitution in July 2020, imposes severe punishments for interference by foreign forces deemed to threaten national security and criminalizes the possession or disclosure of state secrets. These can include economic and social issues. It also criminalizes sedition.
The Hong Kong government has criticized RFA, the BBC and other news organizations for their reporting about the new law. It says that it was its constitutional duty to enact the new law, rejects claims that Article 23 restricts personal freedoms or is substantially different from security laws in other developed territories.

North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile,"North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Tuesday in a possible test of a new rocket using solid fuel, drawing swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States. South Korea's military said it detected what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from an area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Tuesday at 6:53 a.m. (2153 GMT on Monday) before plunging into the sea off the east coast.
It flew about 600 km (372 miles) before falling into sea, South Korea said, while Japan's defence ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650 km (400 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 100 km (62 miles). South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile or what type of warhead it may have carried, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said the launch was probably ""related"" to the testing of a recent solid-fuel engine. In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch as damaging for regional and international peace and stability. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the event did not pose an immediate danger to its troops or allies but condemned it as an unlawful and destabilizing act.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North could try to sow confusion in his country ahead of a parliamentary election this month. He said such an attempt would be futile and that the response to any North Korean aggression would be firm. U.S. B-52 BOMBER JOINS DRILLS
Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation. On Tuesday, aircraft from the three countries conducted air drills that involved a U.S. B-52H strategic bomber to enhance deterrence and counter capabilities against missile and nuclear threats from the North, South Korea said.
Officials in the United States, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations. South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the United States government is arranging a summit between President Joe Biden and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in July on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington, Japanese media outlets reported.

North Korea just test-fired a ballistic missile in the Sea of Japan; Here's a look at how dangerous they are,"These missiles are capable of carrying conventional warheads, such as TNT. They can also carry non-conventional warheads, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons
North Korea reportedly test-fired an intermediate range ballistic missile in the Sea of Japan. Source: AP
South Korea on Tuesday said that neighbouring North Korea had test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). According to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
It flew roughly 600 kilometres and landed in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Here’s a look at what ballistic missiles are and how much of a threat they pose.
What are ballistic missiles?
Ballistic missiles are projectiles that are powered by rocket engine(s) until they reach the highest point in their trajectory. From then on, it follows an unpowered trajectory, arching upwards before falling (due to the earth’s gravity) to reach its target.
How dangerous are ballistic missiles?
These missiles are capable of carrying conventional warheads, such as TNT. They can also carry non-conventional warheads, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
They can deliver these payloads at high speed and over great distances. In fact, warheads delivered by these missiles can travel at speeds of 3,200 kilometres per hour right before impact.

Types of ballistic missiles
Ballistic missiles can be classified on the basis of the distances they can travel. According to this classification, there are four kinds of ballistic missiles:
Short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs): Also known as “tactical” ballistic missiles, SRBMs travel less than 1,000 kms.
Medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs): They travel between 1,000 and 3,000 kms. These are also sometimes referred to as “theatre” ballistic missiles.
Intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs): These travel between 3,000 and 5,500 kms. South Korea says that the one test-fired by North Korea on Tuesday was an IRBM.
Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs): This long-range ballistic missile is capable of hitting targets that are over 5,500 kms away from the launch point.
North Korea’s IRBMs
According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Pyongyang has two IRBMs:
Hwasong-12: Also known as KN-17, this missile is believed to have a range of 2,000-4,500 kms. It can carry a single warhead weighing upto 500 kilograms. It was first successfully tested in May 2017. North Korea has flight tested the Hwasong-12 at least seven times, achieving four successful flights and three failures. It is unclear if North Korea has operationally deployed the missile.

BM-25 Musudan: This IRBM is also known as Hwasong-10, Mirim, and Nodong B, BM-25. It is believed to have a range of 2,500 – 4,000 kms, and can carry a payload weighing 500 – 1,200 kgs. BM-25 Musudan could pose a risk to Japan as well as Guam, an unincorporated territory of the United States.

"What are solid-fuel missiles, and why is North Korea developing them?","SEOUL - North Korea launched a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) on April 2, in what South Korean officials said could be related to its development of a new solid-fuel hypersonic weapon.
The launch comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported in March.
In January, North Korea test-fired an IRBM that it said was equipped with a hypersonic manoeuvrable controlled warhead. State media did not immediately disclose details of April 2’s launch.
Here are some characteristics of solid-fuel technology, and how it can help the nuclear-armed North improve its missile systems:
What are some advantages of solid fuel?
Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fuelled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate, and require less logistical support, making them harder to detect and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons.
“These capabilities are much more responsive in a time of crisis,” said Mr Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
What is solid-fuel technology?
Solid propellants are a mixture of fuel and oxidiser. Metallic powders such as aluminium often serve as the fuel, and ammonium perchlorate, which is the salt of perchloric acid and ammonia, is the most common oxidiser.
The fuel and oxidiser are bound together by a hard, rubbery material and packed into a metal casing.
When solid propellant burns, oxygen from the ammonium perchlorate combines with aluminium to generate enormous amounts of energy and temperatures of more than 2,760 deg C, creating thrust and lifting the missile from the launch pad.
Who has that technology?
Solid fuel dates back to fireworks developed by the Chinese centuries ago, but made dramatic progress in the mid-20th century, when the US developed more powerful propellants.
North Korea uses solid fuel in a range of small, shorter-range ballistic missiles, as well as in its new Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
The Soviet Union fielded its first solid-fuel ICBM, the RT-2, in the early 1970s, followed by France’s development of its S3, also known as SSBS, a medium-range ballistic missile.
China started testing solid-fuel ICBMs in the late 1990s.
South Korea has also said it has secured “efficient and advanced” solid-propellant ballistic missile technology, though in much smaller rockets so far.
Solid v liquid
Liquid propellants provide greater propulsive thrust and power, but require more complex technology and extra weight.
Solid fuel is dense and burns quite quickly, generating thrust over a short time. Solid fuel can remain in storage for an extended period without degrading or breaking down – a common issue with liquid fuel.
North Korea said the development of its solid-fuel ICBM, the Hwasong-18, would “radically promote” its nuclear counter-attack capability.
After the first launch South Korea’s Defence Ministry sought to downplay the testing, saying the North would need “extra time and effort” to master the technology. REUTERS",2024-04-02T06:30:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times

In South Korea, the Kospi edged 0.1% higher to 2,750.63 after data showed the country’s consumer prices rose 3.1% in March compared to the same period last year, matching the previous month’s pace.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained less than 0.1% to 7,900.50, despite its manufacturing sector index contracting to 47.3 in March from 47.8 in February, its fastest pace since May 2020.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 dipped 0.2% from its all-time high to finish at 5,243.77 on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% from its record to 39,566.85. The Nasdaq composite was an outlier and added 0.1% to 16,396.83.

In the bond market, Treasury yields spurted higher after a report said U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly returned to growth last month. It snapped a 16-month run of contraction, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
It's the latest evidence showing the U.S. economy remains strong despite high interest rates. That's a positive for the stock market because it can drive growth in profits for companies. But it can also keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could mean a more hesitant Federal Reserve when it comes to the cuts to interest rates that investors crave.
Following the manufacturing data, traders on Wall Street briefly trimmed bets on the first cut to rates coming as soon as June. That's still a “reasonable baseline"" expectation, according to Deutsche Bank economists, but they say tough talk from Fed officials recently could hint at interest rates staying higher for longer than earlier thought.
The Fed has hiked its main rate to the highest level since 2001 in order to slow the economy and depress investment prices enough to get inflation under control. Expectations for coming cuts have been a major reason the S&P 500 soared more than 20% from October through March.
This week will offer several economic reports that could sway the Fed's thinking, including updates on job openings across the country and the strength of U.S. services businesses. The headliner arrives on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that hiring cooled a bit last month.
A slowdown would be welcome on Wall Street, where the hope is that the economy remains solid but not so strong that it pushes inflation higher. Inflation is milder than it was at its peak nearly two years ago. But progress has become bumpier recently, with reports this year coming in hotter than expected.

Following the manufacturing data, traders on Wall Street briefly trimmed bets on the first cut to rates coming as soon as June. That's still a “reasonable baseline"" expectation, according to Deutsche Bank economists, but they say tough talk from Fed officials recently could hint at interest rates staying higher for longer than earlier thought.
The Fed has hiked its main rate to the highest level since 2001 in order to slow the economy and depress investment prices enough to get inflation under control. Expectations for coming cuts have been a major reason the S&P 500 soared more than 20% from October through March.

This week will offer several economic reports that could sway the Fed's thinking, including updates on job openings across the country and the strength of U.S. services businesses. The headliner arrives on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that hiring cooled a bit last month.
A slowdown would be welcome on Wall Street, where the hope is that the economy remains solid but not so strong that it pushes inflation higher. Inflation is milder than it was at its peak nearly two years ago. But progress has become bumpier recently, with reports this year coming in hotter than expected.

North Korea fires medium-range ballistic missile,"SEOUL: North Korea fired a medium-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, Seoul's military said, the latest in a spate of banned weapons tests by Kim Jong Un's regime this year.
Tuesday's launch was the third ballistic missile test of 2024, after a solid-fuel one overseen by Kim in March and another tipped with a maneuverable hypersonic warhead in January.
It also comes less than two weeks after Kim supervised an engine test for a ""new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,"" according to North Korean state media, which has also said he oversaw ""super large"" rocket launcher drills and tank exercises this year.
Seoul's military ""detected around 06:53 (2153 GMT) what is presumed to be a medium-range ballistic missile fired from Pyongyang area into the East Sea,"" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
The missile flew about 600 kilometers (373 miles) before splashing down, the JCS said, adding it had ""stepped up monitoring and are closely sharing relevant information with the US and Japan.""

""We strongly condemn the North's blatant provocation that threatens peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,"" it added.
Tokyo confirmed the missile launch, with its coastguard urging vessels to be vigilant and report any fallen objects without approaching them.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the missile appeared ""to have fallen in waters outside Japan's exclusive economic zone.""
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the North had ""repeatedly launched ballistic missiles"" this year, adding that it was a threat to regional security and ""absolutely unacceptable.""
Tuesday's launch likely involved a hypersonic warhead, a Seoul military official told the Yonhap news agency.
""North Korea appears to have put a hypersonic warhead on top of the delivery system used in the engine test last month,"" the official said.

He added that while the missile flew for ""less than 10 minutes,"" its speed was similar to that of a hypersonic model.
Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds of at least Mach 5 — five times the speed of sound — and can maneuver mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.
Depending on their design, they can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads.
The launch comes just days after a Russian veto at the United Nations ended UN expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations, amid a probe into alleged arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.

North Korea has yet to comment on the development.
It also comes just over a week before South Korea votes in a general election, in which the party of hawkish President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a tough line with Pyongyang, is seeking to win back control of the parliament.

Sanctions monitoring?
""The Kim regime prioritizes advancing its military capabilities and doesn't care to stay quiet during the South Korean legislative election campaign,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

""But firing an intermediate-range missile lacks the shock value of a full-range ICBM launch or a nuclear test, so it's unlikely to swing any National Assembly seats.""
Pyongyang has been under a raft of sanctions since its second nuclear test in 2009, but the development of its nuclear and weapons programs has continued unabated.
So far this year, the nuclear-armed North has declared South Korea its ""principal enemy,"" jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over ""even 0.001 mm"" of territorial infringement.
The Tuesday launch ""appears to be part of Pyongyang's missile development blueprint, including hypersonic weapons,"" said Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies.

It seems Kim is developing such technology domestically, rather than with Russian help ""given the sensitive nature of the weapons,"" he added.
Pyongyang has recently boosted ties with traditional ally Russia.
In September last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim held a summit in Russia's far east, during which Kim declared that ties with Moscow were his country's ""number one priority"".
The United States subsequently claimed Pyongyang had begun providing Moscow with weapons.

Korean Fusion Reactor Sets New Record For Sustaining 100 Million Degree Plasma,"Upgrades to Korea's 'artificial Sun' fusion reactor have produced another record-breaking result, with new components able to better withstand blistering temperatures and sustain a swirling ball of 100 million-degree plasma for almost 50 seconds.
It's a leap of close to 20 seconds from the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research reactor (KSTAR), which has been smashing its own records in recent years for how long it can generate and contain insanely hot plasma in its donut-shaped hull.
At 100 million degrees Celsius, heavy hydrogen isotopes in the plasma (a hot cloud of ionized gas) are forced to fuse together, releasing energy in a fashion that's similar to what's happening in the Sun's core. However, the challenge for nuclear fusion – which promises cleaner, near-limitless energy – is to contain this writhing loop of plasma using magnetic fields.
KSTAR's latest result is impressive because it confronts some key challenges in the road to fusion power, although other fusion reactors in the same class of technology have pushed the limits further.
By test-driving the new components, KSTAR is paving the way for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) – which could be the world's largest tokamak fusion reactor if it can overcome budget blow-outs and technical hurdles.
KSTAR's new record – announced by the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE) last week – stems from upgrades made in 2023 to the reactor's divertor, a component that handles the hottest temperatures inside the reactor while funneling waste products away.
KSTAR's divertor is now made of tungsten, which has a very high melting point but doesn't absorb the plasma fuel like a sponge or react with it the way the previous carbon-based divertors would.
Installation of the new divertors was completed last year, helping to extend KSTAR's record fusion time to 48 seconds in its latest 3-month run, up from half a minute in 2021.
""Despite being the first experiment run in the environment of the new tungsten divertors, thorough hardware testing and campaign preparation enabled us to achieve results surpassing those of previous KSTAR records in a short period,"" Si-Woo Yoon, director of the KSTAR Research Center, explained in a statement.
However, the divertor's performance at temperatures seven times that of the Sun had to be proven; it was by no means a sure thing.
The KFE researchers expected it to perform much like a carbon-based divertor, but there was a risk the tungsten could shatter or that the new set-up would fail to generate plasma. Not only had the material of the divertor changed, but also its shape.
""At the beginning of the campaign, the temperature of the inner wall of the tokamak did not rise well,"" says KFE physicist Hyunseok Kim, but the researchers were able to quickly adjust to the new operating conditions to wrangle the plasma with magnetic fields.
The tungsten divertor wasn't the only upgrade helping to improve KSTAR's performance, either. KFE researchers, collaborating with the US Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and writing in Nature Communications in February, described how they found a way to stabilize weaknesses at the edge of the plasma caused by minuscule defects in the magnetic coils that hold the plasma in place.
The improvement led to a second milestone – containing plasma in a highly-efficient state called a high-confinement or 'H-mode' for 102 seconds. Previous attempts were limited to a few seconds before performance dipped dramatically.
Ideally, a fully operational fusion power station would operate at critical temperatures in H-mode for periods long enough to generate a sustainable source of energy. These achievements represent a monumental step towards this goal.
Hyeon-seon Han, a plasma physicist in KFE's High-Performance Scenario Research Team, says the team are currently reviewing this latest batch of experimental data, which will feed into ITER's preparations, assembling their results for publication, and planning their next campaign.
Han hopes that soon they can break through the 50-second mark on their way to the project's ultimate goal of achieving 300 seconds of plasma operation with temperatures over 100 million degrees by the end of 2026.
That's six times longer than KSTAR's current record, and still minutes shorter than China's Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) reactor, which as of April last year, could generate and sustain plasma for almost seven minutes.
But it takes massive amounts of energy to power up fusion reactors and generate plasma reactions for even a few seconds – so their ability to generate plentiful clean energy is still several decades away.",2024-04-02T06:11:14Z,https://www.sciencealert.com,ScienceAlert
South Korea says North Korea fired missile into its eastern waters,"A news programme airs a file image of a missile launch by North Korea at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea on Tuesday. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP
North Korea on Tuesday test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile towards waters off its eastern coast, South Korea’s military said.
South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, but it did not immediately confirm how far the weapon flew.
The North had said last month that it tested a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile, which, if perfected, could reach the US Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18th, when leader Kim Jong-Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.

Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment from the country’s defence ministry stating that the missile had already landed but urging caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile has been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security”.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen since 2022 as Mr Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons.
The US and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets. There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the US and South Korea.
Following the March 19th test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Mr Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time. Mr Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm its adversaries’ missile defence systems.
In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic, manoeuvrable warhead, which came after it tested a solid-fuel IRBM engine for the first time in November.
Other weapons North Korea have tested this year include cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at the Seoul capital area.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions.
South Korea’s military said on Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the north-west.
Mr Kim has described satellites as crucial for monitoring US and South Korean military movements and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles.
Last November, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit for the first time, drawing condemnations from the US, South Korea, Japan and others, which view the launch as a cover for testing the North’s long-range missile technology.
North Korea has argued it has the sovereign right to launch spy satellites. - AP",2024-04-02T05:54:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times
Seoul says Pyongyang launched ballistic missile towards Sea of Japan,"Near the US-Canada border in Burlington, Vermont, which is set to experience the totality just before 3:30 pm (1930 GMT), many hotels have been sold out for months.
The few remaining rooms, which typically go for around $150 a night, show online prices of $600-$700 for the night of the eclipse.
""I don't know that we'll have anything quite like this again,"" Jeff Lawson, a vice president in the chamber of commerce, told AFP.
Lawson marveled at his city's ""incredible luck"" at an opportunity ""quite literally falling out of the sky into your lap.""
If skies are clear, the small city of 40,000 could see its population double for the day, with visitors arriving by car, train and even private jet, Lawson said.
An estimated 32 million people live inside the ""path of totality"" -- under which the Moon will fully block out the Sun -- with an additional 150 million residing less than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from the strip, NASA says.
- Traffic jams -
Preparations for the big day began years ago, Matt Bruning of the Ohio Department of Transportation told AFP.
He said the agency reached out to counterparts along the last major US eclipse, in 2017, and ""one of the things that we heard resoundingly was it's never too early to start planning.""
Despite those efforts, there will inevitably ""be delays, there will be heavy congestion,"" he warned.
Businesses are leaping into the bonanza with special events and in Cleveland, where local officials expect some 200,000 visitors, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame plans a four-day ""Solarfest"" of live music.
The Perryman Group, a Texas-based research firm, estimates direct and indirect economic impacts of this year's eclipse could reach $6 billion.
This year's path of totality is about 115 miles wide, wider than in 2017. It begins in western Mexico, arches up through the US cities of Dallas, Indianapolis, and Buffalo, before ending in eastern Canada.
Many schools along the path will be closed or letting students out early, including in Cleveland and Montreal.
Several airlines have advertised flights scheduled to pass under the eclipse, while Delta has even planned two special trips along the path of totality, the first of which sold out in 24 hours, the company said.
NASA warns that only in the path of totality -- and only during the few minutes of the actual totality -- is it safe to look at the eclipse without eye protection.
- 'Cosmic coincidence' -
Almost all of the United States will get to experience a partial eclipse, but UCLA astronomer Jean-Luc Margot says the trip to see the totality is definitely worth the hassle.
""If you have a 99 percent partial eclipse, that is a completely different experience than being in the path of totality,"" he told AFP.
He will be accompanying a group of UCLA alumni to view the eclipse in rural Texas, after similar trips in 2017 to Oregon and to Chile in 2019.
When people finally see the eclipse, they ""tend to be emotional,"" Margot said.
""It is such a beautiful event. It's due to this complete cosmic coincidence, that the angular size of the Sun and the angular size of the Moon are about the same.""
Scientists have traditionally used the eclipses to observe the solar corona, an outer layer of plasma that's difficult to study due to the Sun's bright light, Margot said.
New tools such as the space-based Parker Solar Probe have made such research less eclipse-dependent, but scientists will still be taking full advantage.
NASA recently highlighted several studies being planned for the eclipse, from effects on Earth's atmosphere and animal behavior to even human psychology.
""Eclipses have a special power,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said recently.
""They move people to feel a kind of reverence for the beauty of our universe.""",2024-04-02T05:52:57Z,https://www.rawstory.com,Raw Story
Japan approves $3.9 billion in subsidies to domestic chip maker Rapidus,"Japan said Tuesday it has approved up to 590 billion yen ($3.89 billion) in additional subsidies for chipmaker Rapidus Corporation, as the country plays catch up with other nations on semiconductor manufacturing.
The latest round of support will include up to 53.5 billion yen for research and development of back-end processes such as chip packaging, according to a press briefing by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on Tuesday.
Rapidus Corporation was founded in 2022 by the Japanese government and eight domestic companies to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Toyota Motor Corporation, Sony Group are among the companies that have invested billions of yen in Rapidus.
Rapidus has received 330 billion yen from the Japanese government between 2022 and 2023 to mass produce 2-nanometer chips in Chitose, Hokkaido, from 2027.
It will compete with industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, which plan to start mass production of 2-nanometer chips by 2025.
TSMC and Samsung currently produce 3-nanometer chips, while Rapidus is currently constructing an advanced semiconductor plant in Chitose.
Typically, a reduction in nanometer size can yield more powerful and efficient chips with more transistors packed onto a single semiconductor.
Rapidus said in April 2023 its workers had begun research and development in collaboration with IBM.",2024-04-02T04:32:42Z,https://www.cnbc.com,CNBC
"North Korea tests missile, Seoul says, ahead of vote seen as gauge of support for hardline South Korean leader","Seoul, South Korea CNN —
North Korea test-fired a presumed intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, its latest military maneuver since leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year declaration that he was ending a policy seeking reconciliation with the South.
Pyongyang made no immediate comment on the suspected test, which comes just over a week before key legislative elections in South Korea that will provide a barometer of support for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line against the North during his two years in office.
North Korea, which has faced years of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, has ramped up its weapons tests and military exercises in recent weeks.
On March 19, Pyongyang said it had tested a multistage, solid-fueled rocket engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Kim said after that test the development of the IRBM system was as important to North Korea’s security as its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which in theory could reach the United States mainland.
The KCNA report on the engine test did not give further details of the new hypersonic weapon, but North Korea has previously said it tested a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).
While all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic velocity – five to 10 times the speed of sound – in their terminal phase, an HGV can maneuver at high speeds as it nears a target, enabling it to evade detection and missile defenses.

Meanwhile, North Korea’s military has staged a series of military exercises in the past few months as the US and South Korea also held drills, including their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which South Korea said focused on deterring the North’s nuclear threat.
Pyongyang’s shows of power included long-range artillery and multiple rocket launchers, which pose a threat to the South Korean capital Seoul and other key areas near the border.
Ahead of the April 10 vote, some polls show President Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) widely trailing the opposition Democratic Party – and a loss for the PPP could be seen to weaken Yoon’s leadership, analysts say.
Yoon, who has pushed for increased military cooperation with the US, also backs closer ties with Korea’s former colonial ruler Japan, angering many in a country where the scars of that occupation remain prominent.
But Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Tuesday’s suspected missile test by North Korea won’t have much effect on the vote.

"Samsung likely to launch super app for financial services, working closely with South Korean banks","Samsung is not allowed to own a bank in South Korea. Consequently, the tech giant has had to go through a collaboration and leverage the infrastructure of an existing bank as its partner.

Although Samsung is involved in the financial sector in South Korea, they are not allowed to own a bank. Image Credit: Reuters
Having dominated everything tech for years, Samsung now wants to be a financial institution. The South Korean giant is now gearing up to make its mark in the commercial banking system in South Korea and quite possibly, other countries in Asia, with the launch of a new super app, if recent South Korean news reports are anything to go by.
Advertisement
The move signifies Samsung’s ambitious venture into financial services, through which it hopes to transform its existing financial app, Momino, into a comprehensive super app, similar to what we see in China’s WeChat platform.
The endeavour is led by Samsung Financial Networks, a division which includes the conglomerate’s four financial entities: Samsung Card, Samsung Life Insurance, Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, and Samsung Securities. A report by The Korea Economic Daily claims that Samsung is actively seeking collaboration with at least one prominent bank in South Korea to develop and deploy their new super app.
The report quotes sources, who opted to remain anonymous, revealing that Samsung has started an initial round of discussions with five leading banks, namely KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and the digital-exclusive K Bank.
These discussions revolve around Samsung’s proposal to enhance its existing Momino app into a multifunctional super app, offering various financial services ranging from money transfers to real estate and car price comparisons.

Sources also told The Korea Economic Daily that banks are supposed to meet with executives from Samsung on Tuesday where they are slated to present their proposals to Samsung. Furthermore, the decision on a potential partnership can be expected as early as Wednesday.
Despite its global stature and ownership of multiple financial affiliates, Samsung is barred from owning a bank in South Korea. Consequently, the tech giant has had to go for a collaborative approach and leverage the infrastructure of a banking partner while providing software support and integrating its financial services.

Samsung’s foray into the commercial banking sector signals a strategic shift aimed at diversifying its service portfolio and tapping into new revenue streams. With the impending launch of its super app, Samsung is poised to make substantial strides in reshaping the landscape of digital financial services in South Korea.

U.S. pushes South Korea to follow its lead and tighten export controls on chips for China,"The US is asking South Korea to adopt restrictions on semiconductor technology exports to China similar to those Washington has already implemented, another sign the Biden administration is stepping up efforts to thwart Beijing’s chip ambitions.
American officials want South Korea to restrict the flow of equipment and technologies for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include logic chips more advanced than 14-nanometer and a type of memory called DRAM beyond 18nm, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. That would be consistent with a set of measures the US Department of Commerce first announced in 2022.
American officials discussed the issues in depth with the government of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in March, the people said. While the US is trying to reach an agreement before a G7 summit in mid-June, Seoul officials are debating whether to satisfy the US request, in part because China remains a key trading partner.
Washington’s request of South Korea has not been detailed before. This comes on top of the new US push to get allies to limit servicing of semiconductor equipment for Chinese firms and restrict exports of spare parts and chip chemicals to China.
Bloomberg News has reported the US pressed allies, including South Korea and Germany, to tighten curbs on China’s access to their technology. Korea plays a leading role in producing semiconductors and providing spare parts for chip-making equipment.
The timeline could slip. South Korea, Japan and US officials are planning to meet in late June to discuss cooperation on advanced technology and supply chains, according to the people.
South Korean officials are wary of potential penalties that export controls may trigger from Beijing when major firms such as Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. still operate in China, Seoul’s largest trading partner.
The US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security did not respond to requests for comment. South Korea’s Trade Ministry declined to comment.
With help from Samsung and Hynix, South Korea makes some of the world’s most advanced logic and memory chips. While its chip equipment suppliers are not as prominent as the US’s Applied Materials Inc. or the Netherlands’ ASML Holding NV, local gear makers including Hanmi Semiconductor Co. and Jusung Engineering Co. still make up an important part of the Asian country’s semiconductor ecosystem.
South Korea has the biggest market share of memory chips in China and it is the second largest provider of silicon wafers for Chinese firms after Japan, according to a February report from the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. For chip-making materials and parts, South Korea is also the second largest exporter to China after Japan, the report said.
Meanwhile, South Korea is tapping into a multinational framework to review export controls for sensitive products like semiconductor-related equipment, the country’s trade minister Cheong Inkyo told reporters last month, an approach that may complicate US efforts to curtail China’s influence on technology supply chains. It will take months for South Korea to implement any curbs, the official added.",2024-04-02T04:00:00Z,https://fortune.com,Fortune
"North Korea fires an intermediate-range missile, South Korea says","SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast Tuesday, South Korea’s military said, as it pushes to advance its weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and flew about 372 miles before landing in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the launch most likely followed up on a North Korean test in March of a solid-fuel engine built for a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile it has been developing. If perfected, such weapons could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond, experts say.
Lee did not specify why the South Koreans were assessing the missile as an IRBM or whether it was flown at less than its capacity, but said the North Koreans were most likely experimenting with new warhead technologies.
Japan’s Defense Ministry gave more details in its assessment, saying the missile flew about 403 miles while reaching a maximum altitude of 62 miles before landing in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone. The Japanese military did not immediately say whether it assessed the missile as intermediate range or something else.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile had been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security.”
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
Following the March 19 test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods of time.
Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm his adversaries’ missile defense systems. Other weapons North Korea has tested this year include cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at Seoul, the capital of South Korea.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year. South Korea’s military said Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the northwest.
Kim has described satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military movements and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. Last November, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit for the first time.",2024-04-02T03:58:28Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News

SEOUL, April 2 (UPI) -- North Korea launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile into the East Sea Tuesday, South Korea's military said, the latest in a slew of weapons tests by the isolated regime this year. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters that it detected a projectile presumed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile fired from the Pyongyang area at 6:53 a.m. Advertisement
The missile flew around 375 miles before splashing down in the East Sea, the JCS said.
""Our military immediately detected, tracked and monitored the launch of a North Korean missile and closely shared related information with the U.S. and Japan,"" the JCS said. ""Detailed specifications are being comprehensively analyzed.""
Hawaii-based U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said it was aware of the launch and was consulting with South Korea and Japan.
""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" the command said in a statement, using the official name of North Korea. ""While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation.""

The launch was the North's third ballistic missile of the year among a range of weapons tests and heated rhetoric that has kept tensions ratcheted up on the Korean Peninsula.
On March 20, Pyongyang announced that it successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for a new type of hypersonic missile, and South Korean defense officials said that Tuesday's launch may have been a trial of the new delivery system.
""We believe [the launch] is related to the solid-fuel ground test that North Korea publicly reported in March,"" JCS spokesman Col. Lee Sung-jun said at a press briefing.
Hypersonic weapons travel at least five times the speed of sound and are designed to be maneuverable, making them difficult to intercept. In January, Pyongyang said it test-fired a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with a hypersonic warhead, which could place U.S. military installations in Guam -- around 2,100 miles away -- within reach.
Lee said Tuesday's launch showed ""some similarities and some differences"" with the January test and added that further analysis was required.
""There is a possibility that the launch vehicle's capabilities have been enhanced,"" he said.
A hypersonic missile was among a wish list of weapons that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un laid out at a party congress in January 2021, alongside nuclear-powered submarines, submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, ""ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons"" and military satellites.

On Monday, a North Korean official announced that Pyongyang planned to place several spy satellites into orbit this year.
Tuesday's launch comes amid growing military ties between North Korea and Russia, with evidence that Moscow is sharing advanced weapons technology and helping Pyongyang evade sanctions in exchange for munitions. Russia last week used its veto power to end a U.N. Security Council group that monitors sanctions violations by the North.
It also comes about a week ahead of the April 10 general election in South Korea, which defense officials have said may be a target for further provocations from the North.
""Further analysis is needed for [another intermediate-range ballistic missile] launch in the run-up to the general election,"" Lee said. ""There is also a possibility of additional missile launches and the launch of a space launch vehicle from [satellite facility] Tongchang-ri in the future, and we are keeping a close eye on it.

"North Korea fires medium-range ballistic missile, says Seoul military","The ballistic missile test on Tuesday was the third of 2024, following a solid-fuel test under Kim’s supervision in March and a test with a manoeuvrable hypersonic warhead in January
People stand next to a television screen showing a news broadcast with file footage of a North Korean missile test, at a railway station in Seoul. AFP
The military in Seoul said that North Korea launched a medium-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, the most recent in a string of prohibited weapon tests conducted by Kim Jong Un’s government this year.
The ballistic missile test on Tuesday was the third of 2024, following a solid-fuel test under Kim’s supervision in March and a test with a manoeuvrable hypersonic warhead in January.

It also coincides with less than two weeks after North Korean state media said that Kim oversaw tank training and “super large” rocket launcher drills this year, in addition to supervising an engine test for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile”.
Seoul’s military “detected around 06:53 (2153 GMT) what is presumed to be a medium-range ballistic missile fired from Pyongyang area into the East Sea,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
“We have stepped up monitoring and are closely sharing relevant information with the US and Japan,” they added.
Tokyo confirmed the missile launch, with the coastguard urging vessels to be vigilant and report any fallen objects without approaching them.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the missile “appears to have fallen in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone”.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the North had “repeatedly launched ballistic missiles” this year, adding that it was a threat to regional security and “absolutely unacceptable.”
The launch comes just days after a Russian veto at the United Nations ended UN expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations, amid a probe into alleged arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.

North Korea has yet to comment on the development.
It also comes just over a week before South Korea votes in a general election, in which the party of hawkish President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a tough line with Pyongyang, is seeking to win back control of the parliament.
Sanctions monitoring?

Pyongyang has been under a raft of sanctions since its second nuclear test in 2009, but the development of its nuclear and weapons programmes has continued unabated.
So far this year, the nuclear-armed North has declared South Korea its “principal enemy”, jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement.

Last month, the United States and South Korea staged one of their major annual joint military exercises, prompting angry retorts and live-fire drills from nuclear-armed Pyongyang, which condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion.
Seoul is one of Washington’s key regional allies, and the United States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South to help protect it against North Korea.
Pyongyang has recently boosted ties with traditional ally Russia.
In September last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim held a summit in Russia’s far east, during which Kim declared that ties with Moscow were his country’s “number one priority”.
The United States subsequently claimed Pyongyang had begun providing Moscow with weapons.
And South Korea asserted earlier this month that North Korea had shipped around 7,000 containers of arms to Russia for its war with Ukraine since the transfers began around last July.",2024-04-02T02:41:54Z,https://www.firstpost.com,Firstpost
North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile,"North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Tuesday, South Korea's military said, in a move that sparked immediate condemnation from the prime minister of Japan. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it detected the launch of what appeared to be a ballistic missile of an intermediate-range class from the area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Tuesday at 0653 a.m. (2153 GMT on Monday).
It flew about 600 kms (372 miles) before falling into sea, South Korea said, while Japan's defence ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650 km (400 miles) and hit a maximum altitude of 100 km (62 miles). The statement from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.
In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported. Japan said the missile appeared to have fallen outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation. Officials in the United States, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations.
South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea for Tuesday's missile launch that affected the peace and stability of the region, he told reporters.
North Korea recently said it had no interest in a summit with Japan and would reject any talks, potentially worsening already-hostile relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, the United States government is arranging a summit between President Joe Biden and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in July on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington, Japanese media outlets reported.

South Korea says North Korea has test-fired a missile into its eastern waters,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military says it has detected that North Korea fired at least one ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast, adding to a series of weapons demonstrations that have raised tensions in the region.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday did not immediately confirm how far the missile flew. It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area. Japanese broadcaster NHK said the missile likely didn’t reach the country’s exclusive economic zone.
The launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea’s military said Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the northwest.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
The weapons North Korea have tested this year include an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to target the U.S. mainland as well as cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at the Seoul capital area.
North Korea also said last month that it tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile as it tries to expand its arsenal of weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.

Korea’s Hanwha says it is a ‘credible buyer’ for shipbuilder Austal,"Street Talk has previously reported that New York’s JF Lehman & Company, which specialises in investing in complex and regulated sectors, has also been interested in Austal, as has Cerberus Capital Management, a $US60 billion ($88 billion) alternative asset investor. Former treasurer Joe Hockey’s Bondi Partners has also previously expressed interest in putting together a consortium of investors to take Austal private.
Hanwha’s bid for Austal comes as the company aggressively expands into shipbuilding, acquiring a controlling interest in Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, one of South Korea’s three major shipbuilders, last year for $US1.49 billion ($2.24 billion). Daewoo Shipbuilding subsequently changed its name to Hanwha Ocean.
In a statement, Hanwha said it had made the takeover offer for Austal because it was a “known entity” and the acquisition would “build upon the countries’ alliances and support Australia’s national security as a partner and ally”.
“Hanwha believes an Austal acquisition would benefit numerous stakeholders, including
governments, shareholders, employees, and communities and is planning to go through all the proper processes towards a successful sale,” it said.
But Austal said it rejected the bid after assessing “the potential for shareholder value creation, competition concerns and a potential purchaser’s ability to ultimately complete a transaction (which would include necessary government approvals).”
“This latter consideration is particularly relevant in relation to the proposal from Hanwha, given Austal’s position as the designer and builder of defence vessels for the Australian and US navies and ownership clauses associated with defence contracts,” it told investors on Tuesday, adding some contracts required “a commitment to ensuring continuous naval shipbuilding in Australia”.
In December, Austal won a near $1.3 billion contract to design and build three medical ships for the US Navy, taking its order book to more than $11 billion. It is also expected to benefit from a large pool of work that will be available as part of the AUKUS defence pact between Australia, the US and the United Kingdom.
Andrew and Nicola Forrest own 19.6 per cent of the stock through their private Tattarang investment vehicle and have installed former Australian rear admiral Lee Goddard, the chief executive of the Australian Missile Corporation, as their representative on the Austal board.",2024-04-01T22:58:11Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review

SEOUL – North Korea test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast Tuesday, South Korea’s military said, as it pushes to advance its weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and flew about 600 kilometers (372 miles) before landing in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the launch likely followed up on a North Korean test in March of a solid-fuel engine built for a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile it has been developing. If perfected, such weapons could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond, experts say.
Lee didn’t specify why the South Koreans were assessing the missile as an IRBM or whether it was flown at less than its capacity, but said the North Koreans were likely experimenting with new warhead technologies.
Japan’s Defense Ministry gave more details in its assessment, saying the missile flew about 650 kilometers (403 miles) while reaching a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles) before landing in waters outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone. The Japanese military didn’t immediately say whether it assessed the missile as intermediate range or something else.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile has been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security.”
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
Following the March 19 test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods of time.
Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm its adversaries’ missile defense systems. Other weapons North Korea have tested this year include cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at the Seoul capital area.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year. South Korea’s military said Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the northwest.
Kim has described satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military movements and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles. Last November, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit for the first time.

North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile,"SEOUL – North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on April 2, South Korea’s military said, in a move that sparked immediate condemnation from the Prime Minister of Japan.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the country detected the launch of what appeared to be a ballistic missile of an intermediate-range class from the area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang at 6.53am.
It flew about 600km before falling into the sea, South Korea said, while Japan’s Defence Ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650km and hit a maximum altitude of 100km.
The statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.
In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported.
Japan said the apparent missile had already fallen outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone.
Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation.
Officials in the US, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations.
South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on April 2.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea for the missile launch that affected the peace and stability of the region, he told reporters.
North Korea recently said it had no interest in a summit with Japan and would reject any talks, potentially worsening already-hostile relations between the two countries.

North Korea Fires Ballistic Missile Ahead of South’s Election,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least one suspected ballistic missile in a show of force that came just days ahead of national elections in South Korea for parliamentary seats.
North Korea launched an unidentified ballistic missile toward waters off its east coast Tuesday, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a message sent to reporters. The missile likely landed outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, Kyodo News reported citing a government official it did not name. Further details on the launch were not immediately available
This is the third test of ballistic missiles from Kim Jong Un’s regime this year. On March 18, North Korea fired at least six short-range ballistic missiles as the leader oversaw tests of multiple rocket launcher systems.

North Korea has a habit of provocations that coincide with elections in South Korea, which is set for a national vote on April 10. Kim’s regime has bristled at the government of current conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol who has taken a hard line with Pyongyang and the latest launch serves as a reminder of North Korea’s threats to security.
Kim guided military drills last month that included fire from an artillery unit capable of hitting Seoul, stepping up threats against his neighbor that coincided with it holding joint military training with the US.

Pyongyang fired 30 ballistic missiles and three space rockets in 2023. They included five intercontinental ballistic missiles that could hit the US mainland. Kim’s regime launched more than 70 ballistic missiles in 2022, a record for the state.

South Korea’s president vows not to back down in the face of doctors’ strike over medical school plan,"South Korea’s president vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts “an illegal collective action” that poses “a grave threat to our society.”
About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks, causing hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools have also submitted resignations though they haven’t stopped treating patients.
Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes.
Public surveys show that a majority of ordinary South Koreans support the government plan. But observers say many people are increasingly fed up with the protracted confrontation between the government and doctors, threatening to deal a blow to governing party candidates ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections.
In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea’s doctor-to-patient ratio – 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people – is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world.
“Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can’t further delay,” Yoon said.
Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people’s lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains their calls for a much smaller increase in the medical school enrolment quota.
“I can’t tolerate an attempt to carry through their thoughts by force without due logic and grounds,” Yoon said. “The illegal collective action by some doctors has become a grave threat to our society.”
Yoon said the recruitment plan won’t lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world.
Later Monday, the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, criticized Yoon for repeating what his government has already argued to support the recruitment plan.
“It was an address that brought us greater disappointment because we had high hopes” for some changes in the government’s position, Kim Sung-geun, a spokesperson for KMA’s emergency committee, told reporters.
Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn’t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.
Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon.
It’s unclear if the government and doctors can find a breakthrough to settle their standoff anytime soon. Last week, KMA elected Lim Hyun-taek, a hardliner who has called for a decrease in the medical school admission cap, as its new chief.
After his election Tuesday, Lim said that doctors can sit down for talks with the government if Yoon apologizes and dismisses top health officials involved in the recruitment plan. Lim also threatened to launch an all-out fight if any doctors receive punitive steps over their recent protests.
The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors in South Korea – estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors’ association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training.
Doctors say the government enrolment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-04-01T12:14:26Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail

Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people’s lives in line with the local medical law.

Yoon said the recruitment plan won’t lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world.
Later Monday, the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, criticized Yoon for repeating what his government has already argued to support the recruitment plan.
“It was an address that brought us greater disappointment because we had high hopes” for some changes in the government’s position, Kim Sung-geun, a spokesperson for KMA’s emergency committee, told reporters.
Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn’t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.
Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon.
It’s unclear if the government and doctors can find a breakthrough to settle their standoff anytime soon. Last week, KMA elected Lim Hyun-taek, a hardliner who has called for a decrease in the medical school admission cap, as its new chief.
After his election Tuesday, Lim said that doctors can sit down for talks with the government if Yoon apologizes and dismisses top health officials involved in the recruitment plan. Lim also threatened to launch an all-out fight if any doctors receive punitive steps over their recent protests.
The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors in South Korea — estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors’ association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30% to 40% of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training.
Doctors say the government enrollment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-04-01T09:49:53Z,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press
North Korea says it will launch 'several' spy satellites this year,"North Korea said Monday it planned to place ""several"" spy satellites into orbit this year, following its first successful launch in November, which leader Kim Jong Un oversaw. File Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, April 1 (UPI) -- North Korea said Monday it was on its way to becoming a ""space power"" and vowed to put several more reconnaissance satellites into orbit this year, following its first successful launch in November. ""Great progress has been made in strengthening the national defense capability with the successful launch of the reconnaissance satellite 'Malligyong-1' last year,"" Pak Kyong Su, vice director of the North's National Aerospace Technology Administration said, according to state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""Several reconnaissance satellites are expected to be launched this year as well."" Advertisement
Pak made the comments on the anniversary of the founding of the North's space development agency on April 1.
North Korea has also been working on satellite projects for sectors including agriculture, weather observation, communications, land management and disaster prevention, Pak added.
""The development of the space industry is a key factor in opening up a shortcut to securing the status of a world-class economic, scientific and technological power,"" he said. ""We will surely build a space power by continuing to spur independent space development.""
North Korea successfully placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit last November after a pair of failed attempts earlier in the year.

That launch drew scrutiny amid Pyongyang's growing military ties with Moscow following a September visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Russia. The trip included a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a space launch facility.
Seoul and Washington say that Pyongyang has been shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
South Korea's Unification Ministry, which manages inter-Korean affairs, said Monday that Seoul is monitoring launch sites and key facilities in close coordination with the United States.
""We will not make any predictions about the possibility of launching a military satellite in the future, but will prepare for all possibilities through close cooperation with relevant organizations,"" ministry spokesperson Koo Byung-sam said at a press briefing.
""Regardless of the purpose of the satellites that North Korea claims, any North Korean satellite using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" he added.
South Korea's military said Monday that it detected no signs of preparations for an impending launch.
""Currently, there are no imminent signs of a reconnaissance satellite launch from the Tongchang-ri launch site,"" Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Col. Lee Sung-joon said at a press briefing. ""South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities have been closely coordinating to monitor and track North Korea's military activities.""",2024-04-01T09:38:09Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
South Korea's Yoon vows not to back down in the face of doctors' strike over medical school plan,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s president vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts “an illegal collective action” that poses ""a grave threat to our society.”

About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks, causing hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools have also submitted resignations though they haven’t stopped treating patients.

Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes.

Public surveys show that a majority of ordinary South Koreans support the government plan. But observers say many people are increasingly fed up with the protracted confrontation between the government and doctors, threatening to deal a blow to governing party candidates ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections.

In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea's doctor-to-patient ratio — 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people — is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world.
“Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can't further delay,” Yoon said.

Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people's lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains their calls for a much smaller increase in the medical school enrollment quota.

"South Korea’s Export Growth Continues, Supporting Economy","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s exports continued to grow last month, supporting confidence among policymakers that the economy will see a solid first quarter on the back of rising global demand for semiconductors and technology devices.
Average daily shipments increased 9.9% from a year earlier, according to data released Monday by the trade ministry. Without adjustment for the number of working days, headline exports rose 3.1% while overall imports decreased by 12.3%. The trade surplus came to $4.3 billion.
South Korea is among the world’s largest exporters of goods and serves as a bellwether for global commerce. Its dominance in memory chips and smarthphones also makes the nation a barometer for tech demand. The latest figures point to continued recovery in global demand especially in the chip sector.
South Korean exports of chips increased 35.7% from a year earlier in March to $11.7 billion, the largest monthly sales total since March 2022, the ministry said. Display exports rose 16.2% and computer sales increased 24.5%, too, underscoring the momentum that stems from technology demand.
Semiconductor sales have been brisk in recent months, allowing overall exports to rebound. The growth momentum in exports that has carried into this year is one reason authorities expect the South Korean economy to expand faster in 2024 than last year.
Still, the chip recovery will need to be accompanied by a stronger pickup in exports of other products such as automobiles, steel and oil chemicals for authorities to be more certain that the economy will grow more than 2% as they estimate.
Shipments of automobiles fell 5% and those of machinery decreased 10% from a year earlier in March, according to the ministry. Oil products rose 3.1%.
The Goods Trade Barometer managed by the World Trade Organization reached 100.6 last month, slightly above the trend baseline, indicating weak upward momentum in global trade.
“Merchandise trade should continue to recover gradually in the early months of 2024, but any gains could be easily derailed by regional conflicts and geopolitical tensions,"" the global organization said last month.
As a nation that has China as its biggest trading partner and the US as its top security ally, South Korea is among the nations most vulnerable to geopolitical clashes that can weigh on international trade momentum. While US consumer sentiment and spending have remained strong, demand from China has been underwhelming as the world’s second-largest economy struggles to emerge from its property slump.
Adding to risks this year is a series of elections scheduled across a wide swathe of the world that could result in protectionist policies that damage trade-reliant economies like South Korea’s.
The country itself will hold parliamentary elections later this month, in a vote that could influence the degree to which it re-calibrates its relationship with China in the long run.

"India, Korea and Japan to Stay Busy With IPOs While China Stalls","(Bloomberg) -- After the worst quarter in five years for Asia Pacific initial public offerings, a pick up activity is expected from South Korea, India and Japan while Chinese deals are likely to remain sparse.
New share sales across the region fell to $11 billion between January and March, the lowest tally for a quarter since early 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The amount represents a 46% drop from the same period last year.
While IPOs returned to major venues in Europe and the US, the slowdown in Asia was mostly due to Beijing’s decision to ramp up scrutiny of domestic new share sales as it tries to boost confidence in its equities market. Large deals in Hong Kong also vanished amid concerns about to China’s economy. The city hasn’t hosted an offering larger than $1 billion since Oct. 2022.
Syngenta Group withdrew its long-delayed application for a $9 billion initial public offering in Shanghai last week, another blow to China’s equity markets after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. scrapped the listing of its logistics arm.
Elsewhere in the region, new share sales set to raise several hundred million dollars are surfacing. In South Korea, marine services company HD Hyundai Marine Solution Co. and one shareholder are seeking as much as 742 billion won ($551 million) this month. Even priced at the bottom of range, it would the largest IPO in Seoul since early 2022.
India has hosted a flurry of tiny deals since the start of January, drawing scrutiny from regulators during the past month. With demand for equities in the country remaining high, offerings bigger than $100 million are expected to be taken to the market.
A shareholder of telecom service provider Bharti Hexacom Ltd. is this week set to start selling shares in the company that may raise as much as 42.8 billion rupees ($513 million). The pipeline of expected large deals in Mumbai also includes a potential $1 billion offering by Bajaj Housing Finance Ltd.
In Japan, a 70% surge in shares of discount-store chain operator Trial Holdings Inc. since its listing on March 21 could boost sentiment for other newcomers as improving shareholder returns and corporate profits revive optimism in the local market. It’s ¥38.85 billion ($257 million) IPO was the largest in Tokyo since October.
In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the drought in what’s traditionally been one fo the world’s busiest listing venues will probably continue as Chinese firms stay on the sidelines following the scrapping of Syngenta’s and Alibaba’s proposed deals.

Jesse Lingard's manager at FC Seoul has slammed the former Manchester United star's effort since his move to South Korea last month.
Lingard moved to the K League in February after leaving Nottingham Forest at the end of the 2022/23 season. The 31-year-old featured 20 times for Forest last term, helping them avoid relegation from the Premier League.
After no move materialised last summer, Lingard opted to leave Europe to join Seoul ahead of the start of the 2024 season. He has started just once of their opening four games, coming off the bench in the 2-0 win over Jeju United.

And manager Kim Gi-dong has declared he hasn't been pleased with Lingard's work rate since his move to the Seoul World Cup Stadium. ""I've been thinking a lot about removing Jesse,"" he said.
""I don't think a player who doesn't run for a few minutes is a football player.
""If he doesn't fight, and doesn't run better than the player who runs for 90 minutes? If you're going to play soccer in the name, you shouldn't just take the retired players?""
It isn't the first time that Gi-dong has criticised Lingard. After his side picked up their first three points of the season two weeks ago, the Seoul boss was frustrated with Lingard's appearance off the bench.
""Even though he came on as a substitute, he didn't work hard and avoided tussle,"" he said. ""The name value has no meaning on the pitch. I will tell him this exactly.""
Lingard is currently out injured with a reported meniscus issue.",2024-03-31T17:00:00Z,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk,Manchester Evening News

‘Luxury’ skiing in North Korea: the Russians allowed behind the border,"Gliding down pristine, untouched mountain runs, Olga Shpalok said she was “getting 100% satisfaction”.
After a full day of skiing, the Russian designer from Vladivostok wound down with a visit to her hotel’s well-equipped spa and sauna.
“They said it was very hard to get into the country. But fate smiled upon us,” she said.
Shpalok was part of the first group of foreign tourists to visit North Korea since it shut down its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020.
In early February, she travelled to the country with 100 other Russian tourists on a four-day skiing trip summed up by the Russian embassy as “Pyongyang opens its doors”.
More than 200 Russian tourists have visited North Korea so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Their interviews and accounts give a rare insight into life in Kim Jong-un’s regime.
Closely watched by government “minders”, who restricted what they could see and where they could go, the Russian tourists described spending time in otherwise empty luxurious ski resorts. Some said they felt deep unease over the poverty and total control they witnessed.
Russia’s access to the pariah state is no coincidence. It comes at a time when the two countries have been moving closer at an unprecedented pace, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
North Korea has emerged as Russia’s largest supplier of weapons, shipping artillery shells, missiles and other equipment for Moscow’s continuing war. In exchange, Russia appears to be sending North Korea food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, bypassing international sanctions imposed on the country.
The Russian tourist groups visiting North Korea illustrate another way Moscow can help Pyongyang. Before the pandemic, an estimated 5,000 westerners visited North Korea every year as part of pricey tours but since Covid-19 the borders have been sealed.
Faced with increasingly tightening international sanctions and a reported food crisis triggered by the pandemic isolation, any hard currency is a welcome addition to Pyongyang’s cash-strapped coffers.
“It’s a telling reflection of the regime’s priorities that North Korea has opted to allow Russian tourists access, yet continues to rebuff appeals from humanitarian organisations pleading for entry,” said Hanna Song, of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights in Seoul.
The group tours, first announced in January by several Russian tourist agencies, cost $750 (£600). This includes the round-trip air fare to Pyongyang, North Korea’s sole international airport in the capital. Also covered were the domestic flight to the ski resort on North Korea’s eastern coast, the hotel stay, and meals.
The $40 daily ski pass, souvenirs and other expenses, including alcohol and cigarettes, were paid out of pocket in cash.
The tours begin with a two-hour flight from the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok to Pyongyang, operated by the North Korean state-owned Air Koryo airlines. It is made up of an ageing fleet of mostly Russian-made Tu-154 aircraft.
“When I boarded the plane, I wondered if we were going to make it at all,” recalled Alexandra Daniyelko, a PR manager from Moscow who joined one of the tours.
On arrival at Pyongyang, the Russian tourists visited central Kim Il-sung Square, bowed to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il on Mansu Hill and attended a youth musical performance at the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where members of communist youth groups put on patriotic music and dance performance.

These carefully staged shows are traditionally steeped in government propaganda aimed at instilling North Koreans with national pride and loyalty to Kim’s family, which has ruled ruthlessly since it came to power in 1948.
“I cried at the purity, kindness and talent of these kids,” said Daniyelko, describing the performance.
Another Russian tourist described the children as “perfectly disciplined and obedient”, adding that the local minders confiscated the chocolates that some Russian tourists brought for the children.
But for many on the trip, the holiday truly kicked off on the second day, when the tourists boarded an internal flight to the coastal town of Wonsan near the Masikryong ski resort.
The resort is one of the large-scale construction projects built at the behest of Kim in recent years, thought to have cost £24m. Guests are ferried to the slopes on old Austrian-made gondolas imported from China.
Ahead of the resort’s opening in 2014, a ski-less Kim was photographed in a lift chair smoking a cigarette.
The Russian tourists were told they would be staying at a “five-star Swiss Alps-style resort” which was built on the orders of Kim, himself educated in Switzerland.
Images published on Instagram showed polished hotel rooms, a modern swimming pool, a sauna, a massage area and a hair salon.
“There weren’t any people on the main slopes, which was just perfect,” said Yekaterina Kolomeetsa, a travel blogger from Vladivostok.
Empty ski pistes are hardly surprising considering that there are reportedly just 5,500 skiers among a population of 24 million.
Despite North Korea’s best efforts to present a highly curated image of their country, some Russian tourists said they left disturbed.
“You could sense hopelessness and constant control in the country during the entire trip,” said Shpalok. In Pyongyang, as she rode on a bus with other tourists, she said she rarely saw any cars or people on the roads. “We asked our guides where everyone was. They told us people were happily at work.”
The tourists were strictly forbidden from filming ordinary houses or people and couldn’t venture on walks alone. The few people Shpalok did see looked “short and hungry”, while some children were “barely dressed” despite the cold.
Yulia Mishkova, another Russian tourist, said the trip was worth it for those “looking for a dose of absurdity”.
“I just felt sorry for the frightened North Koreans,” Mishkova said, adding that it was hard to ignore the fact that her daily ski pass cost more than the average monthly salary. “I will not go again for moral and ethical reasons.”
Still, both countries appear to have big plans for the future. According to a report by the government of Primorsky Krai, a region in Russia’s far east on the border of the two countries, North Korea is also building another mass ski resort for Russian tourists that will include 17 hotels, 37 guesthouses and 29 shops.
Tatyana Markova, a representative of the Vostok Intur travel agency, said two hiking trips to North Korea have already been planned for the Russian holidays in May.
“This is just the start,” said a recent advertisement promoting the May tours to North Korea. “Make sure you book your spot fast!”",2024-03-31T12:02:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"Nearly 30% of South Korean students overweight, with more binge drinking than before","SEOUL - The percentage of South Korean students who are overweight or obese inched down in 2023 compared with the year before, but a growing percentage of students were categorised as heavy drinkers, a government report showed on March 28.
Some 29.6 per cent of elementary, middle and high school students across the country fell into the overweight or obese categories, according to the joint report by the Ministry of Education and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.
This figure marked a slight decrease of 0.9 percentage points from the year before, and a drop of 1.2 percentage points compared with in 2021.
South Korea defines those with a body-mass index (BMI) of between 23 and 24.9 as overweight, and 25 or above as obese.
These definitions are different from the World Health Organisation’s standard, in which a BMI of between 25 and 29.9 is defined as overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is defined as obese.
Officials conducted the study based on a survey of 87,182 students at 1,009 schools across South Korea.
The survey showed that students living in rural areas – administrative areas categorised as “eup” or “myeon” – had a higher rate of being overweight or obese at 34.4 per cent, compared with 28.7 per cent for those living in urban areas.
The report showed that the average weight of students in their final year of high school has inched up – the weight of boys went up 0.9kg to 72.7kg, while that of girls increased 0.7kg to 58.2kg.
Male students in the final year of middle school weighed more than in the prior year, but girls weighed less, with boys hitting 64.6kg and girls 55.1kg.
However, the weights of both sixth grade boys and girls decreased, with that of boys falling by 1kg to 50.6kg, and that of girls by 0.2kg to 47kg.
The government also surveyed the smoking and drinking rates of students in middle and high schools; the smoking rate refers to the percentage of those who had smoked at least once in the past 30 days, and the drinking rate refers to students who had at least one drink in the same period. The combined smoking rate was 4.2 per cent, down 0.3 per cent from the year before.
By gender, it was 5.6 per cent for males, down 0.6 percentage points compared with in 2022, and 2.7 per cent for females, the same as in 2022.
The drinking rate for both boys and girls dropped from the year before, from 15 per cent to 13 per cent for boys, and from 10.9 per cent to 9 per cent for girls.
But while the report showed that fewer students overall are drinking alcohol, those who do are drinking a lot.
Of those categorised as drinkers, the percentage of those who did “dangerous drinking” – which the study defines as boys having five shots or more of soju and girls having three shots or more of soju at least once in the past 30 days – was 41.3 per cent for boys and 50.1 per cent for girls.

Alan Titchmarsh’s gardening trousers’ totally justified brush with North Korean censors,"Oh, Lord. Western popular culture has sent the North Korean commissars into a frenzy of censorship. Have they turned against the lubricious stylings of Megan Thee Stallion? Has Emma Stone’s “furious jumping” in Poor Things finally landed in Pyongyang? No, this is all to do with Alan Titchmarsh’s trousers (now there’s a name for a band).
One could hardly imagine a less threatening figure than that Yorkshire-born shrub wrangler. True, around the millennial years, he accrued a reputation for including “sexy” scenes in his popular novels, but nobody seriously suggested he was any latter-day Marquis de Sade. With his sensible jumpers and unthreatening gilets, Titchmarsh remains the personification of television’s midafternoon cosy tendency. Many biographers of Alan Partridge see him as a key inspiration for that fictional chatmeister (though Patrick Marber, who created Alan with Steve Coogan, told me sports reporter Elton Welsby was the key progenitor). How unlikely to find him at the centre of an international incident.
[ Patrick Marber: ‘I’ve never had a good idea I didn’t immediately regret’ ]
Loosen your cardigan. Fan your armpits with this dwarf gardenia. Nothing has burst loose from the Titchmarsh gusset. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is reigniting a fashion war that the rest of the world settled 40 or 50 years ago. It seems that a showing of Alan Titchmarsh’s Garden Secrets on Korean television blurred out the presenter’s jeans. Those garments are, the BBC website tells us, seen as “a symbol of western imperialism”. Stills do not suggest anything bulb-clutchingly tight. Titchmarsh appears to have gone for the looser Clarkson-style jean cut.
“It’s taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart,” he commented. “I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist – I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it’s given me a bit of street cred.”

Were we 107 we might suggest last week’s news confirms the completion of a cycle for the blue jean. Once a symbol of rebellion, the garments have gone beyond general acceptability to become a uniform of capitalist conformity. Oh what an irony. Blah, blah, blah.
Alan Titchmarsh on North Korean television, with censored trousers
When did that happen? Well, a long, long time ago. It is nearly 50 years since Gloria Vanderbilt launched her highly priced brand of designer jeans. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan wore them when in office, but only when riding horses under big western skies (Ron) or when folksily chopping logs with the Allman Brothers Band (Jim). By the 1990s, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were actually wearing them indoors. There are still golf clubs and workplaces where jeans are prohibited, but the notion those garments convey anti-establishment leanings went out with the eight-track cartridge and the closed shop.
And yet. It is not insane to detect an irony in this arc. For decades denim jeans were workwear for manual employees. The prehistory goes back to Italy and India (it makes sense that the word “dungaree” derives from that country), but the current ubiquitous trouser emerged in close to its present form as a favourite of miners, farmers and cowboys in the United States during the 19th century. Levi Strauss & Co produced the first version of their own famous jeans in 1873.
It took a long time for them to emerge from the workplace and on to the legs of movie stars. By the early 1940s, something called “western chic” was beginning to attract those celebrities, but you wouldn’t catch Joan Crawford wearing jeans anywhere other than on a ranch (or in Johnny Guitar). It was the generation of Marlon Brando and James Dean that really launched the garment as a youth cult. In Rebel Without a Cause, Dean is distinguished from the older generation by both his surly attitude and his taste for red windbreakers and blue jeans. This was an era when a fellow was expected to cast off such garb when adulthood loomed.
[ Forever in blue jeans - ups and downs of a pair of denims ]
The notion of jeans as a cultural indicator – the preserve of anti-war protesters and sociology lecturers – continued throughout the 1960s, but, a decade or so later, semioticians would struggle to find any meaning in their appearance. By the 1980s, they had become so unremarkable that, in a move of Machiavellian brilliance, Levi had to reinvent the “501″ (something nobody outside the business had then heard of) as a much-beloved classic that, flogged in gorgeous retro ads to the accompaniment of Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye, cost as much as a pair of fine gaberdine slacks. The jeans worn by miners. The jeans worn by biker gangs. The jeans worn by the Trotskyists handing out leaflets at railway stations. Those jeans had been remodelled as luxury items.
On reflection, perhaps the North Koreans are on to something. Titchmarsh and his trousers really are embodiments of imperial decadence. Pixelate away.",2024-03-31T04:00:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times
"Samsung archrival plans construction of world's largest chip factory — at more than $90 billion, it will take more than 20 years to finish, so one wonders what other exciting tech will it produce","SK Hynix, Samsung's chief competitor and the world's number two memory maker, has begun its audacious plan to build the largest chip production facility on the planet.
The construction at SK Hynix's giant Yongin Semiconductor Cluster in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, will comprise four units. Work on the first unit, which is intended to be the world’s biggest three-story fabrication plant, is anticipated to commence in March 2025.
The Korea Economic Daily reports that the project is estimated to cost over 120 trillion won ($90.7 billion) and will span over two decades, with completion expected by 2046.
Government backing
The plan was first announced in 2019 but ran into delays due to Covid and licensing procedures. It received a boost in 2022 following an agreement between the government, municipalities, and companies, according to SK Hynix. The site of the first unit is now 35% prepared.
Trade Minister Ahn Deokgeun visited the site recently, promising government support for Korea's chip industry. “All ministries will work together to ensure that Korean companies won’t lag behind global players in semiconductor manufacturing speed. We will actively support high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to achieve more than $120 billion in semiconductor exports this year,” he said.
The Korea Economic Daily says the government will unveil strategies to accelerate artificial intelligence chip exports and bolster semiconductor equipment by the end of June.
Creating the world’s largest chip factory is just part of SK Hynix’s future plans. The manufacturing giant is also intending to invest $4 billion to build an advanced chip packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana.

World Cup 2026 qualifying: Japan awarded forfeit 3-0 win against North Korea by Fifa,"Last updated on .From the section Football
Japan beat North Korea 1-0 in Tokyo earlier in March
Japan have been awarded a 3-0 forfeit win after North Korea called off a 2026 World Cup qualifier due to be held in Pyongyang earlier in March, says Japan's Football Association.
North Korea requested the match to be held at a neutral venue due to worries over infectious diseases in Japan.
The JFA said it has been informed by Fifa's disciplinary committee that the match has been forfeited.
The win means Japan go through to the third round of World Cup qualifiers.
""Although the players lost an important opportunity to play, I see this as a positive step forward,"" Japan manager Hajime Moriyasu said.
""Naturally, we will not be satisfied with this result, but will continue to build up our strength for the national team activities in June, the final qualifying round, and the World Cup.""
Fifa previously said the match - which should have taken place on Tuesday, 26 March - could not be rescheduled.

Russia's veto on UN monitoring of North Korea sanctions sparks international backlash,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that Moscow’s stance aligns with its interests, while the European Union labeled Russia’s veto as an attempt to conceal unlawful arms transfers between North Korea and Russia
Russia faced widespread criticism on Friday following its use of veto power to effectively terminate official United Nations monitoring of sanctions on North Korea amid investigations into alleged arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.
The Russian veto at the UN Security Council on Thursday prevented the renewal of the panel of experts tasked with probing violations of sanctions related to North Korea’s prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

South Korea’s foreign ministry condemned the move as “irresponsible,” with Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea’s UN ambassador, likening it to destroying surveillance cameras to evade detection while committing a crime. Seoul has accused Pyongyang of shipping thousands of weapon containers to Moscow for deployment in Ukraine.
The Kremlin defended its veto, arguing that UN sanctions on North Korea have impeded dialogue and peace efforts on the Korean peninsula and have not contributed to regional security. Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, emphasised that international restrictive measures over the years have failed to improve the security situation in the region.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that Moscow’s stance aligns with its interests, while the European Union labeled Russia’s veto as an attempt to conceal unlawful arms transfers between North Korea and Russia, particularly in the context of Russia’s alleged illegal war in Ukraine.
The United States, meanwhile, said the vote was a “self-interested effort to bury the panel’s reporting on its own collusion” with North Korea.

“Russia’s actions today have cynically undermined international peace and security, all to advance the corrupt bargain that Moscow has struck with the DPRK,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said after the Thursday vote.
The panel’s mandate expires at the end of April.
North Korea has been under mounting sanctions since 2006, put in place by the UN Security Council in response to its nuclear program.

Since 2019, Russia and China have tried to persuade the Security Council to ease the sanctions, which have no expiration date.
The council has long been divided on the issue.
- ‘Political solution’ -
China abstained rather than joining Russia in the veto. All other members had voted in favor of renewing the expert panel.

Beijing said Friday it opposed “blindly supporting sanctions” on North Korea.
“The current situation in the (Korean) Peninsula remains tense, and blindly imposing sanctions cannot solve the issue,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said.
“A political solution is the only way,” he said when asked why Beijing abstained during the vote, adding that a “showdown at the UN Security Council is not conducive to its authority.”

China and Russia have in recent years ramped up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts, and their strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzia had earlier said that without an annual review to assess and potentially modify the sanctions, the panel was unjustified.
“The panel has continued to focus on trivial matters that are not commensurate with the problems facing the peninsula,” Nebenzia said.
- Continued tests -
Additional Security Council sanctions were levelled on Pyongyang in 2016 and 2017, but the North’s development of its nuclear and weapons programmes has continued unabated.
Last week, Pyongyang tested a solid-fuel engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” state media reported.
Recent cruise missile launches have prompted speculation that North Korea is testing those weapons before shipping them to Moscow for use in Ukraine.
In its latest report, issued at the beginning of March, the sanctions panel reported that North Korea “continued to flout” sanctions, including by launching ballistic missiles and breaching oil import limits.
It added that it is investigating reports of arms shipments from Pyongyang to Russia for use in Ukraine.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to social media Thursday to call the veto “a guilty plea”.

Why Russia Is Protecting North Korea From Nuclear Monitors,"Through the most tense encounters with President Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia over the past decade, there has been one project in which Washington and Moscow have claimed common cause: keeping North Korea from expanding its arsenal of nuclear weapons.
Now, even that has fallen apart.
On Thursday, Russia used its veto power in the United Nations Security Council to kill off a U.N. panel of experts that has been monitoring North Korea’s efforts to evade sanctions over its nuclear program for the past 15 years.
Russia’s discomfort with the group is a new development. Moscow once welcomed the panel’s detailed reports about sanctions violations and considered Pyongyang’s nuclear program to be a threat to global security.
But more recently, the panel has provided vivid evidence of how Russia is keeping the North brimming with fuel and other goods, presumably in return for the artillery shells and missiles that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is shipping to Russia for use against Ukraine. The group has produced satellite images of ship-to-ship transfers of oil, showing how the war in Ukraine has proved to be a bonanza for the North.",2024-03-29T21:18:14Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
Un soare de 7 ori mai cald în Korea. Cum au reușit cercetătorii să creeze un soare artificial timp de 48 de secunde,"Pentru prima dată, reactorul de fuziune KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research) al Institutului Coreean de Energie de Fuziune (KFE) a atins temperaturi de șapte ori mai mari decât nucleul Soarelui.
Realizat în timpul testelor între decembrie 2023 și februarie 2024, acest lucru stabilește un nou record pentru proiectul reactorului de fuziune, relatează Intresting Engineering.
Echipa de cercetare din spatele reactorului KSTAR a reușit să mențină temperaturi de 100 de milioane de grade Celsius timp de 48 de secunde. Pentru comparație, temperatura nucleului Soarelui nostru este de 15 milioane de grade Celsius. Mai mult, reactorul a menținut modul de confinare înaltă (H-mode) timp de peste 100 de secunde. Modul H este o stare stabilă a plasmei care este mai bine confinată decât modul de confinare scăzută.
Acesta este cel mai recent succes din multe pentru KSTAR. De exemplu, în 2021, KSTAR a stabilit un nou record prin funcționarea la un milion de grade și menținerea plasmei super fierbinți timp de 30 de secunde.

Fuziunea: de 7 ori mai fierbinte decât Soarele
Fuziunea este un proces care imită același proces care generează lumină și căldură din stele. Implică fuzionarea hidrogenului și altor elemente ușoare pentru a elibera o putere uriașă pe care experții din domeniu speră să o valorifice pentru electricitate nelimitată, fără carbon. Acest lucru este adesea numit „Sfântul Graal” al tranziției energetice.
Potrivit Consiliului Național de Cercetare Științifică și Tehnologică al Coreei (NST), crearea unei tehnologii care poate menține plasme cu temperaturi ridicate și densități ridicate, unde reacțiile de fuziune au loc cel mai eficient, pentru perioade prelungite, este crucială. Potrivit NST, secretul din spatele acestor realizări majore este constituit de divertoarele de tungsten. Acestea sunt componente vitale situate la baza vasului de vid într-un dispozitiv de fuziune magnetică. Acestea joacă un rol crucial în expulzarea gazelor deșeuri și impurităților din reactor, rezistând în același timp unor încărcături termice de suprafață substanțiale. Echipa KSTAR a trecut recent la utilizarea tungstenului în divertoarele sale.
Tungstenul are punctul de topire cel mai ridicat dintre toate metalele, iar succesul echipei în menținerea modului H pentru perioade mai lungi de timp se atribuie în mare parte acestei îmbunătățiri reușite. NST raportează că această schimbare a reprezentat o îmbunătățire semnificativă.
""Tungstenul oferă avantaje semnificative pentru operațiile de încălzire puternică de lungă durată,"" a explicat NST. Succesul divertoarelor de tungsten poate oferi date inestimabile pentru proiectul International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). ITER este un megaproiect de fuziune internațional de 21,5 miliarde de dolari, dezvoltat în Franța de zeci de țări, inclusiv Coreea, China, SUA, UE și Rusia.

Recharge News raportează că se așteaptă ca ITER să atingă primul său plasma în 2025 și să fie complet funcțional până în 2035. Tungstenul va fi folosit în propriile sale divertoare.
Suk Jae Yoo, președintele Institutului Coreean de Energie de Fuziune, a anunțat că cercetarea reprezintă un ""semnal verde"" pentru obținerea tehnologiilor de bază necesare pentru reactoarele ""DEMO"", care sunt centrale electrice demonstrative în viitor.

Trump states that Kim offered to take some steps toward dismantling his nuclear arsenal, but not enough to warrant ending sanctions imposed on the country.
March 8 – Analysts say that satellite images indicate possible activity at a launch facility, suggesting that the country may be preparing to shoot a missile or a rocket.
March 15 – North Korea’s foreign minister tells reporters that the country has no intention to “yield to the US demands.” In the wake of the comment, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insists that negotiations will continue.
May 4 – South Korea’s Defense Ministry states that North Korea test-fired 240 mm and 300 mm multiple rocket launchers, including a new model of a tactical guide weapon on May 3. According to the defense ministry’s assessment, the launchers’ range is about 70 to 240 kilometers (43 to 149 miles). The test is understood to be the first missile launch from North Korea since late 2017 – and the first since Trump began meeting with Kim.
October 2 – North Korea says it test fired a new type of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), a day after Pyongyang and Washington agreed to resume nuclear talks. The launch marks a departure from the tests of shorter range missiles North Korea has carried out in recent months.
December 3 – In a statement, Ri Thae Song, a first vice minister at the North Korean Foreign Ministry working on US affairs, warns the United States to prepare for a “Christmas gift,” which some interpret as the resumption of long-distance missile testing. December 25 passes without a “gift” from the North Korean regime, but US officials remain watchful.
2020
October 10 – North Korea unveils what analysts believe to be one of the world’s largest ballistic missiles at a military parade celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Workers’ Party broadcast on state-run television.
2021
August 27 – In an annual report on Pyongyang’s nuclear program, the IAEA says North Korea appears to have restarted operations at a power plant capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The IAEA says that clues, such as the discharge of cooling water, observed in early July, indicated the plant is active. No such evidence had been observed since December 2018.
September 13 – North Korea claims it successfully test-fired new long-range cruise missiles on September 11 and 12, according to the country’s state-run KCNA. According to KCNA, the missiles traveled for 7,580 seconds along oval and figure-eight flight orbits in the air above the territorial land and waters of North Korea and hit targets 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away. The US and neighboring South Korea are looking into the launch claims, officials in both countries tell CNN.
October 14 – An academic study finds that North Korea can get all the uranium it needs for nuclear weapons through its existing Pyongsan mill, and, based on satellite imagery, may be able to increase production above its current rate.
2022
January 12 – The United States announces sanctions on eight North Korean and Russian individuals and entities for supporting North Korea’s ballistic missile programs.
January 20 – North Korea says it will reconsider its moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, according to state media.
March 24 – North Korea fires what is believed to be its first intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017. Analysts say the test could be the longest-range missile yet fired by North Korea, possibly representing a new type of ICBM.
September 9 – North Korean state media reports that North Korea has passed a new law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state. Leader Kim Jong Un vows the country will “never give up” its nuclear weapons and says there will be no negotiations on denuclearization.
October 4 – North Korea fires a ballistic missile without warning over Japan for the first time in five years, a highly provocative and reckless act that marks a significant escalation in its weapons testing program.
October 10 – North Korea performs a series of seven practice drills, intended to demonstrate its readiness to fire tactical nuclear warheads at potential targets in South Korea. Quoting leader Kim Jong Un, who oversaw the drills, KCNA says the tests, which coincided with nearby military drills between the United States, South Korea and Japan, showed Pyongyang was ready to respond to regional tensions by involving its “huge armed forces.”
2023
January 1 – Pyongyang’s state media reports that Kim Jong Un is calling for an “exponential increase” in his country’s nuclear weapons arsenal in response to what he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States.
July 18 – South Korea’s Defense Ministry announces the presence of a nuclear capable US Navy ballistic missile submarine in the South Korean port city of Busan. The arrival of the submarine follows a period of heightened tensions on the peninsula, during which North Korea has both tested what it said was an advanced long range missile and threatened to shoot down US military reconnaissance aircraft.
September 28 – The state-run Korean Central News Agency reports North Korea has amended its constitution to bolster and expand its nuclear force, with leader Kim Jong Un pointing to the growing cooperation between the United States, South Korea and Japan. The law added into North Korea’s constitution reinforces North Korea’s view that it is a forever nuclear power and that the idea of denuclearizing or giving up its weapons is not up for discussion.

"North Korea Preparing Spy Satellite Launch, South Says","South Korea has warned that North Korea is preparing to launch a new satellite as the race to deploy reconnaissance satellites between the two Koreas heats up.
""While there are activities preparing for an additional military satellite launch by North Korea, there are no signs as of now of an imminent [launch],"" South Korean Colonel Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in a briefing, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap News on Thursday.
Lee further mentioned that South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies are closely monitoring North Korea's military movements without sharing specifics.
The focus on North Korea's potential launch comes as new activity showing preparations at Sohae Satellite Launching Station was captured on satellite imagery. Tensions have escalated on the Korean Peninsula as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has moved away from the previous consensus to seek reconciliation with the southern neighbor.
North Korea's Unha-3 rocket is being prepared for takeoff at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station northwest of Pyongyang on April 8, 2012, in Cholsan County, North Phyongan Province, North Korea.

This renewed focus comes after Pyongyang's deployment of its first military reconnaissance satellite in orbit last November following two unsuccessful attempts earlier in the year.
The launch, which was part of North Korea's plan to deploy three additional spy satellites within the year, has drawn criticism from Washington and Seoul.
The United States and South Korea have denounced the action as a breach of the United Nations Security Council resolutions aimed at limiting North Korea's ballistic missile endeavors.
""Commercial satellite imagery shows an expanse of blue material on North Korea's coastal launch pad at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, the site used to conduct the last three satellite launch attempts,"" 38North, a publication specializing in North Korean affairs, reported Monday.
The 38North report mentioned the sighting of extensive blue material, possibly tarpaulin, arranged in a ""Y"" shape across a 125-meter stretch of tarmac. The setup suggests preparations for launch, mirroring the arrangements observed during previous launch attempts.
Last December, South Korea launched its first spy satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The new satellite successfully transmitted images of central Pyongyang earlier this month.
Meanwhile, experts have confirmed that North Korea's first satellite is operational.
Space analysts have recently observed orbital adjustments to the North's first spy satellite, Malligyong-1, indicating effective control, though the satellite's operational capabilities remain undisclosed. North Korea's state media boasted that the satellite had captured images of strategic military and political locations in the South Korea, the U.S., and beyond, although the claims remain unverified by independent sources, Reuters reported in February.
""But now we can definitely say the satellite is alive,"" Marco Langbroek, a satellite expert at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, wrote in a blog post, Reuters reported.",2024-03-29T14:05:01Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
‘Nothing To Talk About’: North Korea Dismisses Possibility Of Summit With Japan,"Pyongyang said on Friday it had “nothing to talk” about with Japan after claiming that a Japanese diplomat in China had made contact with a North Korean counterpart.
Relations between the two East Asian neighbours have long been strained over the kidnapping of Japanese people in the 1970s and 1980s and North Korea’s banned weapons programmes, although there had been tentative recent signs of a thaw.
A North Korean diplomat in China said on Friday an official from the Japanese embassy in Beijing had proposed “contact through an e-mail” to a councillor at its embassy in the Chinese capital but the proposal was rejected by foreign minister Choe Son Hui.
“… the DPRK will not allow any attempt of Japan to contact the former,” Choe said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name.
“The DPRK-Japan dialogue is not a matter of concern to the DPRK.”
Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, had said on Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had requested a summit with her brother, although a meeting was unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo.
But the next day she said Pyongyang would reject any such contact, citing Japan’s lack of “courage” to rebuild North Korea-Japan relations.
In a separate statement on Friday, North Korea’s ambassador to China Ri Ryong Nam said: “We have nothing to talk about with the Japanese side.”
“I make it clear once again that the DPRK has no reason to meet with the Japanese side at any level,” Ri said.
Kishida said last year he was willing to meet Kim Jong Un “without any conditions” and address all matters, including the abduction of a dozen Japanese citizens by North Korean agents.
Despite Kim Yo Jong’s earlier comments, Kishida said on Thursday he was still willing to work towards a summit to secure the return of the abducted Japanese and address other subjects.
“I’d like to continue to hold high-level dialogues (with North Korea) under my direct supervision,” he told reporters.
However, Choe criticised Kishida on Friday for referring to the abductions, saying she “cannot understand why he persistently adheres to the issue”.",2024-03-29T14:00:57Z,https://www.news18.com,News18
Russland nedlegger veto og blokkerer fornyelsen av mandatet til et panel av FN-eksperter som overvåker internasjonale sanksjoner mot Nord-Korea.,"Russland har trolig satt en stopper for kontrollen av FN-sanksjonene mot Nord-Korea.
– Det er i vår interesse, sier Vladimir Putins talsmann Dmitrij Peskov ifølge RIA etter at Russland torsdag blokkerte fornyelsen av mandatet til et panel av FN-eksperter som overvåker sanksjonene mot Kim Jong-uns Nord-Korea.
– USA kan ikke bruke gamledagse metoder lenger, sier russisk UDs talskvinne Maria Zakharova ifølge RIA.
Russlands veto i FNs sikkerhetsråd betyr ikke at sanksjonene fjernes, men kontrollen av dem blir borte – og sanksjonene derfor lettere kan omgås.
– Ansvaret for det ligger hos Vesten. USA og deres allierte vil bare kvele Nord-Korea, sier Zakharova.
USA og andre land har beskyldt Nord-Korea for å levere Russland ammunisjon og våpen til bruk i Ukraina-krigen. Hverken Russland eller Nord-Korea har bekreftet dette.
Etter avstemningen torsdag fordømmer USA Russlands veto og anklager dem for å forsøke å skjule sitt militære samarbeidet med Nord-Korea.
– Russland har i dag vist at de kynisk undergraver internasjonal fred og sikkerhet – for å fremme den korrupte avtalen som Russland har inngått med Nord-Korea, sier Matthew Miller, talsmann for amerikansk UD, ifølge Reuters.

Diplomater sier til Reuters at det er lite trolig at det vil bli gjort noe nytt forsøk på å fornye mandatet før det utløper den 30. april 2024.
Russlands veto understreker stadig sterkere bånd mellom Moskva og Pyongyang, sier diplomater til Reuters.
– Et vendepunkt i sanksjonene mot Nord-Korea, sier tidligere medlem av FN-panelet, Aaron Arnold, til Reuters.
– Russlands stemmegivning, sammen med det åpenbare bruddet på sanksjoner ved å kjøpe våpen fra Nord-Korea, gir en pekepinn om at fremtiden er dyster for sanksjonene mot Nord-Korea, sier han.
Russlands FN-ambassadør Vassilij Nebenzja hevdet i debatten at kontrollørenes rapporter om sanksjonene har vært «forutinntatt informasjon» og «avisoverskrifter» og preget av Vesten.
Reuters skriver at «selv ekspertpanelets tilhengere erkjenner at arbeidet deres var begrenset, men skyldte det på kinesiske og russiske medlemmer som blokkerte eller forvirret ufordelaktige funn».
– Russlands veto indikerer at Putin vil styrke samarbeidet med Nord-Korea når det gjelder missiler og dermed bryte sanksjonene, sier Hugh Griffiths, tidligere leder av panelet, til Reuters.",2024-03-29T12:35:17Z,https://www.vg.no,VG
"South Korea's birth rate is so low, one company offers staff a $75,000 incentive to have children","Seoul — South Korea's overall birth rate hit a record low of 0.72 in 2023, and with that figure projected to fall even further in 2024, some Korean businesses have started offering remarkably generous incentives to convince their workers to become parents.
""The declining fertility rate leads to a decline in the workforce and purchasing power and slowing economic growth, which in turn directly affects the sustainability of corporate management, meaning companies need to actively address the issue,"" Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI) president Chul Chung said recently at a Korean-Japanese business seminar dedicated to the topic.
Jin Sung Yoo, a senior research fellow at KERI, said the main reason for South Korea's worryingly low birth rate was the ""effect on career progression"" associated with having children.
Many solutions were discussed at the seminar, and some eye-opening incentives have been announced in recent weeks.
The Lotte Group, a massive cross-industry conglomerate, said it had found success through ""various in-house family-friendly policies."" The company said the existing program had helped push the internal birth rate among employees up to 2.05 during 2022, no small feat when the national average was 0.81.
Ok-keun Cho, head of corporate culture at the Lotte Group, said starting this year, the company would also be offering employees with three or more children a 7-9 seat family vehicle, free of charge.
The most generous parenthood incentive, however, is likely the one for workers at the construction and housing group Booyoung, which has been offering employees a $75,000 bonus for each new child they parent.
So far, the company says 66 employees have taken advantage — at a cost to Booyoung of about $5 million.
Company chairman Lee Joong Keun said he sees it as an investment in the nation's future, warning that if the birth rate continues to fall, ""Korea will face a crisis of national existence 20 years from now, including a decline in the economically productive population and a shortage of defense personnel to ensure national security and maintain order.""
Under South Korea's rules, $75,000 is the largest handout a parent can receive without having to pay additional tax on the month. But Booyoung's boss said he wanted to go even further, announcing that he would work to help provide employees who become the parent of a third child with ""housing with no tax burden on tenants and no maintenance responsibilities.""
The construction company chief said he was hoping to get the South Korean government to agree to provide the land necessary for his plans.
Meanwhile, city officials have said that Seoul's local government plans to invest more than $1.3 billion during 2024 in the Birth Encouragement Project, an upgrade to an existing incentive policy.
The project has been largely focused on helping South Korean's maintain their careers around family planning, but it's been expanded to make more people eligible for the benefits, and those benefits now include infertility treatment and more childcare services.",2024-03-29T12:30:10Z,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News
Russia shuts down UN Watchdog monitoring North Korea sanctions,"13 out of 14 member states supported the panel’s renewal, with China abstaining.
The veto by Russia prompted condemnation from the US, UK, South Korea, and other Western allies.
South Korea’s representative criticized Russia’s “blind self-centeredness” and dismissed the panel’s accusations.

Russia shut down a panel of UN experts that had been monitoring sanctions against North Korea for years. Last week, the panel announced it was investigating reports indicating Russia’s violation of rules by purchasing North Korean weapons, such as ballistic missiles, for use in Ukraine. Since 2006, the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions on Pyongyang for its nuclear weapons program.
The Security Council vote on Thursday resulted in the disbandment of the expert group established to monitor violations of the restrictions, despite the ongoing enforcement of those measures. Russia, exercising its veto power as a permanent member, blocked the renewal, while 13 of the other 14 member states present supported it.
China, North Korea’s closest ally, chose to abstain. The veto by Russia prompted strong condemnation from the US, UK, South Korea, and other Western allies. This action follows a year marked by high-profile public meetings between leaders of Moscow and Pyongyang.
For the first time in 14 years, Russia blocked the renewal of the panel, which has been annually approved by the UN Security Council. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba asserted on social media that Russia’s veto essentially admitted guilt, implying its use of North Korean weapons in the conflict.
The US, UK, and France all accused Russia in the Council, stating that it silenced the watchdog because it had started to report on Moscow’s breaches of the rules, particularly the procurement of weapons from North Korea for deployment in Ukraine’s battlegrounds.
Meanwhile, at the UN, South Korea’s representative criticized Russia’s “blind self-centeredness,” asserting that Russia had no justification for disbanding the guardians of the sanctions regime. Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook likened the action to destroying a CCTV camera to avoid being caught red-handed. Russia’s representative at the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, has consistently denied the use of North Korean weapons and again dismissed the accusations on Thursday. He also argued that the panel of experts provided no added value.

“The panel has continued to focus on trivial matters that are not commensurate with the problems facing the peninsula,” said Mr Nebenzia, who also added that sanctions had imposed a “heavy burden” on the North Korean people.

South Korea launches high-speed train - to help improve country's birth rate by cutting commuting times,"South Korea has come up with a novel idea to get one of its biggest problems back on track – by launching a high speed train service.
The country has the world's lowest birth rate as the average number of expected babies for a South Korean woman during her child-bearing life fell to a record low of 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, according to data from Statistics Korea.
Young people have complained about the cramped living conditions and expensive housing in greater Seoul, plus long commutes, as motives for not getting married and starting a family.
Seoul's birth rate is even lower than the national average and government efforts have failed to reverse the decline with subsidies - 360 trillion won (£213bn) since 2006.
Officials are relying on the Great Train eXpress (GTX) to spur the rates expected to provide six lines linking Seoul to several outlying areas by 2035.

The government is spending 134 trillion won (£78.8bn) on the project.
On Friday, President Yoon Suk Yeol inaugurated a section of the first line, which will cut the commute time from Suseo in the capital to the township of Dongtan, south of Seoul, to 19 minutes instead of 80 minutes by bus.

The branch is to open from Saturday and when the GTX is fully operational is will be one of the fastest underground systems in the world, with trains travelling at speeds of up to 112 mph, officials said.

'How can anyone make time for babies?'
Land Minister Park Sang-woo said the GTX would allow young people to consider homes far away from the capital without having to spend hours commuting.
""With a two-hour commute on the way home, for example, how can anyone make time for babies? The idea is to give people more leisure time after work,"" he said.

iPad Pro Delays Could Be Down to Poor OLED Panel Production Yields,"OLED panel supply issues may be partly behind Apple's iPad Pro launch delay, based on reports coming out of Korea.
Apple's original plan was to rely on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display responsible for the required ~13-inch panels.
The division of labor was reportedly due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies.
Early reports suggested the new models could arrive as soon as this month. However, according to Korean news site hankooki.com, Samsung has recently faced poor yields of the ~11-inch OLED panels, and it has been unable to meet Apple's order quantity. The shortfall has led Apple to transfer some orders for the smaller panel to LG Display. The latter is subsequently expected to increase its order by hundreds of thousands of units going into next month.
Given the reallocation, LG Display is now likely to supply 60% of the panels for the upcoming iPad Pro models. The company has invested millions of dollars into its sixth-generation small- and medium-sized OLED production line, and has now passed Apple's quality control standards for the smaller panels, enabling it to take up the slack from Samsung.
Apple earlier this month ordered an initial 8.5 million OLED display panels from the South Korean suppliers. Apple's latest shipments forecast is said to have been a decrease from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year.
Apple is rumored to be aiming for ""unrivaled"" display quality with the new iPad Pro models, which will use a tandem OLED structure. The tandem structure is a method of stacking two layers of OLED light-emitting layers. It is superior to the luminance (screen brightness) and lifespan of a single OLED structure with one light-emitting layer. The iPhone currently uses a single stack OLED display with one light-emitting layer.
Apple will now introduce new iPad Pro models alongside new iPad Air models in early May, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple is apparently working to ""finish software for the new devices,"" and the iPad Pro models also need ""complex new manufacturing techniques,"" which Gurman says has contributed to the delay.",2024-03-29T10:42:17Z,https://www.macrumors.com,MacRumors
iPhone 16 Pro Models Could Feature New Polished Titanium Finish,"Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will use an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, claims a new rumor out of Korea.
According to news aggregator account ""yeux1122"" on the Naver blog, the new process will make the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max look more polished than the iPhone 15 Pro models, which have a brushed finish.
The improved manufacturing process will allegedly result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in previous Pro iPhones. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.
The ‌‌brushed finish on ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models‌‌ is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones. It is less prone to fingerprints and also reduces scratch visibility. Apart from looks though, Apple's use of a titanium frame for its ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ devices also cut down the weight of the devices. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro Max.
In addition, the titanium frame and aluminum substructure also provides better heat dissipation than any previous-generation Pro models with stainless steel frames, according to Apple.
A rumor earlier this week claimed that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will come in new ""space black"" and ""rose"" titanium colors. The ""rose"" is a gold shade, while ""space black"" could replace the black titanium option. Apple is expected to release the iPhone 16 series in the fall.",2024-03-29T09:20:27Z,https://www.macrumors.com,MacRumors
Russia protects North Korea in the UN with veto of resolution to investigate sanction violations,"By Richard Roth, Catherine Nicholls, Louis Mian and Brad Lendon, CNN
United Nations (CNN) — Russia on Thursday vetoed a United Nations resolution that would renew an independent panel of experts investigating North Korea’s violations of Security Council sanctions, at a time when Pyongyang has become a key supplier of munitions for Moscow’s war against Ukraine.
In recent years, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen a massive buildup in Pyongyang’s ballistic missile program, with dozens of tests in a year, including long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the United States mainland.
International sanctions and UN investigations into North Korea’s illegal weapons program have previously been backed by Russia. But relations between Moscow and the West are at a historic low over the war unleashed on Ukraine. Facing increased international ostracism – and acute ammunition shortages – Russian President Vladimir Putin has grown more reliant on North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un.
North Korea has also gained a powerful backer at the UN which wields veto power.
Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council the UN-imposed sanctions regime on Pyongyang, aimed at stopping North Korea from conducting nuclear tests or launching ballistic missiles, is “losing its relevance” and is “detached from reality,” according to a UN press release.
Since UN Resolution 1718 was passed in 2006 establishing the seven-member panel, sanctions on North Korea have not achieved their aims or contributed to an improved situation on the Korean Peninsula, Russia contended.
Nebenzia said Thursday a coalition of countries led by the US wanted to strangle Pyongyang, a situation that affects Russia’s national security.
While UN sanctions prohibit arms transfers to or from North Korea, the Kim regime has become a big supplier of weapons to Putin’s war effort in Ukraine.
South Korea’s defense minister said in February that North Korea munitions factories are operating at full capacity to produce armaments to send to Russia, including millions of rounds of artillery shells.
Ukraine has also said it has found debris from North Korean-made ballistic missiles after attacks on targets in the country.
The vote in the 15-member Security Council on Thursday was 13 in favor, Russia opposed and China abstaining. But as Russia holds veto power, the resolution to continue the panel of experts’ work failed.
Britain’s Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward called the Russian veto “deeply concerning.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” Woodward told the Security Council. Adding that “it is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.”
“This veto undermines the panel’s work; the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime; and this Council’s credibility in upholding UN Security Council resolutions,” Woodward said, adding that the panel of experts has “played a vital role in constraining” North Korea over the past decade.
US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood asked how a civilized nation could block the approval.
“You silenced the panel of experts today, but you will never silence those in favor of a nonproliferation regime,” Wood said to Russia.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry also called Russia’s decision “irresponsible.”

Alerts issued as yellow dust engulfs South Korea,"SEOUL - Yellow and fine dust blanketed South Korea on March 29 with a thick haze of pollution categorized as “very bad” in the central region of the country, prompting the state weather agency to issue advisories.
Yellow dust advisories for the greater Seoul area, Gangwon and South Chungcheong provinces were raised to “caution,” the second-lowest level in the government’s four-stage crisis alert as of 8am on March 29, according to the Ministry of Environment.
A yellow dust warning is issued when the average hourly concentration of fine particulate matter or PM10 stays above 300 micrograms for longer than two hours.
The Environment Ministry said it has issued North Gyeongsang Province the “attention” level against yellow dust, the lowest in its warning system.
The “attention” level is issued when particulate matter concentrations are forecast to be “very bad.” The weather authorities here categorize concentrations of PM 10 between zero and 30 micrograms as “good,” between 31 and 80 as “normal,” between 81 and 150 as “bad” and more than 151 as “very bad.”
As yellow dust originating near the Inner Mongolia region is being carried into the country by northwesterly winds, the fine dust level across the country is expected to remain at “bad” to “very bad” throughout the day.
The yellow dust is expected to continue to cover the country as it moves southeastward with the northwesterly winds and is expected to continue to affect the country through March 30, according to the weather authorities.
Korea’s national weather agency advised people with respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses, the elderly and children to stay indoors. People should use masks when going outside when fine dust levels are high. The agency also advised avoiding rain, as it contains fine dust particles.

ANALYSIS-Russian veto points to 'grim future' for North Korea sanctions enforcement,"Russia's move to effectively disband the panel of experts monitoring longstanding United Nations sanctions against North Korea points to a ""grim future"" for the sanctions enforcement, three former members of the panel told Reuters.
Russia vetoed the annual renewal of the multinational panel of experts on Thursday, which has spent the last 15 years monitoring U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. China, North Korea's only military ally and its largest trading partner, abstained. Beijing and Moscow have denied breaking sanctions but have blocked new measures at the UN Security Council and advocated lifting some existing sanctions on North Korea, blaming the West and its allies for exacerbating tensions.
Diplomats said it appeared unlikely there would be another vote to try to renew the mandate before it expires on April 30. The veto highlights a rare diplomatic dividend for Pyongyang and underlines its deepening ties with Moscow, which have included unprecedented shipments of ballistic missiles and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine as well as possible fuel supplies for North Korea, according to U.S. and South Korean officials and independent analysts.
Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen military relations and Russia's spy chief visited North Korea this week to vow a united front against ""attempts to increase pressure from external forces."" The vote was significant and represents a major turning point in the international sanctions regime against North Korea, said Aaron Arnold, a former member of the panel who now works as a sanctions expert at Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
""Russia's vote, along with its blatant violation of sanctions by buying conventional arms from North Korea, years long history of ignoring their obligations, and at least tacit support from China suggest that the future is grim for the DPRK sanctions regime,"" he said, using the initials of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia criticized the experts' work, saying before the vote that its reports had been reduced to ""playing into the hands of Western approaches, reprinting biased information and analysing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos."" Even the panel's backers acknowledge that its work was increasingly constrained, but blamed it on Chinese and Russian members blocking or obfuscating unfavourable findings.
""The latest report is very interesting, because although it goes into some useful detail on finance and on overseas workers, China is barely mentioned,"" said one former senior member who asked not to be named because of diplomatic sensitivities. ""If you're talking about breaching the sanctions, and not mentioning China, that's not really a terribly accurate reflection of what is really going on."" While the panel reports looked like a comprehensive summary, they were more like a small part of a larger puzzle, often with some of the most important pieces left out, the former member said.
The end of the panel could lead to more trilateral cooperation among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, and more evidence of sanctions violations could be released to the public since the restraining influence Russia and China had over headline-generating reports will be gone with the UN panel of experts, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. Because global banks and insurance companies have come to rely on independent reports to freeze and close accounts associated with North Korean overseas sanctions evasion networks, continued reporting mechanisms will be found, said Hugh Griffiths, former head of the panel and now a sanctions consultant.
DEEPER RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA TIES Griffiths said the veto suggests Russia does not want its illegal procurement of North Korean ballistic missiles and conventional artillery munitions to be reported by a UN Security Council body.
""Russia's veto indicates that Putin will intensify his ballistic missile and embargo-busting cooperation with North Korea,"" he said. The vote illustrates how strong the ties between Russia-North Korea have become, said Jenny Town of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring programme.
""It underscores that no new sanctions at the UN Security Council level should be expected in the current geopolitical environment, and the bigger burden on states now to handle sanctions monitoring efforts,"" she said. The United States and South Korea launched a new task force this week aimed at preventing North Korea from procuring illicit oil, particularly from Russia.
The two countries also imposed unilateral sanctions on individuals and entities based in Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of channelling funds to Pyongyang's weapons programs. South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North, called the vote ""extremely regrettable.""
Most visible sanctions enforcement has already been headed by the United States and its partners, sometimes in conflict with China or Russia. Canada accused Chinese jets of ""recklessly"" harassing its surveillance planes taking part in an U.N. operation to enforce sanctions against North Korea. Beijing called the Canadian flights ""provocative.""

"Russia veto ends UN monitoring of sanctions on North Korea; US calls it 'reckless', South Korea terms it 'irresponsible'","The Russian veto of the United Nations panel’s renewal comes weeks after the body said it was probing allegations of weapons transfer from North Korea to Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine War
The United States, South Korea joined other nations to slam Russia who vetoed the renewal of a panel of United Nations (UN) experts to monitor sanctions on North Korea. They went on to accuse Moscow of colluding with Pyongyang.
The Russian veto of the UN panel’s renewal comes weeks after the body said it was probing reports of weapons transfer from North Korea to Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine War.

Following Russia’s veto, the US termed the move as “reckless” and one that “undermined international peace and security”. South Korea termed the Russian decision as “irresponsible decision”.
On its part, Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzia said that the sanctions on North Korea were unjustified without annual review and potential modifications. He further told the UNSC members that the West was trying to “strangle” North Korea and sanctions have proven to be “irrelevant” and “detached from reality”.
Referring to the reported weapons deals between North Korea and Russia, UK’s UN envoy Barbara Woodward said Russia’s vote was not out of concern for North Koreans but it was “about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine”.
What was UN vote about?

The UNSC, on Thursday, voted on the proposed renewal of a UN panel to monitor sanctions on North Korea. The panel is formally called the ‘Panel of Experts assisting the Sanctions Committee’ which was established in 2006.
If the resolution would have passed in the voting, the panel would have been renewed till April 30, 2025.

The UN, in a release said, the passage would have also included a UNSC request to the panel to submit its confidential midterm report by August 23 and its final report by February 14, 2025.
Of the 15 members of the UNSC, Russia vetoed the proposed renewal of the panel while China abstained from voting. The 13 other members, including the permanent UNSC members the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, all voted for the renewal.
US terms vote ‘collusion’, Ukraine says Russia entered ‘guilty plea’.

The US condemned the Russian veto and linked it to the alleged Russian procurement of North Korean weapons. US Deputy UN envoy Robert Wood said Russia was attempting to silence the UN panel’s “independent objective investigations” because it “began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the UN Security Council resolutions”.

He further said the move will embolden North Korea to keep adversely affecting the world security with its development of “long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts”.
For months, the US has been alleging that Russia is procuring arms and ammunition from North Korea in violations of international sanctions to use in its war on Ukraine. In return for weapons sales to Russia amid the war, North Korea is understood to be seeking fighter jets and ballistic-missile launch technology, said White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby in January.
Separately, in a statement following Russia’s vote, Kirby termed it “reckless action” that undermined sanctions against North Korea. He also warned against the deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia. He further said, “The international community should resolutely uphold the global nonproliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression.”
Referring to the alleged Russia-North Korea weapons deals, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on social media that the Russian veto amounted to “a guilty plea”.
UK’s UN envoy Barbara Woodward said, “This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions. It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine…This panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia.”
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), France’s UN envoy Nicolas de Riviere expressed “deep regrets” over the Russian veto. He said, “France deeply regrets the Russian veto which put a stop to the renewal of the mandate of the 1718 Sanctions Committee’s panel of experts. This veto purposely ends their work of reporting on North Korea’s arms deliveries to Russia, in violation of the Security Council resolutions.”

South Korea slammed Russia’s veto as “irresponsible” and pointed out that Russia “despite its status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has made an irresponsible decision”. Separately, Korean UN envoy Hwang Joonkook also said that the North Korea’s continued provocations and sanctions evasion, the role of the panel was all the more essential.

Russian veto brings an end to the U.N. panel that monitors North Korea nuclear sanctions,"UNITED NATIONS — A veto Thursday by Russia ended monitoring of U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, prompting Western accusations that Moscow is seeking to avoid scrutiny as it allegedly violates the sanctions to buy weapons from Pyongyang for its war in Ukraine.
Russia’s turnaround on the U.N. monitoring reflects how Moscow’s growing animosity with the United States and its Western allies since the start of the Ukraine war has made it difficult to reach consensus on even issues where there has been longstanding agreement.
The veto came during a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have extended the mandate of a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on North Korea for a year, but which will now halt its operation when its current mandate expires at the end of April.
The vote in the 15-member council, with 13 in favor, Russia against, and China abstaining, has no impact on the actual sanctions against North Korea, which remain in force.
Russia had never before tried to block the work of the panel of experts, which had been renewed annually by the U.N. Security Council for 14 years and reflected global opposition to North Korea’s expanding nuclear weapons program.
Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote that Western nations are trying to “strangle” North Korea and that sanctions are losing their “relevance” and are “detached from reality” in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the country.
He accused the panel of experts of “increasingly being reduced to playing into the hands of Western approaches, reprinting biased information and analyzing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos.” Therefore, he said, it is “essentially conceding its inability to come up with sober assessments of the status of the sanctions regime.”
But U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood called the panel’s work essential and accused Russia of attempting to silence its “independent objective investigations” because it “began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.”
He warned that Russia’s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardizing global security through development “of long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts.”
White House national security spokesman John Kirby condemned Russia’s veto as a “reckless action” that undermines sanctions imposed on North Korea, while warning against the deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia, particularly as North Korea continues to supply Russia with weapons as it wages its war in Ukraine.
“The international community should resolutely uphold the global nonproliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression,” Kirby told reporters.
Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” she said. “It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.”
“This panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,” Woodward said.
France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere added that “North Korea has been providing Russia with military material in support of its aggression against Ukraine, in violation of many resolutions which Russia voted in favor of.”
Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky responded, calling these “unfounded insinuations” that “only strengthened our conviction that we took the right decision to not support the extension of the panel of experts.”
The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches.
The Security Council established a committee to monitor sanctions and the mandate for its panel of experts to investigate violations had been renewed for 14 years until Thursday.",2024-03-29T06:18:33Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
South Korea’s ambassador to Australia steps down amid investigation controversy,"SEOUL - South Korea’s ambassador to Australia resigned on March 29 as questions about his appointment while he is under a corruption probe battered President Yoon Suk-yeol’s ruling party less than two weeks from a closely fought parliamentary election.
Mr Lee Jong-sup, who was appointed ambassador to Australia just four weeks ago, is being investigated over allegations that he tried to improperly influence a probe into the death of a marine in 2023 while he was defence minister.
“His resignation was reported to the President, and it has been decided it will be accepted,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Reuters could not immediately contact Mr Lee for comment.
Mr Lee has previously denied any wrongdoing and said he was willing to cooperate fully with the investigation.
Criticism of Mr Lee’s appointment grew sharply when he flew to Canberra on March 10, which opposition party members decried as an attempt to evade questioning in the case.
Some members of Mr Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) have also said he was the wrong choice for an ambassador, and it was a mistake for him to leave.
Mr Lee returned to Seoul last week for what he said were official meetings and said he hoped to have the chance to answer questions by the national corruption agency handling the case.
But the outcry over his appointment and his hasty departure did not end, and some PPP members said he was a political burden for the party as it tries to win back control of Parliament in the April 10 elections.
The anti-corruption agency is investigating Mr Lee over allegations he was behind a government attempt to interfere with a probe into the death of a marine who was involved in a search and rescue operation during floods in 2023.

СЕУЛ, 29 мар — РИА Новости. Южнокорейская газета The Korea Herald извинилась за карикатуру на теракт в подмосковном ""Крокус Сити Холле"", которую ранее раскритиковало посольство России в Сеуле, извинения были опубликованы в печатной версии издания. Ранее посольство России в Южной Корее назвало кощунственной и циничной карикатуру англоязычной газеты The Korea Herald на теракт в ""Крокусе"", заявив, что она оскорбляет чувства большинства южнокорейских граждан, разделяющих с россиянами боль этой трагедии. ""The Korea Herald выражает глубокие соболезнования жертвам трагической террористической атаки в ""Крокус Сити Холле"" 22 марта вместе с народом и разделяет эту необъятную скорбь. В этой связи мы глубоко сожалеем о публикации синдицированной карикатуры в номере газеты от 27 марта. Мы сожалеем об этой оплошности, признаем и уважаем чувства тех, кто был оскорблен данной карикатурой"", — говорится в заметке, опубликованной на первой странице печатной версии газеты, где изначально была опубликована карикатура. Издание еще раз повторило, что осознает свою ответственность за публикуемые материалы и выражает ""глубочайшие сожаления"". Стрельба и пожар произошли вечером 22 марта перед концертом в ""Крокус Сити Холле"" в подмосковном Красногорске. Корреспондент РИА Новости, ставший свидетелем произошедшего, сообщал, что в зал ворвались несколько мужчин в камуфляже и без масок, они расстреливали людей в упор и бросали зажигательные шашки. По последним данным МЧС, погибли 143 человека. Четырех предполагаемых исполнителей теракта задержали 23 марта в Брянской области. Впоследствии Далерджон Мирзоев, Муродали Рачабализода, Фаридуни Шамсиддин и Мухаммадсобир Файзов были арестованы в Москве по обвинению в совершении теракта, повлекшего смерть, в составе организованной группы (пункт ""б"" части 3 статьи 205 УК России). Президент России Владимир Путин отмечал, что всего задержаны 11 человек и силовики работают над вскрытием всей пособнической базы террористов. По его словам, теракт был совершен руками радикальных исламистов. Директор ФСБ Александр Бортников отмечал, что одни исламисты не смогли бы подготовить этот теракт, им помогали. Он отметил, что первичные данные от задержанных подтверждают украинский след, в российских спецслужбах думают, что за терактом стоят США, Британия и Украина. Путин отмечал, что Россия столкнулась не просто с тщательно цинично спланированным терактом, а с подготовленным и организованным массовым убийством мирных людей. Президент подчеркнул, что все исполнители, организаторы и заказчики этого преступления понесут справедливое и неизбежное наказание.

It comes amid a corruption investigation, which is examining allegations that he tampered with a South Korean Marine Corps' inquiry into a soldier's death What's next? On Friday, the South Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed his resignation.
South Korea's new ambassador to Australia has resigned after less than a month in the job, as he faces a corruption probe at home.
On March 4, Lee Jong-sup was named by President Yoon Suk Yeol's conservative administration to replace Kim Wan-joong in Canberra.
The former defence minister then flew to Australia on March 12 to take up the position as top envoy after South Korea's justice ministry lifted a travel ban on him to allow him to leave.
But he was forced home 10 days later amid an investigation by the country's Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials over allegations he interfered with a probe into the drowning of a South Korean soldier.
Mr Lee has denied any wrongdoing.
Opposition MPs accused the government of sending Mr Lee to Australia to shield him from facing justice.
The appointment proved highly controversial and politically poisonous ahead of parliamentary elections in April, and members of South Korea's diaspora in Australia protested the decision outside of Parliament House.

On Friday, the South Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed his resignation.
""His resignation was reported to the president and it has been decided it will be accepted,"" it said in a statement.
John Lee, the editor of the online publication, Korea Pro, said the saga was an ""embarrassment"" to the government and the president.
""The main opposition Democratic Party claimed that appointing Mr Lee as ambassador to Australia was tantamount to helping a suspected criminal avoid investigation and potential prosecution,"" he said.
""This is a bad look, especially considering the fact that President Yoon Suk-yeol is a former prosecutor.""
The accusations against Lee Jong-sup
In July last year, a South Korean marine, Lance Corporal Chae Su-geun, was swept away by strong river currents during a search and rescue operation.
It was revealed he had not been equipped with a life jacket.
Military investigator, Colonel Park Jung-hun, recommended eight officers be charged with ""professional negligence leading to manslaughter"".
It's alleged Mr Lee pressured authorities to hold off from revealing the findings.
After the report was handed over to police, Colonel Park was charged with insubordination.
The union that represents reserve marines told the ABC the ambassador's offer to resign was a ""relief"".
""We were all extremely outraged,"" said Marine Corps Reserve National Association president Jung Won Chul.
""Why did they send out such an individual to Australia?
""His appointment was not only unsuitable for the investigation into the Chae Su-geun case but also detrimental to the relationship between the two countries. It was a significant diplomatic misstep.
""There was a worry that the major witness fleeing might hinder the investigation and trial proceedings.""

Russia protects North Korea in the UN with veto of resolution to investigate sanction violations,"United Nations CNN —
Russia on Thursday vetoed a United Nations resolution that would renew an independent panel of experts investigating North Korea’s violations of Security Council sanctions, at a time when Pyongyang has become a key supplier of munitions for Moscow’s war against Ukraine.
In recent years, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen a massive buildup in Pyongyang’s ballistic missile program, with dozens of tests in a year, including long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the United States mainland.
International sanctions and UN investigations into North Korea’s illegal weapons program have previously been backed by Russia. But relations between Moscow and the West are at a historic low over the war unleashed on Ukraine. Facing increased international ostracism – and acute ammunition shortages – Russian President Vladimir Putin has grown more reliant on North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un.
North Korea has also gained a powerful backer at the UN which wields veto power.
Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council the UN-imposed sanctions regime on Pyongyang, aimed at stopping North Korea from conducting nuclear tests or launching ballistic missiles, is “losing its relevance” and is “detached from reality,” according to a UN press release.
Video Ad Feedback A timeline of North Korea's recent missile tests 02:22 - Source: CNN
Since UN Resolution 1718 was passed in 2006 establishing the seven-member panel, sanctions on North Korea have not achieved their aims or contributed to an improved situation on the Korean Peninsula, Russia contended.
Nebenzia said Thursday a coalition of countries led by the US wanted to strangle Pyongyang, a situation that affects Russia’s national security.
While UN sanctions prohibit arms transfers to or from North Korea, the Kim regime has become a big supplier of weapons to Putin’s war effort in Ukraine.
South Korea’s defense minister said in February that North Korea munitions factories are operating at full capacity to produce armaments to send to Russia, including millions of rounds of artillery shells.
Ukraine has also said it has found debris from North Korean-made ballistic missiles after attacks on targets in the country.
The vote in the 15-member Security Council on Thursday was 13 in favor, Russia opposed and China abstaining. But as Russia holds veto power, the resolution to continue the panel of experts’ work failed.
Britain’s Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward called the Russian veto “deeply concerning.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” Woodward told the Security Council. Adding that “it is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.”
“This veto undermines the panel’s work; the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime; and this Council’s credibility in upholding UN Security Council resolutions,” Woodward said, adding that the panel of experts has “played a vital role in constraining” North Korea over the past decade.
US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood asked how a civilized nation could block the approval.
“You silenced the panel of experts today, but you will never silence those in favor of a nonproliferation regime,” Wood said to Russia.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry also called Russia’s decision “irresponsible.”",2024-03-29T04:00:00Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network

Russia criticised for blocking renewal of UN monitors of North Korea,"Russia has blocked the renewal of a UN panel monitoring sanctions against North Korea, weeks after the body said it was investigating reports of arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.
The move was met with a flurry of criticism, including by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who took to social media to call the veto “a guilty plea” amid allegations that Pyongyang is aiding Moscow in its war against Kyiv.
The United States called the veto by Russia a “self-interested effort to bury the panel’s reporting on its own collusion” with North Korea.
Moscow’s veto at the security council does not remove the sanctions on North Korea, but spells the end for the group monitoring their implementation – and myriad alleged violations. The panel’s mandate expires at the end of April.
Russia had never previously tried to block the work of the panel of experts, which had been renewed annually by the UN security council for 14 years and reflected global opposition to North Korea’s expanding nuclear weapon programme.
Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote that western nations were trying to “strangle” North Korea and that sanctions are losing their “relevance” and “detached from reality” in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the country.
But US deputy ambassador Robert Wood called the panel’s work essential and accused Russia of attempting to silence its “independent objective investigations” because it “began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the UN security council resolutions.”
He said Russia’s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardising global security through development “of long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts”.
Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of UN sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” she said. “It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.
“This panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia.”
France’s UN ambassador Nicolas de Riviere added that “North Korea has been providing Russia with military material in support of its aggression against Ukraine, in violation of many resolutions which Russia voted in favour of.”
The security council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking – so far unsuccessfully – to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a US-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches.
The security council established a committee to monitor sanctions and the mandate for its panel of experts to investigate violations had been renewed for 14 years until Thursday.
In its most recent report circulated last month, the panel of experts said it is investigating 58 suspected North Korean cyber-attacks between 2017 and 2023 valued at approximately $3bn, with the money reportedly being used to help fund its development of weapons of mass destruction.
The experts said North Korea continues to flout sanctions, including by further developing its nuclear weapons, and producing nuclear fissile materials – the weapons’ key ingredients. It also continues to import refined petroleum products in violation of council resolutions.",2024-03-28T21:28:25Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"World News in Brief: Russia vetoes DPR Korea sanctions resolution, children under fire in Sudan, drought plagues Malawi","A United States resolution to extend the mandate of an expert panel which monitors sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was vetoed by Russia in the Security Council on Thursday. This in effect abolishes the monitoring of UN sanctions against the country, more commonly known as North Korea, blocking the extension of the panel for another year. Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the sanctions regime adopted with the intention of preventing nuclear weapons proliferation, was losing its relevance and also ""to a great extent, detached from reality."" He said that an ""unprecedented"" Western-led policy was in place to ""strangle Pyongyang"", including harsh unilateral sanctions, ""aggressive propaganda"" and ""direct personal threats"". He said the ""active militarization"" of the Korean Peninsula due to action by the NATO alliance was making matters worse, and directly threatening Russia's interests in the region. ### China abstains The vote in the 15-member Council was 13 in favour, Russia against and China abstaining. ![Deputy Permanent Representative Robert A.

The US Deputy Permanent Representative Robert Wood said that Russia's veto was nothing more than an attempt ""to silence the independent objective investigations into DPRK Security Council violations."" He said the veto had been used solely because the panel had in recent months begun reporting on ""blatant violations"" and persistent sanctions-busting ""within Russia's jurisdiction."" He said today's vote would only embolden North Korea to act with impunity. The Republic of Korea's Ambassador Hwang Joonkook told the Council before the vote that the panel of experts had been faithfully carrying out its duty for 15 years, and their work played a ""crucial role"" towards better sanctions implementation. He said faced with DPRK's continued provocations and sanctions evasion, the role of the panel was all the more essential.

The alert from the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, follows a recent mission to the city of Omdurman near Khartoum, where one hospital performed 300 amputations in a month, and where two to three patients share a bed. Jill Lawler, UNICEF Chief of Field Operations in Sudan, said that millions have been affected and displaced across the country. Listen to the full interview below where she describes the predicament of young mothers who are too weak to breastfeed their babies: Soundcloud UNICEF says that 24 million children in Sudan have been exposed to conflict and a staggering 730,000 are severely acutely malnourished. Some women and girls who were raped in the first months of the war are now delivering babies, the UN agency has learned, while many young people can also be seen carrying arms. Although humanitarian supplies are available in Port Sudan, the key challenge is securing safe aid access to affected populations, UNICEF said. ## **UN and partners support Malawi's battle against severe drought** The UN and aid partners are assisting Malawi's efforts to respond to a severe drought in the African nation which has prompted the Government to declare a state of emergency. So far, 23 out of 28 districts are on alert, amounting to around nine million people, or two million rural families. ![A health worker at a camp in southern Malawi, talks to displaced people about cholera prevention measures.](https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production%20Library/16-01-2023-UNICEF- Malawi-UN0809638.jpg/image1170x530cropped.jpg) © UNICEF/Thoko Chikondi A health worker at a camp in southern Malawi, talks to displaced people about cholera prevention measures.

Russland legger ned veto mot panel som overvåker Nord-Korea,"Russland kan med sitt veto i Sikkerhetsrådet sørge for å beskytte stater som Nord-Korea. Nylig la Russland ned veto mot at et panel som overvåker internasjonale sanksjoner mot Nord-Korea kan få fornyet sitt mandat. Kina avsto.
Russlands veto betyr ikke at sanksjonene fjernes, men at gjennomføringen av dem, i tillegg til påståtte brudd på dem, ikke lenger kan overvåkes av et panel som årlig får sitt mandat av FNs sikkerhetsråd. Årsaken til vetoen er at panelet ifølge Russland er uberettiget uten en årlig gjennomgang for å vurdere og potensielt endre sanksjonene. (NTB)
Det tegner seg en ny akse mellom Russland, Nord-Korea, Kina og Iran, som har gjort at Russland har overlevd sanksjonene. Disse landene vil ikke at Vesten skal kunne diktere Russland.",2024-03-28T19:51:22Z,https://www.document.no,Document.no
'Wean itself off Nvidia': Samsung signs $750 million agreement with South Korea's largest online platform — Naver wants to replace Nvidia's super expensive AI GPU with the more affordable Mach-1 chip,"In a move to cut its dependency on Nvidia's high-cost AI chips, Naver, the South Korean equivalent of Google, has signed a 1 trillion won ($750 million) agreement with Samsung.
The deal will see the tech giant supply its more affordable Mach-1 chips to Naver, by the end of 2024.
The Mach-1 chip, currently under development, is an AI accelerator in the form of a SoC that combines Samsung’s proprietary processors and low-power DRAM chips to reduce the bottleneck between the GPU and HBM.
Just the start
The announcement of the Mach-1 was made during Samsung’s 55th regular shareholders' meeting. Kye Hyun Kyung, CEO of Samsung Semiconductor, said the chip design had passed technological validation on FPGAs and that finalization of SoC was in progress.
The exact volume of Mach-1 chips to be supplied and prices are still under discussion, but The Korea Economic Daily reports that Samsung intends to price the Mach-1 AI chip at around $3,756 each. The order is expected to be for somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 units.
Naver plans to use Samsung’s Mach-1 chips to power servers for its AI map service, Naver Place. According to The Korea Economic Daily, Naver will order further Mach-1 chips if the initial batch performs as well as hoped.
Samsung sees this deal with Naver as just the start. The tech giant is reportedly in supply talks with Microsoft and Meta Platforms who, like Naver, are actively seeking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia’s AI hardware.

With the Naver deal, Samsung is also looking to better compete with its South Korean rival SK Hynix, which is the dominant player in the advanced HBM segment. Samsung has been heavily investing in HBM recently and at the start of March announced the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E 12H DRAM. This reportedly outperforms Micron's 24GB 8H HBM3E in terms of capacity and bandwidth and is expected to begin shipping in Q2 this year.",2024-03-28T19:04:11Z,https://www.techradar.com,TechRadar
Russia only nation to veto UN monitoring of sanctions of North Korea,"Russia was the only nation to veto the annual renewal of a panel of experts who monitor the enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile activities.
The block comes as the US has accused Pyongyang of transferring weapons to the Kremlin, which Russia has used in the Ukraine war.
Both countries have denied the allegations but said there was a desire to strengthen military relations last year.
Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un met at Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome in September, when the North Korean leader had pledged his support to Moscow to ""fight against imperialism"".
Mr Kim also said he was ""convinced"" that the ""heroic Russian army"" would triumph in its war with Ukraine - a conflict he referred to by the Kremlin's preferred term of ""special military operation"".

China abstained from the vote on Thursday, while the remaining 13 council members - including permanent seats of the UK, US and France - all voted in favour of renewing the group of experts which has monitored UN sanctions for the past 15 years.
The mandate for the current panel is to expire on 30 April 2024.
The veto comes almost a week after Moscow's Crocus City Hall was attacked, leaving more than 140 people dead.
In response to Russia's decision, Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the UN, said: ""Moscow has undermined the prospect of the peaceful, diplomatic resolution of one of the world's most dangerous nuclear proliferation issues.""

South Korea's UN ambassador Joonkook Hwang said: ""This is almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid
being caught red-handed.""
Meanwhile, Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the council before the vote that Western nations were trying to ""strangle"" North Korea and sanctions have proven ""irrelevant"" and ""detached from reality"" in limiting its nuclear mission.
Mr Nebenzia criticised the experts' previous monitoring saying they were ""playing into the hands"" of the West by adopting biased strategies.

North Korea has been under several UN Security Council sanctions since 2006, including banning the trade of weapons and military equipment and freezing the assets of people involved in nuclear activities.
However, the totalitarian state has not denuclearised and even vowed to increase the country's stock of nuclear weapons this year.

Raser etter Russlands Nord-Korea-grep,"Russland la torsdag ned veto mot den årlige fornyelsen av FNs ekspertpanel som overvåker etterlevelsen av sanksjoner mot Nord-Korea.
Panelet har den siste tida offentliggjort en rapport, der det framkommer at de etterforsker dusinvis av mistenkte cyberangrep fra Nord-Korea. Regimet skal ha tjent tre milliarder dollar på dette, som hevdes å gå til landets atomvåpenprogram.
Ifølge Reuters reagerer Sør-Koreas FN-ambassadør sterkt, og hinter til anklagene om at Russland importerer våpen fra Nord-Korea til bruk i Ukraina.

Hancom InSpace orders more Spire satellites with Hancom-2 in limbo,"TAMPA, Fla. — South Korea’s Hancom InSpace has ordered two more remote sensing satellites from Spire Global as the status of a cubesat ordered two years ago remains up in the air.
Spire said March 27 it will build and operate Sejong-2 and Sejong-3 on behalf of Hancom InSpace to join Sejong-1, a six-unit (6U) cubesat that Vienna, Virginia-headquartered Spire deployed in May 2022 under a payload-hosting agreement with the South Korean firm.
Three months after SpaceX launched Sejong-1 (also known as Hancom-1), Spire said it would provide another 6U imaging cubesat called Hancom-2 for a launch in the second half of 2023.
However, that launch never happened and Spire said its teams are currently discussing plans for Hancom-2 internally, without giving details.
“Our teams are internally discussing and planning the Hancom missions, and we will share more updates as we have them,” Frank Frulio, general manager of space services at Spire, told SpaceNews.
“Our focus is on our current collaboration with Hancom, where we are building and operating Sejong-2 and Sejong-3 satellites to complement Sejong-1 for a three-satellite remote sensing image data service.”
Spire spokesperson Sarah Freeman declined to comment on the size of the Sejong-2 and Sejong-3 satellites but said they would be the same as each other.
Most of the more than 100 cubesats Spire operates — mainly supporting its own maritime, aviation, and weather data and analysis services — are 3U in size, although the company has been branching out into bigger cubesats, such as the 16U platform unveiled in 2022. A standard cubesat measures 10 centimeters a side.
Freeman said Sejong-2 would have an optical imager and serve as an extension of Sejong-1, focusing on maritime and agricultural monitoring, especially in urban areas.
Sejong-3 would be equipped with a hyperspectral imager for applications such as calculating wildfire damage area, analyzing air pollution levels, and assessing river water quality.
Spire declined to say when Sejong-2 and Sejong-3 could launch.
Hancom InSpace, a spin-off from South Korea’s space agency specializing in image analysis for tracking vehicles and changes in infrastructure and the environment, has plans for up to 50 satellites.",2024-03-28T14:51:12Z,https://spacenews.com,SpaceNews

Why thousands of doctors are protesting in South Korea,"For around six weeks now, thousands of junior doctors have walked off their jobs in South Korea and refused to see patients. They have been protesting against a government plan that intends to sharply increase medical school admissions and the number of physicians in the country.
More and more doctors are joining the agitation. In the latest escalation, senior doctors at major hospitals have come out in support, going as far as submitting their resignation letters in protest. What are the issues here? We explain.
Why are South Korean doctors protesting?
The junior doctors said their protests are rooted in the present working conditions and the existing pay. They demand that the government should first address these issues before attempting to increase the number of working physicians in South Korea.

The South Korean government, however, argued that the country needs more working doctors to address the needs of residents in rural parts of the country and meet healthcare demands.
With junior doctors sitting in protest, the functioning of hospitals has also been impacted across the country. A shortage of working doctors has meant that surgical procedures are being cancelled and even emergency rooms have had to turn back patients.
However, doctors have said these issues highlight the workload they have to deal with and that the current system is broken.
According to a Korea Times report, the five biggest hospitals in Seoul — Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul Asan Medical Center, Samsung Medical Center, Severance Hospital and Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital — play a key role in providing medical care for patients in critical conditions. Junior doctors account for 39 per cent of their staff.

Keeping the number of junior doctors high is intentional, mainly because of their lower labour costs, The Korea Times reported.
According to a Reuters report, junior doctors or trainees typically work 80 to 100 hours, five days a week – meaning up to 20 hours a day. Protesting doctors said these working conditions need to be addressed by hiring more senior staff and not increasing the number of trainees or junior doctors.
What has the government said?
The South Korean government has said the increase in the number of doctors is intended to fill an expected shortfall of some 15,000 doctors by 2035. These are significant numbers for a country like South Korea, with a smaller population than India. Following the protests, the government issued a back-to-work order to doctors who walked off the job and vowed to prosecute those who did not comply.
This week, however, the government shifted from its stance and said that it would be “open to dialogue and welcome suggestions to improve its plan,” a report in The Korea Times said. Additionally, the government has also asked the country’s military hospitals and police hospitals to accept civilian patients to prevent further continued disruption of medical services.

But in February, when the protests first started, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol had said the protesting doctors were holding patients “hostage” by their actions. A Korea Times report quoted him as saying: “The government is pushing to reform the country’s health care system”.
He added, “The decision is not negotiable, as adding 2,000 slots (to the number of medical school seats) is deemed a minimal increase to implement the constitutional responsibility of the state to provide timely and proper medical treatment to sick people.”
Despite a softening of the government’s stance, senior doctors at major hospitals in South Korea began submitting their resignations this week in support of medical interns and residents, although they have promised to continue working despite the resignations.
The Korea Times reported that senior doctors have “demanded the government first scrap the decision to increase the medical school quota by 2,000 from the current 3,058, saying it would sit down for talks with the government only if the plan is abolished.”
What the medical community has said

Healthcare in South Korea is among the best in the world, analysts said. Many in the country’s medical community said that the number of doctors is not a problem. According to a Reuters report, South Korea’s medical community believes that the number cited by the government that it wants to use to boost medical admissions is arbitrary and the authorities have not made the basis for that figure open to the public.
The Reuters report quoted the medical community in South Korea as saying that without addressing underlying problems of pay and overwork among junior doctors, there is no incentive for the increased number of doctors to practise the essential discipline.",2024-03-28T14:18:01Z,https://indianexpress.com,The Indian Express
Russia May Have Collected More Weapons From North Korea,"A massive cargo plane with an alleged record of smuggling North Korean weapons has been tracked returning from an apparent pit stop in the hermit kingdom.
The Antonov An-12 is one of several aircraft and Russia-flagged cargo ships that are suspected to have facilitated weapons shipments in violation of international sanctions since at least last year.
The U.S. and South Korea have accused the Kim Jong Un regime of providing the Kremlin with missiles, artillery shells, and other weaponry to replenish the Russian military as it runs through equipment and ammunition in its invasion of Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied that such transfers are taking place.
Early on March 21, an Antonov An-124 operated by Russian state-owned company the 224th Flight Unit was making its way to the far-east Russian city Vladivostok on an apparent return route from North Korea, analysts at NK Pro said on Wednesday, citing flight tracking data.
The plane was tracked leaving Vladivostok at about 2:30 a.m. local time. It then switched off its transponder and went dark, a common practice for Russian aircraft and cargo ships that have been spotted in North Korea shortly afterward.
The Antonov An-124 is even likelier to have stopped in the North Korean capital considering that another Russian state-owned plane—one that did not turn off its transponder—was tracked making the Vladivostok-Pyongyang journey just hours earlier, according to NK Pro.
That plane made the return leg of the trip around the time the Antonov An-124 is believed to have touched down.
Newsweek reached out to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, the Russian foreign ministry, and the U.S. State Department via written requests for comment.
One of the biggest cargo planes in operation, the An-124 has sufficient space to load fighter jets, transporter erector launchers, missiles, and other bulky weapons and weapons platforms.

The 224th Flight Unit is subject to punitive measures from several countries including the United States, which slapped sanctions on the enterprise in January.
The U.S. Treasury Department also separately sanctioned the Antonov An-124 (registration number RA-82030) that carried out the March 21 flight, saying it had been involved in North Korean ""ballistic missiles and missile-related cargo transfers in late November 2023.""
The aircraft's apparent stop in Pyongyang came just a few days after North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un presided over his country's first ballistic missile test in two months.
In the drills, North Korean forces simultaneously launched six 600-millimeter missiles that Pyongyang has said can be fitted with nuclear warheads.",2024-03-28T11:25:35Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Coway Water Purifiers Certified for Microplastic Removal,"26 direct-flow water purifiers and 3 NanoTrap filters certified by the WQA for meeting NSF/ANSI 401 standards
40 Reverse Osmosis (RO) water purifiers recognized for microplastic removal by Intertek
SEOUL, South Korea, March 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — An analysis by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) suggests that the average person ingests as many as 5 grams of microplastics weekly – that’s the equivalent of eating a whole credit card. While the exact effects of plastics on human health are still relatively unknown, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted potential adverse effects, such as the production of reactive oxidative species and inflammatory responses in the body.
Coway, the Best Life Solution Company and a leader in the global water purifier industry, has taken proactive steps to combat environmental pollution and potential health risks associated with microplastics. Coway has certified its water purifiers for their performance and microplastic removal with the assistance of international bodies.
NSF/ANSI 401 Standards for Direct-flow Water Purifiers
The current NSF/ANSI 401 standards, designated by the USA’s National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), are the only standards for the microplastic reduction performance of water filtration systems. A certified water filtration system is proven to remove fine particles ranging from 0.5 to 1 micrometer in size, including microplastics[1].
To date, 26 of Coway’s direct-flow water purifiers, a.k.a NanoTrap water purifiers, and 3 NanoTrap filters have been certified as conforming to the NSF/ANSI 401 standards by the Water Quality Association (WQA). The water filtration systems, such as the Icon Water Purifier (CP-7211N), have over 99% reduction efficiency of particles — a testament to Coway’s commitment to water safety.
Intertek Recognitions for RO Water Purifiers
Coway’s reverse osmosis (RO) membrane water purifiers, widely used in Southeast Asian households, have been verified for microplastic removal performance through stringent testing by Intertek, a leading international certification organization.
Since there are currently no global standards for microplastic removal for RO systems, Coway, in collaboration with Intertek, established the test protocol[2] that verifies the reduction of nano-sized particles as small as 30 nanometers – approximately 1000th of a human hair.
By Intertek’s validation for microplastic removal performance, Coway’s reverse osmosis water purifiers are verified to reduce nanoparticles with an efficiency of over 99%. To date, 40 models of Coway water purifiers have been confirmed to be effective in removing of nano-sized particles (30nm) via performance test reports. These models include the Neo Plus (CHP-264L), the AIS/My Ice (CHPI-7520L), and the Villaem II (CHP-18AR).
A Coway official said, “We rigorously verify and ensure the safety of our products against emerging harmful substances from various sources, so consumers can enjoy clean water without worries under any circumstances. Moving forward, we are committed to advancing filter technology and giving our customers even more confidence in our water purifiers.”
[1]Microplastic performance claims are based on the NSF/ANSI 42 Class 1 Particulate, 0.5~1um, protocol as a surrogate test. The systems that comply with the NSF/ANSI 42 Class 1 conform to NSF/ANSI 401 for reducing microplastics. [2]Coway’s exclusive performance testing methodology for water purifiers was approved and adopted as a test protocol by Intertek for evaluating and certifying microplastic removal efficacy.

Putin Sends Russia's Top Spy to North Korea,"The Kremlin dispatched Russia's spy chief to Pyongyang this week for talks with his North Korean counterpart, according to a rare state media disclosure, in a sign of deepening ties between the Cold War allies.
Sergei Naryshkin, who heads Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, held talks with North Korea's State Security Minister Ri Chang Dae from March 25-27, the official Korean Central News Agency said on Thursday.
The pair briefed each other ""on the present international and regional situation,"" the KCNA said, ""and widely and deeply discussed practical issues for further boosting cooperation to cope with the ever-growing spying and plotting moves by the hostile forces.""
It happened alongside working-level talks between intelligence officials from both sides, according to the report, which said the meetings ""proceeded in a comradely and amicable atmosphere.""
Naryshkin is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, having previously served as Kremlin chief of staff before becoming the speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house. He has been director of the external security service since 2016.
Foreign trips undertaken by senior intelligence officials typically are not publicized in real time unless for signaling purposes.
The Russian Foreign Ministry and North Korea's Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to separate written requests for comment.

Strategic ties between Moscow and Pyongyang go right back to the early days of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union became the first to formally recognize the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948, later backing the North militarily during the Korean War.
Both Russia and North Korea remain heavily sanctioned, the former for its war in Ukraine; the latter for its nuclear and missile programs.
The United States and its allies have accused North Korea of supplying ballistic missiles and thousands of rounds of artillery to Russia for use against Ukraine's forces—both governments deny the charge.
In exchange, South Korea's intelligence suggests, the Kremlin has made good on its promise to assist the North's reconnaissance satellite program and upgrade Pyongyang's Soviet-era military hardware.
Senior U.S. officials said they were ""deeply concerned"" by Putin's growing relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who was invited to tour Russia's main spaceport last fall. Kim recently received a Russia-made limousine as a personal gift from Putin.
Beijing, which historically competed with Moscow for influence in Pyongyang, will be watching how far the strategic ties go.

Coercion tactics on ice as tariffs lifted,"China has done this many times before, but Australia is being lauded as an example in other sanction-hit countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan of how to stand up to Beijing’s bullying.
In South Korea, for example, there is a huge amount of interest from government officials there in how the coercion campaign played out in Australia.
Three years later and Beijing has rolled back most of the restrictions, which left the Australian economy broadly unscathed.
The tariffs certainly hurt many individual Australian exporters and companies, so it would be incorrect to say it was painless. But many exporters found markets elsewhere for their products, while Australia’s overall trade with China has increased in the past three years.
China also further damaged its own reputation by seeking to bully Australia.
Xi is now scrambling to restore investor business confidence in China at a time when its economic growth is slowing as it battles a property crisis, weak consumer confidence and high debt.

This week, he met a group of 20 business leaders from the United States in Beijing where he told them China’s economic prospects remained bright.
Australian executives, including Fortescue’s Andrew Forrest are also in China this week for the Boao Forum for Asia.
While they will hail the abolition of the wine tariffs as a return to the pre-pandemic glory days of doing business with China, the reality is few Australian exporters trust Beijing anymore and the Chinese economy is slowing down anyway. China remains a critical market given its size, but wine exporters do not expect sales to return to the $1.2 billion highs of 2019.
China and Australia appear to be friends again, at least on an economic level. But that could change on a dime.
Even outside anti-dumping probes, Beijing has many other levers to pull such as unofficially ramping up customs inspections.
The Albanese government gets some credit for getting China to back down on wine, although it had to drop its case with the World Trade Organisation to do so which worked in Beijing’s favour.
But China might have done so regardless of who is in power given its weakening economy which means it has less leverage to annoy key trading partners and send the wrong signal to foreign investors right now.",2024-03-28T08:51:18Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review

Commentary: U.S.-led chip alliance could be OPEC-style cartel for digital age,"The U.S., Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are on a mission to restructure the global chip supply chain. The proposed “Chip 4 Alliance” wants to internalize all parts of the semiconductor business—research and development, design, manufacturing, packaging, sales and consumption—in-house. This chip clique will only reach outside the circle in strictly controlled circumstances.
These four economies constitute almost the entire global semiconductor industry, accounting for 82% of the global market share, and 74% of the semiconductor global value chain with 84% of chip design. They collectively occupy a 77% share in the market for manufacturing equipment and as high as 99% for memory chips. Thus, the Alliance is more than just cooperation and coordination: What these four governments determine will shape the global market.
But the Chip 4 Alliance raises a critical and complicated question: Can countries control production and manage trade for a product defined by innovation and competition?
If they can, we’re looking at something very new: an OPEC-style cartel for the digital age.
To the extent that participating members in the Chip 4 Alliance promise to regulate their respective domestic semiconductor industries in a coordinated way, and orient their businesses in a certain direction, this endeavor may introduce something akin to a state-owned enterprise, operated collectively and managed multinationally.
Put bluntly, the four Alliance members can lay out, in the long run, which companies do what, who produces parts and materials, how they are sourced, and where chips are distributed and sold. They will also align their R&D, financial support, and incentives. The chip sector will feature government-arranged financial support, on-going governmental influence, public-private joint business planning, and public mandate fulfilment.
This is none other than a well-known recipe for SOEs, a topic which took center stage in recent trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) or the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Economists have long argued that enterprises under the direction or indirect control of the government sap economic efficiency and hamper market competition.
It’s thus ironic that a new scheme for the global semiconductor industry could create a new type of SOE: the “multinational SOE,” distinct from the national SOEs targeted by by recent regulations and investment agreements.
If key decisions of the semiconductor businesses of the four members are made at the request (if not direction) of respective government agencies, those businesses are presumably set to be a new breed of state enterprise for the digital age.
What’s more, if their business decisions are coordinated and orchestrated by the pool of governments—whether an alliance, network or any other title—they will be virtually under the collective control of the participating governments.
Consider, for example, TSMC’s decision to build fabs in Phoenix, Arizona and Kumamoto, Japan, or Samsung’s new fab in Taylor, Texas. These locations don’t offer the same benefits as TSMC’s home of Taiwan, or Samsung’s home of Korea: less expertise, higher costs and more troublesome regulations. Why, then, did these chip giants decide to invest in the U.S. and Japan? Geopolitics is one obvious possibility.
Granted, the Chinese chip industry has also received a massive amount of financial support from both central and local governments. Beijing raised a semiconductor fund in the amount of $19 billion in 2014 and $27 billion in 2019, respectively. It is now planning to raise a new fund of $41 billion. Clearly a number of Chinese chipmakers can be called SOEs.
Yet endeavors like the Chip 4 Alliance risk creating a behemoth to fight a behemoth. One side may win against the other—then may wither because of stifled innovation and competition.
For chip companies, this whole plan is a Catch-22. In the course of restructuring the global supply chain, chipmakers are encouraged, if not forced, to discuss coordinating business activities with their counterparts. This line of close consultation reveals the Achilles’ heel of global corporations: the web of competition rules and antitrust sanctions in various states.
Members of the Chip 4 Alliance might downplay their competition rules, but non-participating governments, like the European Union, China, or others, might think otherwise when they feel short-changed from a new supply chain.
Semiconductors are just the most high-profile area where countries are using friendshoring to shift away from “countries of concern.” Yet if these policies become the norm, then the global system could end up with much less competition and much less innovation—dominated by a new breed of state-owned enterprise.

U.S. adds new sanctions targeting North Korea's weapons program,"The United States imposed new sanctions on six North Korean individuals and two entities with financial ties to the North's illicit weapons program, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. File Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, March 28 (UPI) -- The United States imposed new sanctions on six North Korean individuals and two entities that generate revenue and facilitate financial transactions for the authoritarian regime's illicit weapons program, the Treasury Department announced. The action targets agents of North Korean banks as well as companies that employ North Korean IT workers abroad, the department said in a statement Wednesday. Advertisement
""These actors, operating primarily through networks located in Russia and China, orchestrate schemes, set up front or shell companies and manage surreptitious bank accounts to move and disguise illicit funds, evade sanctions and finance the DPRK's unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs,"" the statement said.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
Among the sanctioned individuals are Yu Pu Ung and Ri Tong Hyok, both China-based representatives of Tanchon Bank. The bank is the financial arm of the Korea Mining Development Corporation, which is the North's ""premiere arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons,"" according to the department.

Russia-based O In Chun, a representative of Korea Daesong Bank, was also sanctioned. The bank is operated by the North's Office 39, which engages in illicit economic activities, manages slush funds and generates revenue for the regime, the department said.
The other sanctioned individuals are China-based Han Chol Man of Kumgang Bank, Russia-based Jong Song Ho of Jinmyong Joint Bank and Jon Yon Gun, who is connected to a newly designated United Arab Emirates real estate company.
The two entities designated Wednesday are Vladivostok-based Limited Liability Company Alis and the UAE's Pioneer Bencont Star Real Estate. Both firms are subordinate to IT firm Chinyong, which manages delegations of North Korean IT workers illegally operating in Russia and Laos.
South Korea also sanctioned four of the individuals and the two entities, its Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
""Today's joint action reflects our commitment to disrupt the DPRK's efforts to generate revenue for its illicit and destabilizing activities,"" Brian Nelson, under secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said. ""The United States, along with our South Korean partners, will continue to take action to safeguard the international financial system and prevent the DPRK from funding its illegal weapons programs.""

The new sanctions come amid growing evidence that North Korea has been able to evade a U.N. Security Council resolution that restricts its oil imports, thanks in large part to its growing relationship with Russia.
Seoul and Washington launched a new task force on Tuesday meant to counter the North's oil smuggling operations, which have increased as part of a weapons deal between Pyongyang and Moscow.
The designations also coincided with a meeting of the U.S.-South Korea Working Group on DPRK Cyber Threats this week, U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.
The group aims to ""disrupt the North's ability to generate revenue for its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs through cyber-enabled activities,"" Miller said.
Pyongyang funds 40% of its WMD program through ""illicit cybermeans,"" the U.N. Security Council's Panel of Experts estimated in its annual report released this month. The Panel said that 58 suspected cyberattacks on cryptocurrency-related companies generated some $3 billion for the regime between 2017 and 2023.",2024-03-28T03:45:38Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

Russia ‘abolishes’ monitoring of sanctions on North Korea with UN veto,"Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Thursday effectively abolishing the monitoring of sanctions against North Korea by UN experts.
Russia’s vote sparked Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its weapons purchases from North Korea for use in its war against Ukraine, in violation of sanctions.
Advertisement
The vote in the 15-member council was 13 in favour, Russia against, and China abstaining.
The Security Council resolution sponsored by the United States would have extended the mandate of the panel for a year, but Russia’s veto will halt its operations.
The resolution does not alter the sanctions, which remain in force.
Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the council before the vote that Western nations are trying to “strangle” North Korea and sanctions have proven “irrelevant” and “detached from reality” in reining in its nuclear programme.

US deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the council that Russia’s veto was nothing more than “the attempt by one council member to silence the independent objective investigations” into North Korea’s sanctions violations.
He said Russia acted because “the panel began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the UN Security Council resolutions”.
He warned that Russia’s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardising global security through development “of long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts”.
White House national security spokesman John Kirby condemned Russia’s veto as a “reckless action” that undermines sanctions imposed on North Korea, while warning against the deepening co-operation between North Korea and Russia, particularly as North Korea continues to supply Russia with weapons as it wages its war in Ukraine.

“The international community should resolutely uphold the global non-proliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression,” Mr Kirby told reporters.
Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of UN sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year”.

“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” she said.
“It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.

“This panel, through its word to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,” Ms Woodward said.

France’s UN ambassador Nicolas de Riviere added that “North Korea has been providing Russia with military material in support of its aggression against Ukraine, in violation of many resolutions which Russia voted in favour of”.

The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017.
China and Russia vetoed a US-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches.
The Security Council established a committee to monitor sanctions and the mandate for its panel of experts to investigate violations had been renewed for 14 years.",2024-03-28T00:00:00Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie,BreakingNews.ie
Hyundai Motor doubles down on EVs as it ramps up investment in Korea,"Open this photo in gallery: People walk through the Hyundai booth at the New York International Auto Show on March 27, in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty Images
Hyundai Motor Group said on Wednesday it will invest 68 trillion won (US$51 billion) over three years in South Korea to ramp up electric vehicle production and new mobility business and separately hire 80,000 new employees, doubling down at a time when other established auto makers are slowing efforts.
More than half of the investment, or 35.5 trillion won, will be allocated for new research and development infrastructure and assembly lines for EVs, the auto maker said in a statement.
“We are doubling down on electrification,” Hyundai global Chief Operating Officer Jose Munoz said in an interview at the New York auto show. “We’re very committed to the United States market.”
In the U.S., Hyundai said in November it was investing $12.6 billion for new dedicated EV and battery manufacturing facilities in Georgia – the largest investment outside South Korea.
Hyundai Motor Group includes flagship Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia, which together are the world’s number three auto maker by sales. Auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis and Hyundai Engineering & Construction are also under the conglomerate.
Hyundai’s new round of EV investment comes as rival auto makers are slowing plans to expand EV production, and shifting capital to hybrid models or bigger share buybacks and dividends for investors.
In 2021, General Motors said it planned to spend more than $35 billion on EV projects through 2025, and would prioritize accelerating EVs over near term profits. But last year, the U.S. auto maker delayed a planned electric truck factory and slashed its projected EV output.
GM last year said it would spend $10 billion to buy back shares, and CEO Mary Barra has indicated there could be more buybacks. Stellantis has also promised to return more cash to shareholders rather than increase investments in EVs.
Ford, which three years ago outlined $30 billion in EV spending through 2030, has since slashed production plans for its F-150 Lightning electric truck and shifted workers to build more gasoline-powered Bronco SUVs. Ford is now “right-sizing the capacity and investments we are putting into EVs,” Chief Financial Officer
John Lawler said Tuesday
.
Toyota, the world’s largest auto maker by vehicle sales, is adding more EVs to its lineup, but the Japanese auto maker has put more emphasis on increasing sales of gas-electric hybrids. Investors have cheered that choice, sending Toyota shares up nearly 50% so far this year.
Munoz said Hyundai also sees a slowdown in the pace of electrification, but added the Korean auto maker will maintain its plans but remain flexible, including the rollout of plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Hyundai on Wednesday showed off its 2025 Tucson SUV and will launch both hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions this summer.
“The only difference is we still see EVs in the long run as the way we are going to see the biggest growth,” he said.
Hyundai expects to begin producing EVs in Georgia in October to allow them to qualify for $7,500 tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act – ahead of its initial schedule, Munoz said. Hyundai, which saw U.S. EV sales double last year, will soon announce what EVs it will build in Georgia, he added.
Among the projects encompassed in the new investment plan announced Wednesday are the overhaul of a Kia factory for production of a compact EV that will be “produced and sold domestically and internationally.”
In 2025, a second factory will start producing “PBV” vehicles – a reference to a purpose-built EV. Hyundai showed prototypes of PBVs used as commercial vehicles at this years CES show in Las Vegas.
Hyundai’s Ulsan factory will begin mass producing “ultra-large” Genesis luxury EVs in the first quarter of 2026, the company said.
Hyundai said in South Korea another 31.1 trillion won will be slated for research and development in electric vehicles, including software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and battery technology, and most jobs created will be to promote future business.",2024-03-27T20:54:08Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail
North Korean TV censors blur out pants of British gardening show host,"Jack Guy and Yoonjung Seo, CNN
North Korea’s state broadcaster, KCTV, has blurred out a pair of jeans worn by veteran British TV host Alan Titchmarsh as part of the country’s censorship of foreign fashion and culture.
KCTV carried an episode of Titchmarsh’s show “Garden Secrets,” originally aired on the BBC in 2010, on Monday.
At one point he can be seen kneeling in a flowerbed, and keen-eyed viewers will notice that the lower half of his body has been blurred to obscure the jeans he is wearing.
Titchmarsh told the BBC that the censorship had given him some “street cred.”
“I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist - I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it’s given me a bit of street cred really hasn’t it?” he said.
Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul, told CNN that the censorship shows North Korea is strictly implementing the newly adopted Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act.
“The act aims to prohibit North Korean residents from imitating foreign countries in various aspects, including how they’re dressed and speak,” he said.
He added that jeans have been banned for residents as a symbol of American imperialism, but some flexibility has been applied to foreign visitors because they can’t prevent them from wearing jeans.
Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said the censorship is part of a fight against “anti-socialist culture and ideology.”
“Blue jeans are associated with ‘decadent’ Western culture, as they were in the Soviet Union, and Kim Jong Il ordered officials to rid the country of them back in the 1990s,” he said.
“They have had campaigns against anti-socialist culture since at least the early 1990s,” said Ward. “The intensity of these campaigns has increased, especially since 2020.”
The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act was introduced that year, banning the population from distributing, watching or listening to any cultural content deemed to be anti-socialist.
Violations are punishable by years of hard labor for small quantities of banned material and even death for larger amounts.
At that time, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that the law prevents “the introduction and dissemination of anti-socialist ideology and culture….so that North Koreans can protect their own ideology, spirit, and culture.”
For decades, North Korea has been comparatively closed off from the rest of the world, with tight restrictions on free expression, free movement and access to information.
Its dismal human rights record has been criticized by the United Nations. Internet use is heavily restricted; even the privileged few who are allowed smartphones can only access a government-run, heavily censored intranet.
Foreign materials like books and movies are banned, often with severe punishments for those caught with black market contraband.",2024-03-27T19:58:48Z,https://www.cp24.com,CP24 Toronto

"FTSE Holds Off Adding South Korea, India to Key Bond Indexes","(Bloomberg) -- FTSE Russell said South Korea will continue to stay on the watch list for inclusion to its global bond index — and India for the emerging-market equivalent — once more delaying the countries’ addition to the key indexes by at least another six months.
The index provider “will continue to monitor the positive developments in the South Korean government bond market towards the successful fulfillment"" of the criteria, FTSE said in a statement on Wednesday.
It also acknowledged progress in “the accessibility of the Indian government bond market,"" but said the Indian market still doesn’t satisfy certain criteria.
South Korea has been keen to get the index upgrade since FTSE added the country to its watch list for potential inclusion in September 2022. The move is expected to draw as much as 90 trillion won ($66.7 billion), according to the Korean government, citing estimates from investment banks.
Korean authorities have been intensifying efforts to improve the country’s market systems to court more foreign investors, most recently letting some global investors participate in the local interbank currency market. The government is also testing out extended trading hours of the local won market, ahead of its official extension due in July.
Meanwhile, India still doesn’t meet criteria including increased regulatory reporting and the tax clearance process, FTSE said. Both countries were not included on the indexes when they were last last reviewed in September, 2023.

FTSE Russell’s decision highlights the hurdles some investors continue to face in accessing India’s bond market, even as the nation’s debt is set to get added to JPMorgan’s flagship emerging markets gauge starting in June. Others have been piling in though, with inflows to the nation’s bonds helping make it one of the top performers in local currency emerging market debt this year.
Vietnam, Pakistan
On the equities side, FTSE Russell said it will keep Vietnam’s status as a frontier market unchanged. While it highlighted the country’s “resolute"" drive, the index provider said it needs to see more improvements in access to the local equity market and issues around settlement of trades.

The country was added to the watch list in September 2018 for possible reclassification to secondary emerging markets, but the index compiler had said its progress has been slower than anticipated, in part due to Covid. A pre-funding requirement is the key hurdle to an upgrade, investors say.
The index compiler also retained Pakistan on the watch list for potential demotion to frontier market status from secondary emerging market amid a steady decline in its index weight over the past few years.

"Ostrich escapes zoo in South Korea, runs through traffic","Subscribe | UPI Odd Newsletter Subscribe
March 27 (UPI) -- An ostrich escaped from a zoo in South Korea and was caught on camera running through traffic on a busy road before being recaptured.
The male ostrich, named Tadori, escaped from a zoo called Bug City in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, and was seen running through busy roads before being cornered and safely recaptured in the parking lot of a storage building.

The zoo's owner said Tadori squeezed through a narrow gap between fences at the facility. The owner said the ostrich has been displaying signs of loneliness and anxiety since his mate, Tasuni, died a month earlier.
Tadori and Tasuni arrived at Bug City when they where chicks in July 2020.

US and Ally Move To Block North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program,"The U.S. and South Korea have kicked off a task force aiming to stem the flow of resources that could aid North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile programs.
The bilateral Enhanced Disruption Task Force (EDTF) held its first meeting on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., marking the beginning of its bid to counter North Korean efforts to bypass sanctions, the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
The EDTF was created amid concerns over Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost his nuclear arsenal.
Last year, the North Korean leader called for the regime to ramp up production of warheads, defying the United Nations Security Council's wide-ranging sanctions. In a report published Wednesday, North Korea-focused analysis group NK Pro featured satellite imagery showing new construction at a suspected nuclear complex.
The inaugural EDTF meeting saw the participation of more than 30 officials ranging in expertise from intelligence and diplomacy to maritime interdiction and sanctions, Yonhap News cited South Korea's foreign ministry as saying.
Attendees stressed the importance of cooperation on cracking down on the country's ability to obtain petroleum, including from Russia, that fuels North Korea's weapons programs and overall military readiness.
Also discussed were methods of countering North Korean efforts to import refined petroleum in excess of the 500,000 barrel annual cap set by the United Nations Security Council.
North Korean tankers were estimated to have smuggled up to three times that amount between January and September 15 of last year, according to U.N. experts.

Companies and persons who play a part in smuggling this resource into the reclusive country should be punished with independent sanctions, task force members agreed, per Yonhap News.
EDTF will explore a variety of methods of disrupting Pyongyang's oil procurement channels.
These include exposing its ""sanctions evasion activities, reviewing options for autonomous sanctions designations, and engaging private sector and third-party actors throughout the region who facilitate—either knowingly or unwittingly—the DPRK's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) oil procurement networks,"" the State Department said, using North Korea's official name.
The North Korean embassy in China did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
The new analysis of satellite imagery showed workers have been building an annex along an alleged uranium enrichment site near Pyongyang. NK Pro pointed out the structure is similar in size to facilities construct to house centrifuges at the Yongbyon nuclear plant in 2013 and 2021.
In September, Kim gave the order to ""exponentially increase nuclear weapons production to realize all kinds of nuclear strike methods and deploy them to various military branches."" Meanwhile, the regime continues to test rockets, including those it says can be fitted with nuclear warheads.",2024-03-27T12:34:43Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
US Ally Scrambles Jets To Intercept Chinese Spy Drone,"The Japanese Defense Ministry said it scrambled fighter jets on Tuesday to intercept a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle in the Sea of Japan, in what was the first known operation in the area by China's long-range spy drone.
A Newsweek map, recreated using data released by the Joint Staff of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, shows the flight path of the WZ-7 reconnaissance UAV, which Tokyo said was detected in the waters on the morning of March 26.
The Chinese military drone entered the Sea of Japan—known in both Koreas as the East Sea—via the continental area and later returned in a northwesterly direction following a circular patrol, the report said, suggesting the sortie most likely overflew the territory of North Korea or Russia, which both border the sea.
Japan said it scrambled unspecified fighter aircraft to monitor the UAV, which did not violate Japanese airspace. Air Self-Defense Force jets were also dispatched to head off other possible airspace violations in the East China Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, the Joint Staff said.
The Japanese Defense Ministry said it would ""continue to pay close attention to military movements and maintain the utmost vigilance,"" according to the Kyodo news agency.
China's Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to multiple written request for comment.

Little is know about the WZ-7 Soaring Dragon, which is built by the state-owned drone maker Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corp. and first unveiled in 2021 at the Zhuhai air show in southern China, where it was also displayed the following year.
The UAV's silhouette is identifiable by its unique joined-wing design—visible in the photo captured by Japan's pilots.

Analysts describe the WZ-7 as China's answer to the U.S. Air Force's RQ-4 Global Hawk, a high-altitude, long-endurance reconnaissance drone built by Northrop Grumman. However, the extent of the Chinese aircraft's capabilities remain unclear.
""The primary mission is expected to be aerial reconnaissance, but it may also be fitted to provide targeting data for anti-ship ballistic missiles and cruise missiles,"" the U.S. Army's ODIN military database says.
Available research states both the Chinese air force and navy operate a handful of the turbojet-powered UAV, which has been seen at China's disputed Himalayan border with India as well as in Taiwan's air defense zone.
A 2018 report by the investigative outfit Bellingcat said China had stationed WZ-7 drones at the Yishuntun air base in northeastern Jilin province, on the border with North Korea.
In January 2023, Japanese radars detected a WZ-7 flying a sortie from the East China Sea into the Western Pacific via the strategic Miyako Strait, the drone's first publicly reported foray beyond the so-called first island chain.

The Kareliya is in service with Russia's Pacific Fleet, headquartered in the Peter the Great Gulf in the Sea of Japan. The same vessel was monitored by the U.S. Coast Guard after appearing off the Hawaiian islands early last year.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
Of particular concern is the growing relationship between Russia and North Korea, which officials say has led to an exchange of weapons for oil.
The allies ""underscored the need for close collaboration to disrupt the DPRK's ability to illicitly procure excess petroleum, including petroleum from Russia, as this activity directly contributes to the DPRK's military readiness and the development of its weapons programs,"" the State Department said.

The task force meeting included more than 30 officials from ministries and agencies covering diplomacy, intelligence, sanctions and maritime interdiction, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement.
""Oil is an essential resource for North Korea's nuclear and missile development and military posture,"" the ministry said.
A U.N. Security Council resolution passed in 2017 limits the amount of refined petroleum that North Korea can import to 500,000 barrels per year.
However, Pyongyang has long used illicit means to skirt the restrictions. The Security Council's Panel of Experts estimated in its annual report released last week that North Korea imported more than 1.5 million barrels of refined oil from January to September last year.
North Korea, meanwhile, has shipped around 7,000 containers of munitions to Russia since July for use in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said last week.
Shin estimated that Russia has sent more than 9,000 containers back to North Korea in return, carrying food, as well as raw materials used for producing munitions. He also suggested that Russia was providing North Korea with fuel, noting a significant uptick in military exercises since the start of the year.
An analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday by British think tank Royal United Services Institute and the Financial Times shows further evidence of a fuel exchange, with at least five North Korean tankers traveling to collect oil products from Vostochny Port in Russia's Far East in March.

The tankers could have moved up to 125,000 barrels of refined petroleum products -- a quarter of the U.N.'s annual oil cap -- in less than three weeks, the RUSI analysis said.
The U.N.'s Panel of Experts, which monitors North Korean sanctions, is also facing an uncertain future due to resistance from Security Council members Russia and China. A vote to extend its mandate was scheduled to be held last Friday but had to be postponed due to ""long, difficult, and contentious"" negotiations instigated by Moscow and Beijing, who are pushing for sunset clauses in the sanctions regime, according to the independent think tank Security Council Report.",2024-03-27T09:57:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
"New history, old traditions","Around The Web
What’s old is new in the hands of Kim Young-Jin. The fashion designer is famous for her exquisite hanbok, a traditional form of Korean clothing that has existed for centuries. But Kim has made hanbok her own, respecting the history of the iconic attire while boldly adapting it for a new era. Kim invites us into her Seoul, South Korea, studio to learn more about her approach to design.
Hippos are massive animals that live in Africa. They are the third largest land mammals on earth. Only elephants and white rhinos are larger. They can reach an incredible 4.9m (16 feet) in length and a mass of 1500kg (3,300lb). Due to their aggression and their size, adult hippos are rarely preyed upon. Young hippos are occasionally taken by lions or crocodiles. Surprisingly, the hippo's closest relatives are whales and dolphins. Aquatic mammals like whales evolved from land animals that were very similar to the hippo. Originally, it was believed that hippos were closely related to pigs due to molar structure and other similarities, but DNA and fossil records have c hanged this line of thinking in the past century.
Hippos are most active at night, roaming the shallows along riverbeds in Africa. They are herbivores, eating aquatic vegetation, and occasionally farm crops, which contributes to conflict with humans. Known to be aggressive, even when not provoked, hippos will occasionally charge humans or boats.
The hippo produces a red oil, as can be seen on these sunbathing adults, which acts as a sunblock, protecting them from UV rays.

North Korean TV censors British gardening show host’s jeans,"CNN —
North Korea’s state broadcaster, KCTV, has blurred out a pair of jeans worn by veteran British TV host Alan Titchmarsh as part of the country’s censorship of foreign fashion and culture.
KCTV carried an episode of Titchmarsh’s show “Garden Secrets,” originally aired on the BBC in 2010, on Monday.
At one point he can be seen kneeling in a flowerbed, and keen-eyed viewers will notice that the lower half of his body has been blurred to obscure the jeans he is wearing.
Titchmarsh told the BBC that the censorship had given him some “street cred.”
Titchmarsh, pictured during the KCTV broadcast BBC/KCTV
“I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist - I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it’s given me a bit of street cred really hasn’t it?” he said.
Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul, told CNN that the censorship shows North Korea is strictly implementing the newly adopted Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act.
“The act aims to prohibit North Korean residents from imitating foreign countries in various aspects, including how they’re dressed and speak,” he said.
He added that jeans have been banned for residents as a symbol of American imperialism, but some flexibility has been applied to foreign visitors because they can’t prevent them from wearing jeans.
Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said the censorship is part of a fight against “anti-socialist culture and ideology.”
“Blue jeans are associated with ‘decadent’ Western culture, as they were in the Soviet Union, and Kim Jong Il ordered officials to rid the country of them back in the 1990s,” he said.
“They have had campaigns against anti-socialist culture since at least the early 1990s,” said Ward. “The intensity of these campaigns has increased, especially since 2020.”
The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act was introduced that year, banning the population from distributing, watching or listening to any cultural content deemed to be anti-socialist.
Violations are punishable by years of hard labor for small quantities of banned material and even death for larger amounts.
At that time, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that the law prevents “the introduction and dissemination of anti-socialist ideology and culture….so that North Koreans can protect their own ideology, spirit, and culture.”
For decades, North Korea has been comparatively closed off from the rest of the world, with tight restrictions on free expression, free movement and access to information.
Its dismal human rights record has been criticized by the United Nations. Internet use is heavily restricted; even the privileged few who are allowed smartphones can only access a government-run, heavily censored intranet.
Foreign materials like books and movies are banned, often with severe punishments for those caught with black market contraband.",2024-03-27T04:00:00Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network
Alan Titchmarsh's trousers censored on North Korean TV,"North Korea’s state TV channel has censored a BBC gardening show by blurring presenter Alan Titchmarsh’s jeans.
Korean Central Television (KCTV) aired a 2010 episode of Alan Titchmarsh’s Garden Secrets, where footage of the British broadcaster was obscured from the waist down as he knelt in a garden bed tending to plants.
Jeans are seen as a symbol of Western imperialism and are banned under the North Korean regime.
Titchmarsh told the BBC that the news had given him ""a bit of street cred"".
""It’s taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart.
""You know, wearing trousers that are generally considered by those of us of a sensitive disposition to be rather too tight.""
He said that his jeans were not too tight but were not acceptable in North Korea.
He added: ""I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist. I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually, it’s given me a bit of street cred, really, hasn’t it?""
Jeans have been prohibited since the 1990s when leader Kim Jong-il declared them to be a symbol of Western, and specifically US, imperialism, which had no place in a socialist state, according to Seoul-based outlet NK News.

"Atomic clocks to ensure one-nation, one time","NEW DELHI : India is deploying atomic clocks across the country to ensure the time shown on your digital watch, smartphone and laptop is truly based on Indian Standard Time—an effort launched more than two decades ago after the Kargil war.
Currently, most software operating modules in India rely on US-based Network Time Protocol servers. The government wants all software to instead be synchronised with indigenous atomic clocks, both for uniformity in time and as a defence mechanism, especially in times of war.
The atomic clocks are being installed by the consumer affairs ministry’s Legal Metrology Department and the National Physical Laboratory, or NPL—the nation’s timekeeper. So far, India has atomic clocks at Ahmedabad and Faridabad and more are being installed at Bhubaneswar, Jaipur and Hyderabad as well, according to three officials aware of the development.
“The installation and testing of all atomic clocks will be completed by the end of June,"" one of them said.
Once the exercise is completed, all computers, smartphones, digital watches, and digital radios will have Indian time managed by NPL and the consumer affairs ministry’s Regional Reference Standard Laboratories, ensuring “one nation, one time"", this person said.
The project was initiated after the Kargil war when India was denied information on the GPS location of Pakistani intruders, a second person said. “The importance of having our own time is significant, especially in areas like defence security, cybersecurity, and online transactions. Even a small time gap can be crucial in such situations.""
The consumer affairs ministry didn’t immediately reply to queries on the developments.
Only four other countries—the US, the UK, Japan, and Korea—have their own atomic clocks.
The government, through the consumer affairs ministry, is developing a legal framework to mandate that all software service providers across the country synchronise their time with the atomic clocks developed by the National Physical Laboratory, said the first person quoted above.
Failure to comply may result in severe penalties, including the cancellation of licences.
“Currently, accurate time-keeping is done through satellite… (the) consumer affairs ministry and NPL are working on a plan to connect all atomic clocks through optical cable as it will be more secure, given that satellite-based time dissemination is susceptible to potential blockage by enemy countries during wartime or emergencies,"" said Venu Gopal Achanta, director of CSIR-NPL.
The optical cable-laying work would be completed in about six months, he added.
“The Indian Space Research Organisation is utilising the NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) constellation for the dissemination of time across the country with an uncertainty of 20 nanoseconds,"" Achanta said. “With this, every corner of the country will have Indian Standard Time.""",2024-03-26T18:30:00Z,https://www.livemint.com,Livemint

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-26T18:10:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de
Investors eye South Korea and India as money exits China,"Cash flows south, too
And it’s not just the emerging markets that have benefited, with a wave of cash from China also piled into Australia’s sharemarket. This has fuelled a dazzling rally in the nation’s biggest banks and helped send the S & P/ASX 200 to a record earlier this month.
Hasan Tevfik, senior analyst at MST Marquee, told The Australian Financial Review earlier this month that a re-weighting out of China had benefited other markets in the region such as India and Australia.
Northcape Capital’s emerging markets portfolio manager Ross Cameron said the money pulled from China was also being reinvested in South Korea and Japan, which had helped push the Nikkei above 41,000 points for the first time in history.
Mr Cameron said one of the reasons for the influx of money was improvements in corporate behaviour with a “greater focus on return on equity and credit discipline” in both countries.
In particular, he pointed to South Korea’s government reforms to boost shareholder returns, as Seoul aims to replicate Japan’s success in boosting stock valuations with a corporate governance drive and tax incentives.

“The discount at a number of companies in South Korea are trading below book value – it’s even higher than Japan,” Mr Cameron said.
He said that the focus on shareholder returns enhanced the prospects for South Korean companies, which were among the world’s largest manufacturers of technology. Memory chipmakers such as Samsung Electronics and SK hynix were also very “positively exposed” to artificial intelligence, he added.

“These are mega AI plays … I think South Korea is the obvious beneficiary in the region,” he said.
Antipodes’ John Stavliotis, who oversees the firm’s emerging markets fund, has also turned more bullish on South Korea, saying the corporate governance reforms would be a “catalyst to realise value”.
He noted that around 70 per cent of stocks in South Korea were trading on less than one times book value because it had pretty low returns on equities. In other words, they’re trading cheaper than the value of the company’s underlying assets.

“It remains early days, but South Korea is a very cheap market with a lot of companies that have very rich cash balance sheets,” said Maple-Brown Abbott’s lead portfolio manager, Will Main.
He said South Korea was benefitting from China’s outflows and was set to benefit from the reforms, but a broader tax reform needed to be implemented.
“There’s still a bit of uncertainty but when we met with the Korean regulator; a couple of weeks ago they appeared committed to implementing this program,” he said.
India attracts cash
Beyond South Korea, Antipodes Mr Stavliotis said India’s sharemarket was by far the biggest beneficiary of China’s outflows.
Abrdn’s Asian equities investment manager Xin-Yao Ng also said he had been “dipping back” into the Indian sharemarket after a recent pullback.

MSCI India Index booked a 19.2 per cent rally last year and has continued to rise 4.7 per cent year-to-date.
“Though [we are] doing that cautiously and selectively because we think, in most parts within the smaller cap space, valuations still seem high even after the correction,” said Mr Ng, who is based in Singapore.
He remains cautious on China, even if he thinks valuations are cheap.
“There are some potential bargains while staying very selective,” Mr Ng said.
Antipodes’ Mr Stavliotis meanwhile said the market downturn in China presented an opportunity to buy quality businesses with heavily discounted valuations. He is overweight China in his portfolio.
“There are some green shoots at the moment with the PBOC balance sheet expanding, and improving Chinese consumption, but we’re kind of not banking on a near-term turnaround on the macro,” he said. “We’re positive because we think that this market isn’t a negative market.”",2024-03-26T18:00:00Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review
"US Ally Wants to Meet Kim Jong Un 'as Soon as Possible,' North Korea Says","Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio has expressed that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un ""as soon as possible,"" the North Korean leader's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, said Monday, according to state media.
But just a day after hinting that such a summit was possible—pending a ""decision"" by Japan—Kim changed course, saying Pyongyang would ""reject all contact and negotiations"" over Tokyo's continued concerns over abductees and the Kim regime's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Last month, the Financial Times reported that Kishida hoped for dialogue with Kim, the first of its kind in two decades, in a bid to boost his flagging domestic approval rating. A major focus of the meeting would be the status and possible release of the Japanese nationals North Korea kidnapped in the 1960s and 70s, the report said.
Kim Yo Jong, who is the vice department director of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee and has been tipped as her brother's possible successor, appeared to indicate last month that the regime was open to a bilateral talk provided Japan stops raising concerns over North Korea's ""legitimate right to self-defense"" and the ""already settled abduction issue.""

Japan, South Korea and the U.S. have frequently protested the North's ballistic missile tests and advancing nuclear weapons program.
Despite having signaled the reclusive country's conditional willingness to meet, Kim Yo Jong did an apparent about-face on Tuesday in a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency.
""Japan has no courage to change history, promote regional peace and stability and take the first step for the fresh DPRK-Japan relations, she said, referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""It was the Japanese side that knocked at the door first requesting 'the Japan-DPRK summit without preconditions' and the DPRK only clarified its stand that it would welcome Japan if it is ready to make a new start, not being obsessed by the past.""
Newsweek reached out to the North Korean Embassy in China and Prime Minister Kishida's office with written requests for comment.
In her statement on Monday, Kim Yo Jong said the Japanese prime minister had reached out about the potential summit through ""another channel"" than would typically be used.
She appeared to leave the door open to the summit but said the Japanese government had to make a ""political decision"" before bilateral ties could improve.
If Japan is considering interfering in North Korea's sovereignty, for instance with the ""abduction issue,"" then Kishida's outreach is ""little short of a bid for popularity"" and North Korea will view the country as an enemy rather than a friend, she said.
However, if the Japan ""respects the former's sovereignty and security interests"" on fair and equal footing, North Korea's ""strengthened self-defense capability will never be a threat to the security of Japan,"" she added.",2024-03-26T17:50:24Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek

Want all the best bits on the box? Share your email to get TV news, interviews, spoilers and more
Alan Titchmarsh's jeans were blurred out on North Korean television because they were seen as too 'Western'. The 74-year-old presenter's BBC show, Garden Secrets, is popular in North Korea, but his choice of trousers caused a stir.
Since the early nineties, jeans have been banned in the country because they're seen as a symbol of US imperialism. In the episode, which first aired in the UK in 2010, Alan was seen gardening while wearing a checked shirt and jeans.
While his shirt was deemed suitable for North Korean viewers, his jeans were not and were blurred out on screen, reports the Mirror. The episode about the 17th-century Hatfield House gardens has been shown several times since 2022.

According to NK News, former leader Kim Jong Il once told citizens that jeans are ""absolutely verboten and people should not wear them under any circumstances."" Kim Jong-un has warned about letting in ""bourgeois culture"" and ""anti-socialist behaviour"".
Alan showed astonishment once at his programme being broadcast in North Korea. He said: ""I never imagined that my programmes would reach North Korea, but hopefully the calming nature of British gardening will be well received there.""
Last year, news circulated that the current leader of North Korea had prohibited things such as skinny jeans, mullet hairstyles, and certain types of body piercings. This followed alerts that more efforts needed to be made to prevent ""capitalistic culture"" from influencing their nation.

A story was published by Rodong Sinmum, the official newspaper of the North Korean government, conveying worries over young people adopting Western styles.

North Korea Images Spark Nuclear Fears,"North Korea has again started work to expand a site believed to be a nuclear facility close to the country's capital city, according to new analysis, as the secretive nation's leadership becomes bolder in its nuclear rhetoric and tensions with its southern neighbor skyrocket.
A ""new annex"" is under construction at the Kangson site near Pyongyang, believed by some analysts to be a North Korean uranium enrichment site, according to NKPro, a project run by the U.S.-based NK News website.
The new area, which the outlet said was identified from satellite imagery, is just over a fifth of the size of the current main building, according to their analysis, adding it was built in the past month. Newsweek reached out to the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office in Geneva via email for comment.
The Kangson site was identified as a likely uranium enrichment compound in 2018. The Diplomat reported at the time that U.S. intelligence had been monitoring this site for more than 10 years.
But a report published by North Korean analysts with 38 North in late 2020 suggested Kangson may not be a uranium enrichment site, but a facility manufacturing parts centrifuges. Centrifuges, however, can be used to enrich uranium and then used as nuclear fuel.
NEW: North Korea expanding suspected uranium enrichment site, satellite imagery shows https://t.co/4c13yywWBd — NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) March 26, 2024
Satellite imagery previously suggested in 2021 that North Korea was expanding its uranium enrichment plant at the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Facility complex, north of Pyongyang. This could be laying the groundwork to ""increase production of nuclear materials for weapons production,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN in September 2021.
Recent months have seen Pyongyang and its leader, Kim Jong Un, become more daring in nuclear saber-rattling as relations with South Korea frayed to their worst point in decades.
North Korea has shifted from an official policy of reconciliation with South Korea, declaring Seoul to be a sworn enemy. South Korea and Japan have expressed grave concerns about North Korea's military activity, calling Pyongyang's actions a severe threat to their national security and turning to the U.S. for support—something that has angered North Korea.
North Korea has said it is upping weapons production and test-fired a host of new weapons capable of carrying nuclear weapons, from an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to an ""underwater nuclear weapons system"" supposedly capable of unleashing a nuclear tsunami on North Korea's adversaries. In September, North Korea said it had debuted its first ""tactical nuclear attack submarine"" able to carry and launch nuclear weapons.
There is some doubt among Western analysts about the submarine's true capabilities, but North Korea has also launched a spy satellite and committed to putting several more into orbit this year.

Genesis unveils its take on the big luxury EV-the Neolun Concept,"Genesis provided train tickets from Washington to New York and accommodation so Ars could attend its event. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.
NEW YORK—You can always rely on Genesis to bring at least one interesting concept to the New York International Auto Show. This year, the company brought several. At a busy reveal at the brand's Genesis House in Manhattan, it showed us its high-performance ambitions with not one but four bright orange machines, plus one rather famous Belgian racing driver. Then, in a chamber reminiscent of The Barmacide Feast, we got to see the poshest Genesis yet, the brand's take on a big luxury electric vehicle inspired by Korean hospitality.

Genesis was tight-lipped in the lead-up to Monday night's unveilings, but no one was entirely surprised to see a big electric SUV. Genesis is owned by Hyundai Group, after all, and has access to the E-GMP architecture, a thoroughly up-to-date flexible platform that keeps impressing us. Kia just used E-GMP to great effect to make the EV9, a three-row family SUV. And Hyundai's take on that form factor is due later this year in the production Ioniq 7, so an upmarket model from Genesis seemed obvious.

""The last eight years, it was about finding who we are and then discovering DNA for the Genesis,"" said SangYup Lee, global design head for Genesis. ""Now it's time to expand.""
It's a much cleaner design than I was expecting—between its smoothed edges and those monoblock wheels, you might get some Mercedes Maybach vibes. The proportions look right, though. ""We made it with an obsession to detail in every single dimension of the vehicle,"" Lee explained.
Genesis says it's learned enough about engineering the pillarless ""coach doors"" that ""its application to production vehicles is now feasible."" (These doors are commonly known ""suicide doors,"" a term the auto industry prefers to avoid using in marketing.) Running boards emerge out of the sides when the doors are open, then slide back to minimize drag once they close again. There are retractable roof rails as well.
The concept is strictly a four-seater, with front seats that can swivel through 180 degrees to face the rear. There's lots of purple leather and indigo-dyed cashmere and a dark wood floor to the cabin. Entertainment screens fold down from the roof for the rear passengers, and the interior is warmed by radiant heat via ""heating films applied to the dashboard, door trims, floor, seatbacks and console sides,"" Genesis said.
""Everybody challenges the technology, but at the end of it, how you execute it is more important,"" said Lee. ""Neolum gives another level of experience for customers. You will experience technology throughout all different five senses,"" he told us.
A production version hasn't been officially confirmed, but Lee said he expected Genesis to release a flagship SUV ""sooner than later.""",2024-03-26T16:07:53Z,https://arstechnica.com,Ars Technica
"Soccer-Iraq, Australia progress in World Cup qualifiers as South Korea win","Iraq and Australia ensured their progress to the third round of Asia's 2026 World Cup preliminaries on Tuesday with wins against the Philippines and Lebanon respectively, while South Korea edged closer with a 3-0 win over Thailand.
The Iraqis notched up their fourth victory in a row to advance as Jesus Casas' side handed the Philippines a 5-0 thumping in Manila. Aymen Hussein scored twice in the first half, either side of a goal from Amir Ali Ammari, while former Manchester United midfielder Zidane Iqbal and Zayed Tahseen were on target in the 61st and 77th minutes respectively.
The win moves Iraq onto 12 points in Group F, nine clear of third placed Vietnam, who suffered a damaging 3-0 loss in Hanoi against Indonesia. That result strengthens Indonesia's hopes of a place in the next round as Shin Tae-yong's team consolidate their hold on second place in the group ahead of the Vietnamese with two games remaining.
Jay Noah Idzes gave the visitors the lead in the ninth minute and further goals from Rangar Oratmangoen and Muhammad Sananta sealed a key success for the South East Asians. The top two finishers in each of the nine groups advance to the next round of qualifying, which will see 18 teams battle for Asia's eight guaranteed berths at the first-ever 48-team World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States in 2026.
Craig Goodwin scored twice as Australia also progressed in a 5-0 win over Lebanon in Canberra that confirmed the Socceroos would advance from Group I with maximum points from four games. Palestine, meanwhile, sit in second place with seven points after securing a 1-0 victory over Bangladesh.
Michel Termanini scored two minutes after Amid Mahajna's 92nd minute sending off for a second yellow card to move the Palestinians five points ahead of third-placed Lebanon. The South Koreans, meanwhile, put Thursday's disappointing draw with Thailand in Seoul behind them in the return clash in Bangkok with Lee Jae-sung, Son Heung-min and Park Jin-seop netting in a 3-0 win in Group C.
Lee bundled his effort over the goal line in the 19th minute following Cho Gue-sung's centre and Son doubled the lead nine minutes after the interval from Lee Kang-in's incisive pass. Park completed the win eight minutes from time with a close-range volley after Kim Min-jae had headed Kim Jin-su's cross into his path.
China moved into second in the group with a 4-1 win against Singapore, with Wu Lei scoring twice to take Branko Ivankovic's side onto seven points from four games, three ahead of the third-placed Thais.

"North Korea trying to excite Japan with leaders’ summit, but Kishida faces difficult choices","TOKYO – North Korea has been tempting Japan with the prospect of a visit to Pyongyang by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for the first leaders’ summit in 20 years – but with a massive catch.
Tokyo must accept Pyongyang’s weapons programme and treat its abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s as a resolved issue for such a summit to be held, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) cited leader Kim Jong Un’s influential sister Kim Yo Jong as saying on March 25.
Mr Kishida has said he is open to meeting Mr Kim with no preconditions. But Ms Kim rubbished the idea of any summit unless Tokyo first agrees to terms that it has long considered non-negotiable.
Implying that a summit cannot be a mere photo op to boost Mr Kishida’s awful domestic support, she was quoted as saying: “Just because the Prime Minister wants to, does not mean he can meet our country’s leadership.”
In a separate development that goes against the grain of tentatively warmer ties, North Korea suddenly scrapped a World Cup qualifier against Japan that was to have been played at Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Stadium on March 26. Japan won the reverse tie in Tokyo 1-0 on March 21.
Mr Kishida’s approval ratings at home are languishing, and critics believe an unlikely meeting with Mr Kim would allow him to portray himself as a consummate diplomat.
This could give him a quick boost in support, as time is running out before a ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership contest that will be called in September 2024.
Observers said the Prime Minister faces difficult choices: He may give an inch, but sentiment will turn even further against him if Mr Kim ends up taking a mile.
“The big question is whether Kishida has the strong determination and conviction to assert that – despite all the concerns and risks – it was important to advance the relationship between Japan and North Korea at this point,” Professor Atsuhito Isozaki, an expert on North Korea issues at Japan’s Keio University, told The Straits Times.
A senior government official told the Asahi newspaper that North Korea was trying to excite Japan, adding: “We should be careful not to overreact, or else we would play into their hands.”
Nothing in public statements by either side suggests the needle has shifted from their respective entrenched positions.
Japan regards North Korea – with which it has neither normalised relations nor made reparations for World War II – as a pariah state, even as leaders since the late Mr Shinzo Abe have said they were open to a summit without preconditions.
In January, Mr Kim extended a surprise olive branch to Mr Kishida in a historic condolence message after a 7.6-magnitude New Year’s Day earthquake struck the Noto Peninsula, even referring to the premier as “Your Excellency”.
On March 25, Ms Kim divulged that Mr Kishida had recently made approaches “through another channel” other than the usual diplomatic routes to convey his hopes of meeting Mr Kim “as soon as possible”.
This prompted a rare acknowledgement from Tokyo that it has been lobbying for a summit through “various routes”. Even then, top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed that it was “totally unacceptable” for Tokyo to accept Pyongyang’s word that the abduction issue has been resolved.
Mr Kishida, meanwhile, told reporters: “Nothing has been decided so far on whether a summit will be realised.”
As it stands, both countries hold intractably divergent views.
Tokyo demands that Pyongyang commits to achieving complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation and a resolution of the abduction issue before it will normalise ties and mete out wartime reparations.
Pyongyang, however, says its ballistic missile and nuclear programme is necessary for self-defence and insists the abduction issue has long been resolved.
Pyongyang admitted in 2002 that its agents had kidnapped Japanese citizens between the 1970s and 1980s to teach the Japanese language and culture to North Korea’s spies. Their identities were also stolen and used by agents for espionage.
While there are hundreds of suspected victims, Japan formally recognises 17 abductees. But North Korea maintains there were 13 abductees, with the other four having never entered the country.
Five were returned in 2002 after the historic first summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who offered Tokyo a formal apology.
This was followed by a second summit two years later, when family members including the North Korean-born children of the five returnees were brought to Japan.
Pyongyang insists the others are dead and says the matter has long been resolved.
Mr Takuya Yokota, 55, the brother of high-profile abductee Megumi who was snatched from Niigata in 1977 when she was 13, leads a support group for the families of other abductees. He said: “We cannot compromise on our demand that all abductees be immediately returned to Japan.”
Additionally, the geopolitical situation has drastically changed since Mr Kim met then South Korean President Moon Jae-in and then United States President Donald Trump in a flurry of summits from 2018 to 2019. This may have affected the diplomatic calculus.
South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol and his US counterpart Joe Biden, however, are antipathetic towards Pyongyang.
Mr Kim has stepped up North Korea’s war readiness as he declared the abandonment of the goal of unification with South Korea. KCNA reported on March 25 that he supervised a tank exercise by the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division – the first military unit that reached Seoul in a surprise attack in 1950 that triggered the Korean War.
Concurrently, ties between Japan and South Korea are blossoming, while their trilateral partnership with the US is being strengthened.
North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programme has advanced by leaps and bounds since 2002, when the abduction issue was top of the agenda.
Pyongyang has launched a military reconnaissance satellite into space, and now possesses intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of striking the US. It has also flown missiles over Japanese territory into the Pacific Ocean.
Ms Kim said on March 25 that Pyongyang will treat Tokyo as its “forever enemy and never friend” if Japan remains hostile. But she added that its arsenal will “never be a threat to the security of Japan”, so long as Tokyo respects North Korea’s sovereignty and legitimate security interests.
Prof Isozaki noted that there has been no change to North Korea’s policy to strengthen its military capabilities, making it extremely unlikely for Mr Kishida to extract any concessions.
Japan’s most-read newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, questioned in a commentary if North Korea was trying to drive a wedge between the US and its two allies in its charm offensive.
“Kishida should not take advantage of the matter for the sake of his own political ambition,” the commentary said. “If he does, it may cause a political and diplomatic disaster in Japan, South Korea and the United States, undermining the trilateral relationship.”",2024-03-26T15:36:55Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
North Korea censors Alan Titchmarsh's trousers on BBC gardening show,"North Korea's state TV channel has censored Alan Titchmarsh's trousers.
On Monday, Korean Central Television was showing an episode of the 2010 BBC series of Gardening Secrets, featuring the famous gardener and broadcaster.
The show was said to be a condensed version of the original, and at one point broadcasters blurred out Mr Titchmarsh's jeans.
In the scene Mr Titchmarsh is kneeling in a garden, tending to plants, when the blurred effect is applied to his legs.
It doesn't hide the fact he's wearing trousers, just obscures them. The BBC first revealed the move.
The censoring is said to be linked to Kim Jong Un's regime's efforts to restrict Western fashion and culture in North Korea, NKNews reports.
Blue jeans are said to be a sign of the West, according to the outlet, and have been essentially banned since the 1990s.
This is despite the country briefly exporting designer jeans to Sweden.

New Samsung Galaxy S24 software update aims to solve camera issues - but there’s a catch,"Samsung has begun to roll out the April update for the Galaxy S24 series, which aims to fix several camera issues.
Firmware version S928NKSU1AXCA, as the update is officially titled, weighs in at a hefty 797.83 MB, and will bring improvements for several areas according to a post on the Samsung Korea forum. These include low-light images, image colors in the ExpertRAW app, improved text clarity when zooming in photo mode and support for 480 x 480 resolution in Instant Slow-Mo.
The update is only available in South Korea at the moment, but it's expected that Samsung will release it in other countries in the next few days.
This all builds on Samsung's February update for the Galaxy S24, which included patches for better zoom, portrait mode, night mode and rear camera video capture capabilities. However, that update was primarily focused on solving issues with the vivid display mode on the phone.
(Image credit: Tom's Guide)
When Samsung revealed the details of the Galaxy S24 cameras, there were complaints that the developer had skimped on the camera hardware for the phone as the cameras between the Galaxy S24 and the Galaxy S23 were almost identical. However, Samsung did add several new processing and editing features through Galaxy AI, the S24 series' headline update.
Galaxy AI offers a wealth of editing and upscaling options for the Galaxy S24 series. For instance, users can use the Magic Editing Tool to clean up or expand photos with ease, or add slow-mo sections to any video with a tap of the screen.
The Galaxy S24 Ultra is currently No. 2 on our best camera phones of 2024 buit it lost to Apple's flagship in our iPhone 15 Pro Max vs Galaxy S24 Ultra camera shootout. However, Samsung clearly isn't standing still and these upgrades could make a big difference. We will be sure to test them out once the update becomes available and report back.

FACT CHECK: No warships to be sent from South Korea to PH this year,"This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article.
The Philippine Navy is expected to have at least 12 vessels from South Korea by 2028, contrary to a false claim that the delivery is scheduled in 2024
Claim: The Philippines is set to receive 12 large warships from South Korea this year.
Rating: FALSE
Why we fact-checked this: The claim was made in the title of a YouTube video that has garnered 4,892 views, 174 likes, and 9 comments as of writing.
The video’s title says: “Ang South Korea ay muling nagpapadala ng 12 malalaking barkong pandigma sa Pilipinas ngayong taon” (South Korea is once again sending 12 large warships to the Philippines this year.)
The bottom line: The Philippines is expected to have at least 12 vessels, including offshore patrol vessels, corvettes, and frigates, from South Korea by 2028, according to Naval News.
In 2021, the Philippines signed a contract with South Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries for two missile corvettes, but these are not yet scheduled for delivery this year. The first missile corvette is set to be delivered by 2025, with the second in 2026. Meanwhile, six offshore patrol vessels are set to be delivered to the Philippines by 2028.
There are also no official announcements from the Philippines’ Department of National Defense or the Korean embassy in the Philippines regarding the claim of a supposed ship delivery this year.
South Korea and the Philippine Navy: South Korea has been involved in the Philippine Navy’s modernization program for years. Seoul has supplied the Philippine Navy with some of its most advanced warships to boost its maritime capabilities, such as the BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150) and BRP Antonio Luna (BRP-151), as well as the Pohang-class corvette Chungju (PCC-762), now known as BRP Conrado Yap (PS-39).
Unrelated clips: The video also shows unrelated clips of different ships. One of the ships shown at the 50-second mark of the video is the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), which arrived in South Korea for a port visit on October 12, 2023.

"North Korea says no interest in holding summit with Japan, rejects further talks","With no prompting from me whatsoever — out of the blue — a freshly retired and otherwise mild-mannered electrical engineer that I have known for 50 years from western Pennsylvania opined to me this past Friday about Donald Trump’s classified documents trial.
That my friend was so completely pissed off about a federal district court proceeding in Florida tells you everything you need to know about the pivotal moment we face as a nation.
Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, has routinely demonstrated herself to be a jurist of significant incompetence and ignorance, culminating last week when she issued an order to defense lawyers and prosecutors that, according to the Washington Post, “badly misstates the law and facts of the case.”
ALSO READ: 11 ways Trump doesn’t become president
Well before Cannon became the presiding judge in Trump’s classified documents and obstruction of justice case, she had been under legal scrutiny for how she handled jurisdictional discretion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
So let’s step back a couple of years and move forward from there to best understand why Cannon today is not fit to preside over Trump’s case.
It all began when Cannon “ let loose with a decision breathtaking in its disregard for both the law and the judicial branch’s legitimacy .”
Back in September 2022, Cannon issued two rulings on the government’s investigation into the missing documents.
One ruling was to appoint a “special master” to review the materials seized by the FBI . The other was to “temporarily enjoin” the Department of Justice from any further examination of hundreds of boxes of missing documents belonging to the National Archives and Records Administration that had been scattered about Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s winter home and country club in Palm Beach, Fla.
At the time, Amanda Marcotte, senior politics writer for Salon and author of Troll Nation : How the Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set on Rat-F-----g Liberals, America, and Truth Itself (2018), enunciated that Cannon’s “ruling employs the same logic as the Big Lie and the Capitol insurrection.”
Cannon had ruled affirmatively on Trump’s behalf in response to his lawyers filing a spurious civil action to block the Department of Justice from using evidence lawfully obtained following the execution of a FBI search warrant.

These two rulings or orders by Cannon were the first of several controversial ones to come. They have been poorly, if not, unlawfully adjudicated with respect to both the facts and the law. Her decisions notably have included the jury being allowed to see classified documents and the names of government witnesses released to the public.
Most recently, the judge asked for proposed jury instructions from the parties that allow for the defense to assert that Trump could have declassified documents without using the normal declassification procedures where there would have been an official record.
Also, rather than ruling against Trump’s motion to dismiss the case, Cannon deferred based on some parts of the Espionage Act, which allows it to be litigated again sometime in the future.

These rulings have been needlessly slowing down the wheels of justice for the better part of two years and a trial date has yet to be established. As Philip Rotner has written for The Bulwark , Cannon “is trying to kill the Trump documents” case “one cut at a time” as she keeps demonstrating that she may be Trump’s “last and perhaps only line of defense.”
Even before the unanimous per curiam decision by the 11 th Circuit vacated her order to appoint a special master to oversee the review of the classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago, legal observers were accusing the judge of “obstruction of justice.” These critics were also thinking out loud that Cannon has already demonstrated that she should recuse herself for cause.
The vacating of Cannon’s order was less than two weeks after Attorney General Merrick Garland had announced his appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith on November 18, 2022, to oversee the two ongoing investigations initiated earlier by the Department of Justice.
After dragging his feet for the better part of two years, Garland — in appointing Smith — did what he should have done when he was sworn into office back on March 11, 2021, one month after the Republican Senate had “jury nullified” the impeachment of Trump for a second time.

In any event, these two criminal cases have never been the “witch hunts” that Trump and his allies claim. Then again, the former president and his supporters may be correct that without Trump having declared himself running once again for the presidency less than 48 hours before, the special counsel appointment may never have happened.
Whatever the reality might have been, on June 8, 2023, in Florida, a federal grand jury indicted Trump. The case was randomly “reassigned” to Cannon with a one in three probability. After a “superseding indictment” was filed on August 1, Trump found himself facing 37 charges related to the illegal possession of classified documents and the obstruction of justice.
The amended indictment added three more charges alleging Trump and his two co-conspirators had sought to delete what could well be very incriminating security footage of the classified documents being moved around Mar-a-Lago and off of the property as well.
When Cannon was “bench-slapped” by the 11th Circuit many in the prosecutorial world thought that Smith should file a motion asking her to recuse. These former prosecutors and other legal commentators were all keenly aware of the downside for doing so especially in relation to delaying the case further.
Since Trump was criminally indicted, Cannon has continued to issue legally questionable and unsound rulings. Cannon’s “malfeasance” in fact has interjected an accumulation of unnecessary delays for the trial of Trump and his two co-defendants, property manager Carlos De Oliveira and bodyguard Walt Nauta.
Back in November, Cannon’s “ unwarranted animus towards the government ” was on full display according to former U.S. prosecutor Joyce Vance when prosecutors alerted the judge that Trump’s lawyers were “playing both sides against the middle” or gaming the system to acquire more delay. Rather than chastise the defense or at least both sides, Cannon only chastised the government.
With respect to one of the judge’s rulings early last month to “ unseal the identities of two dozen potential witnesses, along with sensitive information they provided to the government ,” special counsel Smith, on Feb. 8, asked for a reconsideration and stay because of a “clear error” and “manifest injustice.”
Once again legal commentators chimed in and were recommending Smith make a motion for Cannon to recuse.
After needlessly hearing oral arguments a week ago last Thursday, Cannon issued an absurdly reasoned two-page order . This ruling by the judge may very well be the straw that breaks the judge’s back so to speak.
On the one hand, Cannon rebuffed Trump’s lawyers’ argument that the central statute in the indictment, the Espionage Act, “ was impermissibly vague and should be struck down entirely .”
On the other hand, the judge ruled without prejudice which means that it could be raised again at trial. Which means that either the jury or Cannon could dismiss the entire case against Trump and his co-defendants should they find grounds for doing so. If that were to occur, the government could neither appeal the decision to a higher court nor could they try the case again because of the double jeopardy clause.
With respect to the making or not making of a motion to recuse Cannon, until the most recent decisions, Smith was damned if he did make such a motion and damned if he did not.
In the former, it would mean a delay whether the motion succeeded or failed. And if it succeeded that would mean an even longer delay as the next judge would need time for getting up to speed. Which in all likelihood would push any classified documents trial to after the 2024 election. In the latter, it would mean going into trial with the possibility of losing the case all because of a f----d up ruling by the judge.
In sum, whether one thinks the judge’s rulings are bad, biased, corrupt, perplexing or simply incompetent, they are sabotaging the administration of justice and making a mockery of the rule of law.
Cannon needs to be exorcized from the USA v. Trump et al. as soon as possible.",2024-03-26T11:09:31Z,https://www.rawstory.com,Raw Story

Alginate-based hydrogel developed for treatment of retinal detachment,"It's taboo to consume seaweed soup before exams in Korea since it can lead to failing the exam. The belief is rooted in the idea that the slippery nature of seaweed may cause people to slip and falter during the test. The slick surface of seaweeds such as seaweed and kelp is attributed to alginate, a mucilaginous substance. Notably, an intriguing study exploring the use of alginate for the treatment of retinal detachment has been recently published.
A collaborative effort between Professor Hyung Joon Cha from the Department of Chemical Engineering and the School of Convergence Science and Technology and Dr. Geunho Choi from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), and Professor Woo Jin Jeong, Professor Woo Chan Park, and Professor Seoung Hyun An from the Dong-A University Hospital's Department of Ophthalmology has resulted in the creation of an artificial vitreous body for treating retinal detachment. This solution is based on a natural carbohydrate derived from algae. The research findings were recently published in Biomaterials, an international journal of biomaterials published by Elsevier.
The vitreous body is a gel-like substance that occupies the space between the lens and retina, contributing to the eye's structural integrity. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the inner wall of the eye and moves into the vitreous cavity, leading to detachment and potentially resulting in blindness in severe cases. While a common approach involves removing the vitreous body and substituting it with medical intraocular fillers like expandable gas or silicone oil, these fillers have been associated with various side effects.
To address these concerns, the research team employed a modified form of alginate, a natural carbohydrate sourced from algae. Alginate, also known as alginic acid, is widely utilized in various industries, including food and medicine, for its ability to create viscous products. In this research, the team crafted a medical composite hydrogel based on alginate, offering a potential alternative for vitreous replacement.
The hydrogel, possessing high biocompatibility and optical properties akin to authentic vitreous body, enables patients to preserve their vision post-surgery. Its distinctive viscoelasticity effectively regulates fluid dynamics within the eye, contributing to retinal stabilization and the elimination of air bubbles.
To validate the hydrogel's stability and effectiveness, the team conducted experiments using animal models, specifically rabbit eyes, which closely resemble human eyes in structure, size, and physiological response. Implanting the hydrogel into rabbit eyes demonstrated its success in preventing the recurrence of retinal detachment, maintaining stability, and functioning well over an extended period without any adverse effects.
Professor Hyung Joon Cha of the POSTECH who led the study remarked, ""There is a correlation between retinal detachment and severe myopia and the prevalence of retinal detachment is increasing, particularly in young people. The incidence of retinal detachment cases in Korea rose by 50% in 2022 compared to 2017."" He expressed the team's commitment by saying, ""Our team will enhance and progress the technology to make the hydrogel suitable for practical use in real-world eye care through ongoing research.""
The worldwide market for intraocular fillers is expanding at a rate of 3% per year."" He added, ""We anticipate that the hydrogel we've created will prove beneficial in upcoming vitreoretinal surgeries."" Professor Woo Jin Jeong, Dong-A University Hospital

"Ohtani to make first public comments since illegal gambling, theft allegations against interpreter","Open this photo in gallery: Los Angeles Dodgers DH Shohei Ohtani warms up before a game against the Los Angeles Angels, at Dodger Stadium, on March 24.Harry How/Getty Images
Shohei Ohtani is set to make his first public comments Monday since his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired following allegations of illegal gambling and theft from the Los Angeles Dodgers star.
Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers last week when the team opened the season with two games against the San Diego Padres in Seoul, South Korea.
Mizuhara was let go from the team following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker and claims from Ohtani’s attorneys that the Japanese star had been the victim of a “massive theft.”
Major League Baseball has opened an investigation of the matter. The Internal Revenue Service has confirmed that Mizuhara and Mathew Bowyer, the alleged illegal bookmaker in Orange County, California, are under criminal investigation.
Mizuhara told ESPN he had gambling debts that totaled well over $1-million and initially said Ohtani had paid those off at Mizuhara’s request. He later changed his story, telling ESPN that Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers. Ohtani’s attorneys have said Ohtani was the victim of a “massive theft.”
The Associated Press has been unable reach Mizuhara for comment. It is not clear if he has an attorney. Mizuhara was with the team in South Korea up until his firing. It’s unknown if he left the country.
Will Ireton, the Dodgers’ performance operations manager, has taken over translation duties for Ohtani. He previously did the same for then-Dodgers pitcher Kenta Maeda, who is Japanese.
On Sunday, Manager Dave Roberts endorsed Ohtani addressing the matter publicly. He said it was the two-way superstar’s decision to do so.
“It’s the right thing to do,” Roberts said. “I’m happy he’s going to speak and speak to what he knows and give his thoughts on the whole situation. I think it will give us all a little bit more clarity.”
Ohtani is also expected to play in exhibition games Monday in Los Angeles and Tuesday in Anaheim, where he was a two-time AL MVP before leaving the Angels as a free agent to sign a record $700-million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in December.
Roberts said Ohtani has not addressed his teammates as a group.
“I think that he’s had one-off conversations with players,” Roberts said.
The manager said he checked in with Ohtani to see how he’s doing.
“He’s kind of business as usual,” Roberts said.",2024-03-25T17:31:20Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail
Son Jun-ho: South Korean footballer released after detention in China,"Last updated on .From the section Football

South Korean footballer Son Jun-ho has been released after being detained in China in relation to a bribery case, South Korea's foreign ministry says.
Chinese Super League player Son, 31, was detained in May 2023 amid a crackdown on corruption and match-fixing in Chinese football.
China's foreign ministry said South Korean international Son was suspected of accepting bribes.
Son moved to China's Shandong province in 2021 to join Shandong Taishan.

North Korea's Kim Jong Un Doubles Down on Hostility With South,"North Korea has dismantled an influential organization formed to promote eventual reunification with the South, with Pyongyang-Seoul relations at their most fraught in decades.
During a Saturday meeting of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea's Central Committee, members decided the DFRK was no longer necessary at a time of hostility with ""principal enemy"" Seoul and formally dissolved it, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday.
The nearly eight-decades-old DFRK was the latest result of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's campaign to purge any references to a reunification with the South. A formal peace treaty between the two countries has never been signed despite the end of open hostilities in 1953, when the Korean War ended.
The move comes after Kim declared that continuing to pursue a rapprochement with Seoul was no longer possible and that Pyongyang should amend its constitution to brand the South as its ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy.""
In January, the country's rubber-stamp parliament abolished several organizations involved in what limited inter-Korean cooperation existed, including the one handling relations with the South.
During Saturday's meeting, it was determined that Seoul was not a ""partner for reconciliation and reunification"" but rather ""the most hostile state, invariable principal enemy and completely foreign country."" Central Committee members reached a consensus to dissolve the DFRK.
North Korea's embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Bong-geun Jun, a nonresident senior advisor for Northeast Asia at the United States Institute for Peace, wrote last month that the North's shift away from talk of reconciliation indicates that Pyongyang realizes it has lost the ""unification competition.""
""Historically, unification is possible only when the stronger country absorbs the weaker one militarily or peacefully. Today, South Korea is a leading middle power, while North Korea is an isolated rogue state,"" Jun wrote.
Established in 1946, the DFRK was a political alliance in North Korea aimed at promoting the reunification of Korea under North Korea's terms.
It functioned primarily as a tool for the Korean Workers' Party to unify domestic support for its policies and vision of Korean reunification, which emphasized the North's leadership over the entire peninsula without foreign intervention, particularly from the United States.
Tensions between the neighbors have ratcheted up in recent months amid the North's ballistic missile tests, artillery drills held near South Korean islands, and the end of a landmark 2018 military agreement meant to defuse tensions.",2024-03-25T15:11:33Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
North Korea claims Japanese PM requested summit with Kim Jong Un,"Kishida’s request is unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo, which has historically strained relations.
Kishida expressed a desire to improve ties, which Pyongyang has hinted it is not opposed to.
Analysts suggest that North Korea’s statement could be an attempt by Pyongyang to negotiate terms for a future summit.

On Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s powerful sister stated that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has requested a summit with her brother. She added that a meeting was unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo. Historically strained relations between the two countries include a long-running kidnapping dispute and North Korea’s banned weapons programs, but Kishida has recently expressed a desire to improve ties, hinting at Pyongyang’s non-opposition.
Last year, Kishida stated that he was willing to meet Kim “without any conditions,” asserting that Tokyo was ready to resolve all issues, including the abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, which remains an emotive issue in Japan.
“Kishida… conveyed his intention to personally meet the President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as soon as possible,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.
Last month, Kim Yo Jong — one of the regime’s key spokespeople — hinted at a possible future invitation for the Japanese leader to visit North Korea.
However, she emphasized that the “history of the DPRK-Japan relations gives a lesson that it is impossible to improve the bilateral relations full of distrust and misunderstanding,” without a substantive policy change on Tokyo’s part.
She warned that if Japan were to remain “engrossed in the abduction issue that has no further settlement,” then Kishida’s hopes of improving ties would not materialize.

On Monday, Kishida stated that he was not aware of the KCNA report and did not directly comment on its contents while emphasizing the importance of top-level talks with North Korea.
“For Japan-North Korea relations, top-level talks are important to resolve issues such as the abduction issue,” Kishida said in parliament, referring to kidnappings that took place in the 1970s and ‘80s.
“This is why we have been making various approaches to North Korea at the level directly under my control, as I have said in the past.”
In 2002, North Korea admitted to sending agents to kidnap 13 Japanese people in the 1970s and ’80s, whom they used to train spies in Japanese language and customs.
The abductions remain a potent and emotional issue in Japan, and many suspect that officials have not recognized the full extent of the abductions.
Analysts have long stated that contention over the issue could hinder progress toward a summit between Kishida and Kim Jong Un.

However, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, suggested that North Korea’s statement seemed to be an attempt by Pyongyang to negotiate terms for any future summit between the two countries’ leaders.
“It seems the North sees there’s no point in making contact with the Japanese side without checking what requirements each side has in mind that could lead to nothing after all if those requirements are too different to reconcile,” Hong said.
“It is Pyongyang’s way of testing how serious Japan is in holding the meeting and setting its summit prerequisites to host the meeting.”
While in office in 2002, Japan’s former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made a landmark visit to Pyongyang, where he met with Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, and outlined a path to normalize relations, involving Japan offering economic assistance.
The trip resulted in the return of five Japanese nationals and a subsequent visit by Koizumi. However, the diplomacy soon broke down, partly due to Tokyo’s concern that North Korea was not being transparent about the abduction victims.
Kim Yo Jong said that Kishida “should not think that he can meet our state leadership when he has wanted and decided.”

“If Japan truly wants to improve the bilateral relations and contribute to ensuring regional peace and stability as a close neighbor of the DPRK, it must make a political decision for strategic option conformed to its overall interests,” she added.",2024-03-25T14:37:58Z,https://www.bolnews.com,BOL News
Japan’s Kishida ‘proposed’ summit with Kim Jong Un,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the North urged Japan to show sincerity toward improving bilateral ties and realizing their countries’ first summit in about 20 years.
Japan’s government did not immediately respond to the North Korean announcement. In the statement carried by state media, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said Kishida used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person at an early date.
Kim Yo Jong said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government raises the issue of Japanese citizens abducted to North Korea in past decades and opposes what she described as the North’s “exercise of sovereign rights,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
Open to talks
In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement on bilateral ties, saying North Korea was open to improving relationships with Japan and even inviting Kishida to Pyongyang. But she said those would be possible only if Tokyo “drops its bad habit of unreasonably pulling up (North Korea) over its legitimate right to self-defense and does not lay such a stumbling block as the already settled abduction issue.”
Kishida has said previously that he believes a summit with Kim Jong Un is important in various ways, including solving the problem of the abducted Japanese citizens. Japanese media reported he said he wasn’t aware of the North Korean announcement when he was asked about it in parliament Monday.
Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken a trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants better ties with North Korea to increase his declining approval rating at home.

North Korea admitted in 2002 that it had sent agents to kidnap 13 Japanese people in the 1970s and '80s who were used to train spies in Japanese language and customs.
The abductions remain a potent and emotional issue in Japan and suspicions persist that many more were abducted than have been officially recognized.
Sakie Yokota, 88, whose daughter Megumi is among the missing abductees, told Japanese media on Monday that she wanted the two countries to hold talks ""as soon as possible"".
""I don't know if talks will take place, because it's North Korea, but I hope even a small step will be made. We really don't have much time left,"" she said.
Earlier this month, Atsuhito Isozaki, a North Korea expert and professor at Keio University, told reporters it would be ""extremely hard"" for Japan to accept the North's claim that the abduction issue is resolved.
The question ""is whether Kishida can convince the Japanese public that Japan-North Korea relations are very important,"" to the extent that it is necessary to make some concessions to improve bilateral ties.

Kim Jong Un visits tank unit; North Korea says Japan wants summit,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea, the North’s state media said Monday.
Kim made those comments Sunday while visiting his top tank group, the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division. The unit’s name marks how it was the first North Korean military unit to reach the South Korean capital in 1950 when a North Korean surprise attack triggered a war that dragged on for almost four years.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have heightened after Kim in past months dialed up his military demonstrations, including tests of nuclear-capable missiles designed to target South Korea, the United States and Japan, while issuing threats of nuclear conflict against its rivals.
Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and updating their deterrence plans built around strategic U.S. assets.
Also Monday, North Korea said that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida offered to meet with Kim “as soon as possible,” but stressed that prospects for their countries first summit in about 20 years would depend on Tokyo tolerating its weapons program and ignoring its past abductions of Japanese nationals.
In a parliamentary session, Kishida said that a meeting with Kim is “crucial” to resolve the abduction issue, a major sticking point in bilateral ties, and that his government has been using various channels to hold the summit.
Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said in a statement that Kishida recently used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person “as soon as possible.”
She said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government is engrossed in the abduction issue and interferes in the North’s “exercise of our sovereign right,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken the trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants to use possible progress in the abduction issue to increase his declining approval rating at home.
North Korea and Japan don’t have diplomatic ties, and their relations have been overshadowed by North Korea’s nuclear program, the abduction issue and Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Japan’s colonial wrongdoing is a source of on-again, off-again history wrangling between Tokyo and Seoul, as well.
There are concerns North Korea could further dial up pressure on its rivals and intensify its weapons testing activities in what is an election year in both the United States and South Korea. Kim Jong Un has supervised a series of missile tests and other military drills this year.
Photos published by North Korean state media on Monday showed Kim talking with military officers at an observation post and tanks with North Korean flags rolling through dirt, with at least one of the vehicles carrying a sign that read: “Annihilate U.S. invaders who are staunch enemies of the Korean people!”",2024-03-25T08:52:12Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
North Korea says Japanese PM Kishida requested summit,"1 of 2 | Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said Monday that Japanese Prime Minster Fumio Kishida reached out to request a summit. File Pool Photo by Jorge Silva/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, March 25 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's influential sister said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has requested a summit ""as soon as possible,"" but warned that Tokyo would have to steer clear of contentious issues for any meeting to take place. According to Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, the Japanese prime minister reached out through an unspecified channel with the request. Advertisement
""Shortly ago, Kishida, through another channel, conveyed his intention to personally meet the President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as soon as possible,"" she said in a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
Kishida has publicly called for a summit on several occasions. At a policy speech in January, he said he wanted to meet with Kim to help raise Japan-North Korea relations to a ""new stage"" and resolve the longstanding issue of the North's abductions of Japanese citizens.
The prime minister also brought it up at the U.N. General Assembly last year, saying he was determined to meet the North Korean leader face-to-face without any conditions.

Kim Yo Jong issued a response in February, signaling that North Korea was open to improving relations and potentially hosting a visit from Kishida.
However, she cautioned at the time that Tokyo would have to drop its criticisms of Pyongyang's illicit missile and nuclear programs and set aside the abduction issue before any steps could be taken.
On Monday, she again warned Japan against ""interfering in the exercise of our sovereign right [or] being engrossed in the abduction issue that has no further settlement.""
""If Japan truly wants to improve the bilateral relations and contribute to ensuring regional peace and stability as a close neighbor of the DPRK, it is necessary for it to make a political decision for strategic option conformed to its overall interests,"" Kim said.
She added that the nuclear-armed North would never pose a threat to Japan ""if the latter respects the former's sovereignty and security interests in a fair and equal stand.""
Kishida told parliament on Monday that he was not aware of the media reports on Kim's comments, but reiterated that his government was still pursuing a summit.
""Top-level talks are important in order to resolve various issues such as the abduction issue,"" Kishida said, according to broadcaster NHK. ""As I have said in the past, we have been making efforts to encourage this.""

South Korea protests: Senior doctors to submit resignations in support of strikes,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Senior doctors at dozens of hospitals in South Korea planned to submit their resignations Monday in support of medical interns and residents who have been on a strike for five weeks over the government’s push to sharply increase medical school admissions, their leader said.
The senior doctors’ action won’t likely cause an immediate worsening of hospital operations in South Korea because they have said they would continue to work even after submitting their resignations. But prospects for an early end to the medical impasse were also dim, as the doctors’ planned action comes after President Yoon Suk Yeol called for talks with doctors while suggesting a possible softening of punitive steps against the striking junior doctors.
About 12,000 interns and medical residents have faced impending suspensions of their licenses over their refusal to end their strikes, which have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals.
They oppose the government’s plan to increase the country’s medical school admission cap by two-thirds, saying schools can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that it would eventually hurt South Korea’s medical services. But officials say more doctors are urgently needed because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world.
In a meeting with ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon on Sunday, representatives of medical professors and doctors at some 40 university hospitals — where the junior doctors work while training — expressed support for the striking doctors, saying the government’s recruitment plan “would collapse our country’s medical system,” Kim Chang-soo, head of the emergency committee at those universities, said Monday.
Kim called Yoon’s overture a positive step but said the current standoff between doctors and the government won’t be resolved unless the government rolls back its recruitment plan.
He said doctors at the universities were expected to stick to earlier plans to submit resignations voluntarily and cut back their working hours to 52 hours per week — the maximum weekly number of legal working hours. Observers say senior doctors have been grappling with excessive workloads after their juniors left their hospitals.
“If the government has an intention of withdrawing its plan or has an intention of considering it, we’re ready to discuss all pending issues with the government before the public,” Kim said.
After Sunday’s meeting, Han asked Yoon’s office to “flexibly handle” the issue of planned license suspensions for the striking doctors. Yoon then asked his prime minister to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors, according to Yoon’s office.
It’s unclear whether and how soon the government and doctors would sit down for talks and reach a breakthrough. Some observers say the government’s likely softening of punishments for the striking doctors and its pursuit of dialogue with doctors were likely related to next month’s parliamentary elections as further disruptions of hospital operations would be unhelpful for ruling party candidates.
The striking junior doctors represent less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors, and critics say that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to a rise in the number of doctors.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-03-25T07:59:24Z,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press

Observers say Kim wants improved ties with Japan as a way to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies, while Kishida wants to use possible progress in the abduction issue to boost his declining approval rating at home. But they say it would be highly unlikely for a Kim-Kishida summit to happen anytime soon because North Korea has set preconditions that Japan can’t accept.
Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said in a statement that Kishida recently used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person “as soon as possible.”
She said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government is engrossed in the abduction issue and interferes in the North’s “exercise of our sovereign right,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
“The history of the DPRK-Japan relations gives a lesson that it is impossible to improve the bilateral relations full of distrust and misunderstanding, only with an idea to set out on a summit meeting,” Kim Yo Jong said, using the abbreviation of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
“If Japan truly wants to improve the bilateral relations and contribute to ensuring regional peace and stability as a close neighbor of the DPRK, it is necessary for it to make a political decision for a strategic option conformed to its overall interests,” she said.
In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement, saying North Korea was open to inviting Kishida to Pyongyang but that it would only be possible if Tokyo stopped taking issue with North Korea’s legitimate right to self-defense and the abduction issue.
North Korea and Japan don’t have diplomatic ties, and their relations have been overshadowed by North Korea’s nuclear program, the abduction issue and Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Japan’s colonial wrongdoing is a source of on-again, off-again wrangling between Tokyo and Seoul, as well.
After years of denial, North Korea acknowledged in an unprecedented 2002 summit between Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, and then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese, mainly to train spies in Japanese language and culture. It allowed five of them to return to Japan that year, but said the others had died. Japan thinks at least some of them may still be alive, and believes hundreds more may also have been abducted.
In 2004, Koizumi made a second visit to North Korea and met Kim Jong Il again. That was the last summit between the leaders of the two countries.
Talk of a possible North Korea-Japan summit comes amid concerns that North Korea could further intensify its weapons testing activities in what is an election year both in the U.S. and South Korea. Experts say North Korea would aim to use an enlarged weapons arsenal to win concessions from the U.S. such as sanctions relief.
“While North Korea may be waiting out elections in South Korea and the United States before reengaging those countries in diplomacy, it probably wants to strengthen its hand by developing weapons and driving wedges between U.S. allies,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “Kishida feels political urgency to address the abductions issue and is thus showing diplomatic effort.”
The impoverished North also likely thinks about possible Japanese economic assistance it could receive if the two countries normalized their ties, said analyst Moon Seong Mook with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. He said North Korea could seek the current value of the Japanese assistance that South Korea received when those two countries normalized their ties in 1965 — $500 million — or more.
Moon said Kishida won’t likely make concessions on the abduction issue or North Korea’s nuclear program in defiance of public sentiments and U.N. resolutions, respectively. Easley said a Kim-Kishida summit is unlikely because Pyongyang appears unwilling to address its historical kidnapping of Japanese citizens and Tokyo is unable to relax sanctions on North Korea.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Monday it was closely communicating with Japan on Tokyo-Pyongyang contacts and the North Korean nuclear issue. It said that South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are working closely together to return North Korea to a path of denuclearization.
North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile arsenals pose a major security threat to Japan as well as South Korea and the United States. The three countries have expanded their trilateral training exercises in response to the North’s provocative run of weapons tests since 2022. Japan and South Korea are two of America’s key allies in the region, together hosting about 80,000 U.S. troops in their territories.
Earlier Monday, North Korea’s state media reported that Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea.
While most analysts doubt Kim is genuinely preparing for war, South Korean officials have raised the possibility of smaller provocations in border regions, including the disputed western sea boundary between the Koreas that has been the site of bloody skirmishes in past years.

North Korean leader Kim visits tank unit and touts war preparations in face of tensions with Seoul,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea, the North’s state media said Monday.
Kim made those comments Sunday while visiting his top tank group, the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division. The unit’s name marks how it was the first North Korean military unit to reach the South Korean capital in 1950 when a North Korean surprise attack triggered a war that dragged on for almost four years.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have heightened after Kim in past months dialed up his military demonstrations, including tests of nuclear-capable missiles designed to target South Korea, the United States and Japan, while issuing threats of nuclear conflict against its rivals.
Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and updating their deterrence plans built around strategic U.S. assets.
Photos published by North Korean state media showed Kim talking with military officers at an observation post and tanks with North Korean flags rolling through dirt, with at least one of the vehicles carrying a sign that read: “Annihilate U.S. invaders who are staunch enemies of the Korean people!”
The official Korean Central News Agency said Kim praised the 105th Division as a model for his entire army “in the ongoing struggle … for finishing war preparations.” He also issued instructions to improve the unit’s combat preparations and upgrade its equipment, the report said.
Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were closely monitoring North Korean military activities but did not provide a specific assessment of the details reported by North Korean state media.
Kim earlier this month supervised a training competition between his military’s tank units, which was won by the 105th Division. The event on March 13 also featured a new North Korean battle tank meant to underscore Kim’s efforts to strengthen his conventional military capabilities along with his arsenal of missiles.
Last week, North Korea conducted a live-fire drill of large-size multiple rocket launchers designed to target Seoul and also claimed a successful engine test in its efforts to build a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile, which would be aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.
There are concerns North Korea could further dial up pressure in what is an election year in both the United States and South Korea.
While most analysts doubt Kim is genuinely preparing for war, South Korean officials have raised the possibility of smaller provocations in border regions, including the disputed western sea boundary between the Koreas that has been the site of bloody skirmishes in past years.
In a fiery speech to Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament in January, Kim declared that he was abandoning North Korea’s long-standing goal of reconciliation with the South and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to cement its war-divided rival as its most hostile adversary. He said the new charter must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.",2024-03-25T07:12:48Z,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press
North Korea claims Japan’s PM wants summit with Kim to ease tensions,"Seoul | North Korea said on Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, as North Korea urged Japan to show sincerity toward improving bilateral ties and realising their countries’ first summit in about 20 years.
Japan’s government did not immediately respond to the North Korean announcement. In the statement carried by state media, Mr Kim’s sister and senior official Kim Yo-jong said Mr Kishida used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong-un in person at an early date.

Kim Yo-jong said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Mr Kishida’s government raises the issue of Japanese citizens abducted to North Korea in past decades and opposes what she described as the North’s “exercise of sovereign rights,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
“If Japan continues to try to interfere with our exercise of our sovereign rights, and continues to be preoccupied with the abduction issue, of which there is nothing more to resolve or investigate, then the prime minister’s [offer for talks] will inevitably be labelled as just an attempt to improve his popularity,” she said.
“As long as Japan is hostile toward [North Korea] and infringes our sovereign rights, we will consider it as an enemy that is within our target, not as a friend,” Kim Yo-jong said. “The prime minister should know that he won’t be able to meet the leadership of our country just because he wants to or just because he’s determined to.”",2024-03-25T05:09:12Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review
South Korea doctors’ strike widens as medical professors join protests,"Medical professors in South Korea have said they will reduce the hours they spend in practice, while some say they plan to resign, in a widening of a doctors strike in the country.
The move will begin on Monday in support of trainee doctors who have been on strike for more than a month over a government plan to boost medical school admissions.
The president of the Medical Professors Association of Korea, Kim Chang-soo, said professors will start scaling back outpatient treatment to focus on emergency and severely ill patients, while others will submit their resignations.
“It is clear that increasing medical school admissions will not only ruin medical school education but cause our country’s healthcare system to collapse,” he said.
Trainee doctors have been on strike since 20 February over a plan to increase the number of students admitted each year to medical school from 2025 to address shortages in rural areas and greater demand on services caused by South Korea’s rapidly ageing population.
But the striking doctors, who make up 93% of the trainee workforce, claim the recruitment of 2,000 additional students a year from 2025 will compromise the quality of services. Critics have said the authorities should focus on improving the pay and working conditions of trainee doctors first.
The industrial action has forced several hospitals to turn back patients and delay procedures.
President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has made healthcare reforms one of his signature policy initiatives, has vowed not to back down on implementing the admissions plan.
South Korea’s government has also threatened to suspend the licences of the doctors who have walked off their jobs, but on Sunday Yoon appeared to seek a more conciliatory approach and urged prime minister Han Duck-soo to seek “flexible measures” in dealing with the suspension.
Yoon’s office said he also ordered the prime minister to form a “constructive consultative body” to speak with all medical professionals.
According to a Gallup poll released on 15 March, 38% said the government was doing a good job in dealing with the backlash from doctors to the plan and the medical void amid the doctors’ strike, while 49% said “not a good job”.",2024-03-25T04:42:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the North urged Japan to show sincerity toward improving bilateral ties and realizing their countries' first summit in about 20 years.

In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement on bilateral ties, saying North Korea was open to improving relationships with Japan and even inviting Kishida to Pyongyang. But she said those would be possible only if Tokyo “drops its bad habit of unreasonably pulling up (North Korea) over its legitimate right to self-defense and does not lay such a stumbling block as the already settled abduction issue.”
Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken a trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants better ties with North Korea to increase his declining approval rating at home.
The U.S. and South Korea have been expanding their military drills and trilateral exercises involving Japan in response to North Korea’s provocative run of weapons tests since 2022.

Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante,"Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-25T04:15:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de

"Senior doctors in South Korea to submit resignations, deepening dispute over medical school plan","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Senior doctors at dozens of hospitals in South Korea planned to submit their resignations Monday in support of medical interns and residents who have been on a strike for five weeks over the government’s push to sharply increase medical school admissions, their leader said.

The senior doctors' action won't likely cause an immediate worsening of hospital operations in South Korea because they have said they would continue to work even after submitting their resignations. But prospects for an early end to the medical impasse were also dim, as the doctors' planned action comes after President Yoon Suk Yeol called for talks with doctors while suggesting a possible softening of punitive steps against the striking junior doctors.

About 12,000 interns and medical residents have faced impending suspensions of their licenses over their refusal to end their strikes, which have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals.
Advertisement
They oppose the government's plan to increase the country's medical school admission cap by two-thirds, saying schools can't handle such a steep increase in students and that it would eventually hurt South Korea's medical services. But officials say more doctors are urgently needed because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world.

In a meeting with ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon on Sunday, representatives of medical professors and doctors at some 40 university hospitals — where the junior doctors work while training — expressed support for the striking doctors, saying the government's recruitment plan “would collapse our country's medical system,” Kim Chang-soo, head of the emergency committee at those universities, said Monday.
Kim called Yoon's overture a positive step but said the current standoff between doctors and the government won't be resolved unless the government rolls back its recruitment plan.

He said doctors at the universities were expected to stick to earlier plans to submit resignations voluntarily and cut back their working hours to 52 hours per week — the maximum weekly number of legal working hours. Observers say senior doctors have been grappling with excessive workloads after their juniors left their hospitals.
“If the government has an intention of withdrawing its plan or has an intention of considering it, we're ready to discuss all pending issues with the government before the public,” Kim said.

After Sunday's meeting, Han asked Yoon's office to “flexibly handle” the issue of planned license suspensions for the striking doctors. Yoon then asked his prime minister to pursue “a flexible measure"" to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors, according to Yoon's office.
It's unclear whether and how soon the government and doctors would sit down for talks and reach a breakthrough. Some observers say the government's likely softening of punishments for the striking doctors and its pursuit of dialogue with doctors were likely related to next month’s parliamentary elections as further disruptions of hospital operations would be unhelpful for ruling party candidates.

The striking junior doctors represent less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors, and critics say that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to a rise in the number of doctors.

Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-03-25T03:59:23Z,https://qz.com,Quartz India

But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-03-25T03:59:23Z,https://qz.com,Quartz India

North Korea says Japan’s prime minister proposed summit with leader Kim Jong Un,"North Korea has said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with leader Kim Jong Un.
Mr Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, made the comments in a state media dispatch on Monday.

She said Mr Kishida used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Mr Kim at an early date, but said improving bilateral ties hinges on Japan.

She said if Mr Kishida sticks to his push to resolve the alleged past abductions of Japanese nationals by North Korea, he cannot avoid criticism that he would only pursue talks to boost his popularity.

Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken a trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Mr Kishida also wants better ties with North Korea to increase his declining approval rating at home.

दुनिया की बड़ी महाशक्तियों का ध्यान उत्तर कोरिया की तरफ केंद्रित हो रहा है। हाल ही में रुस और उत्तर कोरिया के रिश्तों में जिस तरह से मजबूती आई है, उसे पूरी दुनिया ने देखा। अब जापान भी उत्तर कोरिया की तरफ अपना ध्यानाकर्षित कर रहा है। जापान ने कहा है कि वो बिना किसी शर्त के उत्तर कोरिया से बातचीत करना चाहता है।

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-24T18:02:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de
South Korea's Eunji Gim wins bronze at women's curling championships,"Gregory Strong, The Canadian Press
South Korea's Eunji Gim defeated Italy's Stefania Constantini 6-3 on Sunday to win bronze at the world women's curling championship.
Gim made a double-takeout to score three points in the 10th end to reach the world podium for the first time in five career appearances.
Canada's Rachel Homan was scheduled to play defending champion Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland in the final later in the day at Centre 200.
In the third-place game, neither team could manage a deuce in a quiet first half. Gim had a chance for a pair in the fourth end but settled for a single when her stone rolled out.
The South Korean skip's draw weight returned for the morning game after a poor showing in a semifinal loss to Canada the night before.
Gim drew for two points and a 3-2 lead in the sixth end but missed a chance for a force in the seventh with a rollout. Italy tied the game in the eighth end by playing a safer single rather than a tricky double-takeout.
The teams blanked the ninth and Italy was unable to force Gim to draw with her last throw in the 10th end.
Homan and her Ottawa-based team of Tracy Fleury, Emma Miskew and Sarah Wilkes will try to end Canada's six-year title drought at this event.
The Canadians have won all four head-to-head meetings against Tirinzoni this season but the Swiss skip has won four world titles in a row.
Homan's lone world title came at the 2017 playdowns in Beijing. Canada's Jennifer Jones won gold the following year in North Bay, Ont.
Homan ended Tirinzoni's 42-game win streak at this competition en route to an 11-1 round-robin record. The Canadian's lone defeat — which ended a 27-game overall win streak — was to Gim in a playoff tune-up on Friday with the top seed already secured.
The top-ranked Homan entered the final day with a season record of 61-6 and a 23-8 all-time mark in head-to-head matchups against the second-ranked Tirinzoni.

March 24 (UPI) -- Russian universities may consider accepting arts students from North Korea amid growing cooperation between the two countries. Russia's Vice Culture Minister Andrei Malyshev is leading a delegation to Pyongyang to discuss the future of cultural cooperation between the countries, including at museums and in the film industry. The delegation toured the Musical Art Museum in Pyongyang on Saturday. Advertisement
The Russian delegation arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday and said in a statement that Malyshev had already discussed ""promising areas of cooperation"" regarding arts and culture with North Korean officials.
The Russian Culture Ministry said Malyshev was asked to consider the possibility of sending Russian specialists to teach master classes in North Korea and conduct joint performances with North Korean theater and dance groups.
""Separately, the readiness of Russian creative universities to accept students from [North Korea] was noted,"" the Russian Culture Ministry said, adding that it invited North Korean officials to the International Children's Cultural Forum which will be held in August in Moscow.
And officials discussed organizing future exhibitions of work by North Korean artists in Russia while North Korea plans to host a Russian film festival in North Korea - particularly ""modern patriotic films"" that ""can arouse significant interest"" from viewers in the isolated country.

Meanwhile, North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un sent condolences to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday after a terrorist attack in Moscow killed at least 133 people. The news of the attack came as the Russian delegation was visiting North Korea.
""Having learned of the unexpected and sad news of the large-scale terrorist attack in Moscow Oblast, which resulted in the loss of many lives, I express in the name of the government and people of [North Korea] and myself my deepest condolences and sympathies to you and through you to the government and people of your country, the bereaved families and the victims,"" Kim said.
Kim, in his message to Putin, said that North Korea stands ""against all forms of terrorism"" and that ""nothing can justify the heinous act of terrorism that threatens human life.""
""Our people feel the misfortune and sorrow of the friendly people of Russia, and we extend our firm support and solidarity to your just cause to consolidate the social and political unity and stability centered on you, and to defend the security and sovereign rights of the country,"" Kim said.
""I sincerely wish your government and the resilient people of Russia a speedy recovery from the devastation caused by the terror attack, and peace to the bereaved families and victims.""",2024-03-24T16:25:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-24T03:52:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de
Canada's Homan advances to face Switzerland's Tirinzoni for gold at women's curling worlds,"Rachel Homan's season has been noteworthy for win streaks, dominant play and a surge to the top position in world rankings.
A 9-7 semifinal win over South Korea's Gim Eun-ji on Saturday has set her up for a potential high point of an already sterling campaign — and on home ice to boot.
Homan and her Ottawa-based team of Tracy Fleury, Emma Miskew and Sarah Wilkes will play defending champion Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland for gold on Sunday at the women's curling world championship in Sydney, N.S.
""We've had good success against them this year,"" said Canada coach Don Bartlett. ""But this is the game we've been waiting for.""

Canada's Homan to play for gold at women's curling worlds after win over South Korea Duration 1:38 Canada's Rachel Homan beats Gim Eun-ji of South Korea 9-7 in the semifinals at the women's curling world championship. Homan will face defending champion Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland in the championship game.
The showdown at Centre 200 will be a matchup of the top two teams in the world. Homan has won all four head-to-head meetings this season but Tirinzoni has won four straight world titles.
""We've trained and we've prepared for this moment,"" Homan said. ""We know that we're ready. We're going to give everything we can.""
Watch That Curling Show live from Sydney, N.S., immediately after Sunday's final on the CBC Sports YouTube channel.
Both teams had to outlast tough opponents to book their tickets to the final. South Korea shot a solid 82 per cent as a team but Gim and third Minji Kim struggled with draws.
Hit-and-roll attempts that weren't under full cover also proved costly. Homan made a double-takeout in the 10th end to sit three points and won the game by picking out Gim's draw that overcurled by half a rock.
""We made a lot of great shots in the last end to seal it,"" Miskew said.
The normally staid Homan let loose as she slid down the ice after the game-winning throw. She let out a yell and raised her arms in the air in celebration as the partisan crowd roared in delight.
She'll have a chance to win her first world title since 2017 in Beijing and end Canada's six-year drought at this event.
""She was outstanding all week,"" said South Korea coach Guy Hemmings. ""We just had to hold her one more end. We held her for nine ends but in the last end she got us.""

The teams exchanged singles over the next four ends before Canada picked up a deuce on a Homan draw to the button. Gim was heavy with two straight draws ahead of the Canadian skip's last throw.
In the ninth, Homan rubbed South Korea's stone on the four-foot ring to set up Gim for a soft hit to score two. Canada was pleased to be down one in the 10th end with the all-important hammer.

Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante,"Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante
Von: Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

"Strong possibility Russia will veto resolution on North Korea sanctions, UN diplomat says","There is a strong possibility Russia will veto a United Nations resolution on Friday calling for continuation of the mandate of an expert panel that monitors implementation of U.N. sanctions on North Korea, a U.N. diplomat told Reuters. Such a veto, at a vote expected on Friday afternoon, would mean dissolution of the Panel of Experts monitoring enforcement of long-standing UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It's a strong possibility that Russian vetoes this resolution,"" the diplomat said. ""That's unprecedented - basically it's been technical roll-overs for the last 14 years, I believe."" Russia's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The diplomat said if Russia were to veto, if would be the second time in a day that the permanent member of the Security Council had exercised that power, after Russia, and China, voted against a U.S.-proposed Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as part of a hostage deal. ""I think it would be the first time any country in the last 40 years has vetoed two different resolutions on two different files in the same day,"" the diplomat said.
A text of the resolution seen by Reuters calls for the extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts for another year until April 30, 2025. Another U.N. diplomat said that both Russia and China had sought ""sunset"" clauses to parts of the sanctions regime on North Korea and the text states the Security Council ""is prepared to review, by 30 April 2025, the appropriateness of measures taken to date.""
Such a review would cover possible ""strengthening, modification, suspension, or lifting of the measures as may be needed in light of (North Korea's) compliance,"" it said. The suggestion of a possible Russian veto comes after a closening of relations between North Korea and Russia since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The United States has charged that North Korea has supplied Russia with large quantities of artillery shells as well as ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have denied this even as they pledged to strengthen military cooperation. Last year Russia voted in favor of an extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts, but expressed regret that the resolution then did not include proposals on the need to minimize the impact of sanctions on the North Korean population and confidentiality issues concerning the panel.

Russia threatens Japan of 'serious consequences' if it Provides Ukraine with Patriot air defence systems,"Manufactured by the US defence contractor Raytheon, the Patriot is in service with the US and allied countries including Germany, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Poland, Sweden, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Romania, Spain, and Taiwan.
Nikolai Nozdrev, Russia’s recently appointed ambassador to Japan warned Tokyo regarding the potential transfer of Patriot missile systems produced under US license in Japan to Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported on Friday.
Nozdrev cautioned that such actions could lead to significant repercussions and prompt retaliatory measures from Moscow. The ambassador emphasized that Russia would closely monitor the destination of Japanese arms exports following Tokyo’s relaxation of export regulations in late 2023.

The MIM-104 Patriot (Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept On Target) missile system is the United States Army’s main air and missile defence system. It started as an anti-aircraft system, but over the years, newer variants can engage ballistic and cruise missiles, loitering munitions, and aircraft.
In particular, he said, Russia would be watching to see if and when any Patriot missile complexes and missiles made in Japan under U.S. licence are exported to the United States and then to Ukraine.
“Accordingly, we will be watching carefully to make sure that the Patriots delivered do not end up in Ukraine, because if that happens, there will be the most severe consequences for bilateral (Russia-Japan) relations, including our retaliatory steps,” RIA cited him as saying.
Manufactured by the US defence contractor Raytheon, the Patriot is in service with the US and allied countries including Germany, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Poland, Sweden, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Romania, Spain, and Taiwan.

Dutch PM to meet China's Xi as chip export policy strains ties,"The Dutch prime minister will travel to Beijing next week for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on ""economic ties"", the Dutch government said on Friday, a meeting likely to be strained over computer chip export policy matters. The Dutch government this year began denying licences for ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, to export many of its products to China, following pressure from the United States.
ASML dominates the global market for lithography systems, multi-million dollar tools essential in helping to create the circuitry of computer chips. One of Xi's top policy goals has been to help China build up its domestic chipmaking industry, spending billions on subsidies.
Meanwhile the U.S. government is seeking to undermine China's ability to make its own chips, and has enlisted aid from the Dutch and Japanese governments in restricting equipment exports. Under rules in place since Jan. 1, ASML has said it no longer expects to receive licences from the Dutch government to ship its more advanced ""DUV"" tool lines to Chinese customers.
But it remains unclear how much of the equipment ASML has already sold to Chinese customers it will be able to continue to service. It sold gear worth more than 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) to Chinese chipmakers in 2023, making China ASML's second-largest market behind Taiwan and ahead of South Korea.
Without spare parts, ASML's machines are expected to become impossible to operate within weeks. During the March 26-27 visit, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to meet with Xi and premier Li Qiang, while Dutch Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen is also attending and expected to meet with Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao.
""They will discuss economic cooperation opportunities, the importance of a level playing field, and the importance of equal market access,"" the Dutch government said in a statement. ($1 = 0.9244 euros)

North Korea-Japan World Cup qualifier off,"North Korea’s home World Cup qualifier against Japan was called off on Friday, the Asian Football Confederation said, hours after announcing it would be moved to a neutral venue.
“The fixture between DPR Korea and Japan, scheduled to be played on March 26, will not take place as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances,” the AFC said in a statement.

It said the decision was taken after talks with world football governing body FIFA and came a day after North Korea said it would not be able to stage the game in the capital Pyongyang.

North Korean officials did not say why.
The AFC said the matter would now be referred to “the relevant committees” in FIFA with further updates expected.
It did not confirm if the fixture would be played at a future time or place.
Earlier Friday, AFC general secretary Windsor John told AFP the game would proceed, but at a neutral venue.
The match in Pyongyang would have been the first game in North Korea for Japan’s men’s team since 2011 and a rare international football match in isolated North Korea.

Japan and North Korea’s women’s playoff for the Paris Olympics was switched from Pyongyang to neutral ground in Saudi Arabia last month.
READ: North Korea scores big win over South Korea in Asian Games football
Japanese news agency Kyodo reported on Thursday that North Korea didn’t want to host the match over fears of bacterial infections in Japan.
North Korean officials the same day told their Japanese counterparts that they could not play host, without saying why.
“They asked us during half-time if we can organize (it) in Japan,” Japan football association chief Kozo Tashima said after the teams met in a first qualifier in Tokyo, which the hosts won 1-0.
“I told them it was so sudden and that I cannot give them an immediate yes,” Japanese media quoted Tashima as saying.
“I told them it will take us at least two or three days (to answer). I told them it’s difficult,” he said.
Earlier this week Japan’s foreign ministry warned football fans not to attempt to travel to the country for the match.
“As you know, North Korea takes a hostile view of Japan and travel is not recommended for the general public,” it said on X, formerly Twitter.
Fourteen government officials had been set to accompany the Japan team for the match as well as a small number of media outlets, broadcaster NHK reported.
Relations have long been dogged by issues including compensation for Japan’s brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and more recently by Pyongyang’s firing of missiles over Japanese territory.
The abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s — forced to train spies in Japanese language and customs — has also long been a major point of contention.
Despite being isolated and poor, North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup.
But they were knocked out at the group stage following three defeats, including a 7-0 thumping by Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.

North Korea cancels World Cup qualifier against Japan,"North Korea has abruptly cancelled its 2026 World Cup qualifying match with Japan next week, leaving organisers frantically searching for an alternative venue.
North Korea reportedly decided it would no longer host the match, which had been scheduled for next Tuesday at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang, a day before the teams met in Tokyo on Thursday in the first of their two Asian qualifying Group B qualifiers.
Minutes after that game, which Japan won 1-0, Kozo Tashima, the president of the Japan Football Association, told reporters that the return match in the North Korean capital would not go ahead.
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said the match had been called off due to “unforeseen circumstances”.
“The decision, taken in consultation with Fifa and relevant stakeholders, comes after the AFC was informed on 20 March by the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] Football Association of the need to move the match to a neutral venue due to unavoidable circumstances,” it said in a statement on Friday.
The AFC did not give a reason for the cancellation and said it would be left to the relevant Fifa committees to decide on the fixture’s future.
The Nikkei Asia website said the match had been moved to a yet unannounced neutral venue, while no date has been given for the fixture.
The Kyodo news agency cited unspecified North Korean media reports about a “malignant infectious disease” in Japan, thought to be a reference to a potentially deadly form of group A streptococcal disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
Experts in Japan have said cases of STSS will continue to spread, while officials are struggling to identify the cause. The number of cases in 2024 is expected to exceed last year’s record number after the presence of highly virulent and infectious strains were confirmed in Japan.
Japan’s players and staff had planned to arrive in Pyongyang on Monday after training in Beijing, media reports said.
Last month, a qualifying match for the Paris Olympics between the Japanese and North Korean women’s teams was moved from Pyongyang to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at the last minute after Japanese football authorities cited difficulties in travelling to North Korea, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Japan.
The return leg of the men’s World Cup qualifier would have been the first international sports event to be held in North Korea since before the coronavirus pandemic. The regime responded to the outbreak by sealing its borders and banning foreign tourists.
North Korea last hosted a men’s soccer international in Pyongyang in 2019 during the qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup. The country later pulled out of that competition, citing health concerns related to the pandemic.
North Korea is also scheduled to host World Cup qualifiers against Group B’s other two teams, Syria and Myanmar, in June.",2024-03-22T11:44:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

SEOUL, March 22 (UPI) -- North Korea canceled plans to host a scheduled World Cup qualifying match against Japan next week, Asia's governing soccer association confirmed Friday, leaving organizers scrambling to find a neutral venue with just days to spare. The two sides played the first leg of back-to-back qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Thursday in Tokyo, which Japan won 1-0. However, North Korean officials abruptly notified their Japanese counterparts and the Asian Football Confederation that they were not going to host the follow-up in Pyongyang, which had been scheduled for Tuesday.

The match ""will not take place as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances,"" the Asian Football Confederation said Friday in a statement.
""The decision, taken in consultation with FIFA and relevant stakeholders, comes after the AFC was informed on March 20 by the DPR Korea Football Association of the need to move the match to a neutral venue due to unavoidable circumstances,"" the statement said.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
No further information on a venue was given. UPI has reached out to the AFC for comment.

Japan Football Association President Kozo Tashima told local media Thursday that he had received a message from North Korean officials earlier that day saying they were withdrawing because it would be ""difficult"" to host the contest in Pyongyang.
Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that North Korea is believed to have pulled out due to the outbreak of a lethal streptococcus infection in Japan, citing an article Thursday in the North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper on a ""malignant infectious disease"" in the country.
In a separate article on the same day, the newspaper also reported on a ""highly contagious measles outbreak"" in Japan.
North Korea sealed its borders at the very outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020 and only slowly began allowing cross-border traffic with China to resume in August 2023.
The Pyongyang match would have been the first international soccer contest held in North Korea since 2019, when it hosted a qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup.
Last week, Japan's Foreign Ministry said it would send 14 officials to support the team and Japanese media members in North Korea, as the countries do not have diplomatic relations. However, the ministry advised fans to refrain from traveling to Pyongyang for the match.

North Korea is still scheduled to hold home qualifiers against Syria and Myanmar in June.
The cancellation comes after an Olympic soccer qualifier between the Japanese and North Korean women's teams was also relocated from Pyongyang last month.
The Japan Football Association requested the move to a neutral venue, citing a lack of flights for its fans and delays in working with the North Korean hosts. The match was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
The Japanese men's team is ranked number 18 in the world by FIFA, while North Korea is farther down the list at 114. North Korea has participated in the World Cup twice, in 1966 and 2010.",2024-03-22T10:13:25Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
"Who is Ippei Mizuhara, Shohei Ohtani's interpreter?","SEOUL, South Korea — Japanese interpreter Ippei Mizuhara has been fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after allegations he stole money from baseball star Shohei Ohtani to service illegal gambling debts. He and his alleged bookmaker are also under investigation by the IRS.
But who is Mizuhara and how did he get in a position to carry out the alleged theft from his close friend?
ADVERTISEMENT
The 39-year-old Mizuhara is a familiar face to baseball fans as Ohtani’s companion, having interpreted for the star with mainly media since Ohtani moved to the United States in 2017.
READ: Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter fired after allegations of ‘massive theft’
Mizuhara even served as Ohtani’s catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. When Ohtani left the Los Angeles Angels for a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in December, the club also hired Mizuhara.
Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to the Los Angeles area in 1991 so his father could work as a chef. He attended Diamond Bar High School in eastern Los Angeles County and graduated from the University of California, Riverside, in 2007.
After college, Mizuhara was hired by the Boston Red Sox as an interpreter for Japanese pitcher Hideki Okajima. He returned to Japan in 2013 to translate for English-speaking players on the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. That’s where he first met Ohtani, who joined the team that same year.

After Ohtani signed with the Angels in 2017, the team hired Mizuhara to work as his personal interpreter, and he followed the player when he joined the Dodgers.

Mizuhara was in the Dodgers’ dugout on Wednesday during its season-opening win over San Diego in Seoul.
Ohtani made his Dodgers debut in the game but it has been overshadowed by reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about Mizuhara’s alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker.
Law firm Berk Brettler LLP followed up Wednesday by saying, “Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft.”
Sports gambling is illegal in California, even as 38 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of it.
Mizuhara told ESPN on Tuesday night he gambled on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football, but said he never bet on baseball, which is prohibited among team employees under MLB rules.
Mizuhara said he incurred more than $1 million in debt by the end of 2022 and his losses increased from there. He told ESPN that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at his request.
But Ohtani’s attorneys then released a statement saying the player was a victim of theft, and ESPN says Mizuhara changed his story Wednesday to say Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.
The Associated Press was unable reach Mizuhara for comment. It was not clear if he had hired an attorney.

Top South Korean university to penalise school bullies in admission exams,"Students with a history of bullying will be penalised during entrance exams at the prestigious Korea University from 2025, in a bid to clamp down on the rise in school bullying in South Korea.
The university’s president Kim Dong-won said on March 21 that such students will face a deduction of up to 20 points in the entrance exam, Seoul Economic Daily reported.
The school’s academic affairs committee will deduct a maximum of 20 points from the scores of applicants who were expelled or had a forced transfer due to bullying, Yonhap News Agency said.
The university is one of South Korea’s top three prestigious schools, which also include Seoul National University and Yonsei University.
Speaking at a press conference, Mr Kim said that applicants who have been disciplined for school violence do not match the university’s ideals of “altruism, leadership and community”.
“Currently, even a 0.1-point difference can affect the outcome (of an admission), so a deduction of 20 points would practically make admission impossible,” he said.
The percentage of Seoul students who said they had been targeted by a bully – or iljin in Korean – hit a high in the past 10 years, according to a 2023 Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education (Smoe) study.
The survey of 486,729 students, between the fourth grade of elementary school and the final year of high school, found that 2.2 per cent had experienced some form of mistreatment at school. The figure increased by 2 per cent compared with 2022, and marked a 10-year high.
Verbal abuse was the most common form of school violence, followed by physical abuse and bullying.
Smoe attributed the rise in cases to students’ return to in-person classes after years of online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic.
An official said students had fewer chances to interact with their friends during the pandemic and Smoe believed this led to the higher tendency of violence towards students having more difficulty addressing conflicts.
To combat the growing cases, measures like having students’ bullying records reflected in the college admissions process from the 2026 academic year were rolled out in 2023.
The South Korean government has also considered extending the bullying record retention period so that the black mark will follow the perpetrators when they apply for jobs.
In recent years, some celebrities have also been embroiled in bullying scandals.
For example, in 2021, actor Ji Soo was dropped from an ongoing drama after admitting to being a bully and “sex predator” in school.
That same year, K-pop singer Garam had to leave the five-member girl group Le Sserafim after being accused of bullying in middle school.
Volleyball stars Lee Jae-yeong and Lee Da-yeong were also banned by the national team in 2021 after it was confirmed that the twin sisters had bullied their teammates in middle school.
The school bullying phenomenon has been turned into the hit Netflix drama series The Glory, which tells the story of a woman who plans to seek revenge on her high school bullies after 17 years.
The series’ director Ahn Gil-ho was later accused of bullying and admitted to having physically assaulted younger students when he was in high school.",2024-03-22T05:40:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante,"Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-22T04:16:00Z,https://www.merkur.de,merkur.de
1MILLION Dance Studio brings K-dance moves to MFA Late Nites,"The group, which boasts more than 26 million subscribers on YouTube , brought members Debby, Lia Kim, Harimu, Amy, and Dohee to Boston this week for the launch of “Hallyu! The Korean Wave,” a new exhibit on Korean art, history, and pop culture that opens to the public at the Museum of Fine Arts on Sunday. 1MILLION Dance Studio was tapped to perform at Friday night’s MFA Late Nites celebration, which is expected to attract thousands of visitors eager for an early look at the exhibit. Presented by CJ ENM, the festivities will also include performances by fellow Seoul-based acts Ailee and HYPNOSIS THERAPY.
Korean pop culture has become a powerful force on the global stage. K-pop stars like BTS and Blackpink have sold out arenas around the world, while Korean films and TV shows like “Parasite” and “Squid Game” have become Hollywood award-season darlings. And now, 1MILLION Dance Studio, Korea’s leading dance agency, wants to take K-dance to the same heights.

Starting out in a basement in 2014, 1MILLION Dance Studio has evolved into Korea’s top agency for dancers and choreographers. The group earned global acclaim after participating in the South Korean dance competition “Street Woman Fighter2″ in 2023, and have amassed a huge social media following thanks to their dance videos and constantly updated content stream.
1MILLION cofounder Lia Kim believes that the rapid embrace of Korean culture in recent years is due to a few factors, most notably social media’s role in connecting Korean artists with global audiences. She also noted how Korean society tends to be receptive of new cultures and styles, while maintaining deep traditional roots, enabling them to put their own spin on what’s trending.
“Koreans are very sensitive to trends,” she told the Globe through an interpreter following the group’s tour of the MFA exhibit on Thursday. “They accept new trends really fast and then digest it and interpret it in a new way.”

The group’s growing fan base has attracted visitors from across the world to their studio in Seoul, with budding dancers hoping to learn from the social media stars.
“There are a lot of people from different nationalities [that] come to see 1MILLION,” group member Dohee said. “1MILLION Studio is itself an attraction now.”
When it comes to the exhibit, 1MILLION’s Harimu was particularly drawn to its interactive dance challenge display, where visitors can boogie down and have their moves displayed on a big screen, comparing it to their dance classes.
1MILLION’s Amy appreciated how the exhibit explores the history of Korea and its impact on pop culture, including Gangnam style (yes, the song, but also the cultural region in Seoul), which felt both “refreshing” and “very familiar” to see.
Looking toward the future, Lia Kim said 1MILLION Dance Studio plans to expand with studios, camps, and workshops outside of Korea. She notes that, just like the K-pop stars who became global phenomenons, she wants to see K-dancers find the same success and “have more influence overseas, as well.”

Why are striking doctors in South Korea facing license suspensions and what's next?,"South Korea is poised to start suspending the licenses of thousands of striking junior doctors as a punitive measure against their weekslong walkouts that have shaken hospital operations.
Starting next week, the government said it will inform the striking medical interns and residents of its final decision to suspend their licenses for missing a government-imposed February 29 deadline to return to work.
It's still unclear whether the move will prompt the doctors to end their strikes, and the standoff could still deepen as some senior doctors plan to submit resignations on Monday in a show of solidarity with the junior strikers.
Here are the latest developments on the strikes touched off by the government's announcement in early February that it would recruit 2,000 more medical students yearly.
WHY ARE THEIR LICENSES BEING SUSPENDED? Since early March, the South Korean government has been taking a series of administrative steps to suspend the licenses of about 12,000 junior doctors. The steps include informing the strikers about possible suspensions and giving them opportunities to respond.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo said on Tuesday the government is expected to finish those administrative steps for some of the strikers next week and that it will send them final government notices about their impending license suspensions.
Each notice would contain details including when a license suspension will take effect and how long it will last. By law, they must be delivered in person or by mail. But for those whose addresses are unknown, the suspensions would take effect after related information is posted on the government website, according to the Health Ministry.
Health officials have said each striking doctor could face a minimum three-month license suspension and possible indictment by prosecutors. The country's medical law allows punishments of medical personnel if they refuse government orders to resume work.
Park repeated his appeal for doctors to report back to work, suggesting those who return would face unspecified softer punishments. He previously warned that junior doctors with suspension records could face delays in getting licenses for specialists or trouble in finding jobs.
WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS FOR WALKOUTS? Despite the suspensions, striking doctors won't likely back down anytime soon as they have already ignored repeated warnings they must return to work or face prosecution.
Some observers have questioned whether the government could suspend all the striking doctors, who represent more than 90 per cent of the country's 13,000 interns and resident doctors. They said the government would likely target strike leaders and that they would likely respond with legal action.
Further complicating the situation, senior doctors at major university hospitals — where most of the striking doctors trained — are threatening to submit resignations en masse early next week. They plan to continue their work for the time being, but if they walk off the job like the junior doctors, that would cause a much bigger strain on South Korea's medical services, observers say.
The government urged senior doctors to cancel those plans. It recently sent notices to two senior doctors who lead an emergency committee for the walkouts, telling them their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors' strikes.
One of the two doctors, Park Myung-Ha, accused the government of attempting to break up the emergency committee and sending a warning message to the striking junior doctors.
The government on Wednesday announced detailed plans for how to allocate the additional 2,000 admission seats to medical schools, indicating that the government has no intention of revising its plans. The doctors' emergency committee said in a statement Thursday that the striking doctors ""can't repress our astonishment and anger"".
WHAT IS AT THE CENTER OF THE DISPUTE? At the heart of the confrontation is a government plan to increase the country's medical school enrolment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058, which has been unchanged since 2006.
The government says it needs to add up to 10,000 doctors by 2035 because the country has one of the world's fastest-aging populations and its doctors-to-population ratio is among the lowest among advanced economies. Officials say more doctors are needed to address a long-running shortage of physicians in low-paying but key essential professions like pediatrics and emergency departments.
But doctors say universities can't offer quality education to such an abruptly increased number of students and that it would ultimately hurt the quality of South Korea's medical services. They say doctors in greater competition would likely engage in overtreatment and that newly recruited students would also likely want to work in high-paying, popular professions like plastic surgery and dermatology.
The doctors' protests haven't generated public support, with a recent survey showing that about 90 per cent of respondents support an increase in the medical school admission cap. Some critics say the striking doctors worry that adding more doctors would result in lower incomes in the future.
The striking doctors account for less than 10 per cent of the country's 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent 30-40 per cent of the total doctors and assist senior doctors and deal with inpatients. Their walkouts have subsequently led to hundreds of cancelled or postponed surgeries and other treatments.

"Soccer-North Korea won't host World Cup qualifier against Japan, Kyodo reports","North Korea will not host a World Cup qualifier with Japan that was scheduled to be held in Pyongyang next week, Kyodo news agency reported late Thursday, citing the president of the Japan Football Association (JFA).
""A game will not be played in Pyongyang,"" Kyodo quoted Kozo Tashima as saying after Japan beat North Korea 1-0 in another qualifier in Tokyo on Thursday. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) informed the JFA this month that the match between the two nations would be held on March 26 in Pyongyang, the report said.
North Korea, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Tokyo, appears to have decided not to stage the match in its capital over worries about infectious diseases in Japan, Kyodo said. It has not been decided whether the match will be held on the scheduled date or where it will take place, according to Kyodo.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the government was not in a position to comment as FIFA and AFC would make the decision. There was no immediate response to a request for clarification from the AFC. JFA was not immediately available for comment either.
The Samurai Blue squad has cancelled a flight to Beijing originally scheduled for Friday morning and plan to train in Chiba prefecture, the JFA said. North Korea last hosted a men's soccer international in Pyongyang in 2019 during the qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup. The country pulled out of that competition citing health concerns related to the COVID pandemic.
The North Koreans are also scheduled to stage home qualifiers against Syria and Myanmar in June. In February, an Olympic qualifier between the women's teams of the two countries scheduled for Pyongyang was switched at the last minute to a neutral venue in Saudi Arabia.
There was similar confusion over that match, with the Japan team departing for Jeddah four days before the scheduled kickoff without any confirmation of where the match would be played.

Pair of pups land at LAX after rescue from South Korea meat trade,"Pair of pups land at LAX after rescue from South Korea meat trade
LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A pair of dogs rescued from the South Korea meat trade have arrived in Los Angeles.
One of the adorable pups, Danny, is not only a rare breed who was rescued from a kill shelter but also managed to escape a fire at the rescue center that killed 20 other dogs.
According to the organization that flew him to Los Angeles: ""Danny is one of only 600 Donggyeong dogs in the world. The endangered breed has a natural bob tail and is considered a national treasure in South Korea. Rescuers pulled Danny from the same shelter before he could be killed for lack of space or taken by a dog meat buyer. Soon after, Danny managed to escape the Jindo Love Rescue center as it burned down, killing 20 dogs.""
Danny and Yoshi, a shiba inu, met their new adoptive parents at Los Angeles International Airport.
""I would say to people, if you have the means, if you have the want, if you have space in your heart, open your home, open your life, adopt a dog,"" said Deidra Cooper, who adopted Yoshi.
Earlier this year, South Korea's parliament passed a law banning the sale and distribution of dog meat. But it is being phased in over three years, so rescue organizations are still working to get more dogs adopted during the law's transition period.",2024-03-22T00:40:46Z,https://abc7.com,KABC-TV
"Japan Beats North Korea In World Cup Qualifying Then North Korea Cancels Visit By Japan, Media Says","TOKYO: North Korea reportedly canceled hosting Japan in a World Cup qualifier just hours after losing to Japan in Tokyo on Thursday.
Japan scored after just 90 seconds and held out North Korea to win 1-0 and maintain its perfect start in the second round of Asian qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.
Soon after, Japan Football Association chief Kozo Tashima told Kyodo News that North Korea canceled the scheduled qualifier against Japan on Tuesday in Pyongyang, giving the news in a letter to the Asian Football Confederation.
North Korea was concerned by “a malignant infectious disease” in Japan, an apparent reference to rising cases of streptococcus infections, Kyodo said.
Ao Tanaka’s strike at the National Stadium gave host Japan three wins from three Group B games.
The midfielder fired home from inside a crowded penalty area after a Ritsu Doan pullback.
North Korea, cheered on by a small pocket of red-shirted fans, lacked attacking power to get back in the game. North Korea has only three points from the first three group games.
“We wanted to give our fans a good result and we are sorry we could not but it was a good game,” North Korea coach Sin Yong Nam said.
South Korea was held by Thailand to 1-1 in Seoul in its first game since Jurgen Klinsmann was fired as the coach in February.
Son Heung-min put South Korea ahead after 42 minutes with a shot from close range. Just after an hour, Suphanat Mueanta leveled.
“There’s no getting around the fact that it was a disappointing result but there were positives to take from the game,” Son said.
Despite the draw, South Korea remained on top of Group C ahead of Tuesday’s game in Bangkok, three points above Thailand and China, which drew 2-2 with Singapore.
Australia has won all three of its Group I games after defeating Lebanon 2-0 in Sydney.
Keanu Baccus opened the scoring after just five minutes and Kye Rowles added the second shortly after the restart.
Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all maintained their perfect records with respective wins over the Philippines, Tajikistan and Yemen.
In Jordan’s first action since losing the Asian Cup final to Qatar in February, it beat Pakistan 3-0. Qatar defeated Kuwait by the same scoreline.
The top two teams from each of the nine groups will advance to the final round. Asia’s automatic allocation at the World Cup has increased from four to eight.

"In Japan, Ohtani's 'perfect person' image could take a hit with firing of interpreter over gambling","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is referred to in Japan as “kanpeki no hito” — the perfect person — because of his manners and impeccable behavior.
That image may have taken a hit when the Dodgers fired his good friend and interpreter Ippei Mizuhara on Wednesday over allegations he gambled illegally and stole Ohtani’s money to pay off debts.
The law firm representing Ohtani called it a “massive theft” in a statement.
The Seoul Series — the first MLB games in South Korea — were supposed to be a showcase for Ohtani before a fertile baseball audience in Asia. The games between San Diego and Los Angeles were scheduled before he signed a $700 million, 10-year deal with the Dodgers in December. For MLB, the stars seemed perfectly aligned and there is already talk of a similar series next year in Tokyo.
A bomb threat Wednesday briefly put a cloud over the series. Police were warned before the first game of a bomb at the stadium but found no explosives. Ohtani was reportedly the target.
Then came the other Ohtani bombshell.
“I was shocked when I read it,” said Jorge Kuri, a hardcore Dodgers fan from Tijuana, Mexico, who runs a garment business there.
Wearing a blue Dodgers sweatshirt and cap at the Gocheok Sky Dome, Kuri said he was trying to sift through the information that’s out there. He said he’d just returned from vacation in Japan “where Ohtani is king.”
“I don’t know what the end is going to be with this because I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg,” he added. ""Right now he's the image of Major League Baseball.”
Mizuhara, 39, was let go from the team following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker. He was in the dugout and with the team through Wednesday's game — the shocking reports dropped Wednesday evening in the U.S., while most fans in Asia were asleep.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts confirmed Mizuhara had a meeting with the team Wednesday but declined to elaborate. He said he did not know Mizuhara’s whereabouts and said a different interpreter would be used.
“Anything with that meeting, I can’t comment,” Roberts said, adding that “Shohei’s ready. I know that he’s preparing.”
Ohtani didn’t practice on the field before Thursday's game. In his absence, his face appeared on the video board promoting a line of Japanese cosmetics.
He seemed unfazed hours later in his first at-bat as he lined a single to right field. In two other at-bats he hit towering drives to right just a few feet short of a home run.
Mizuhara is likely to be investigated by U.S. authorities and MLB, and the whole story is a stunning turn for the man who has been inseparable from Ohtani since the two-way star came to the U.S in 2017. He told ESPN this week that Ohtani knew nothing of his illegal wagers on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.
As Mizuhara told it, Ohtani was an innocent victim to his close friend's gambling addiction.
As long as Ohtani isn’t directly accused of illegal betting, the allegations won’t meaningfully hurt his carefully crafted public image, said Lee Seung-yun, a marketing professor at Seoul’s Konkuk University.
“Ohtani’s image is like clean, white porcelain, and that could make a speck look bigger than it is,” he said. “Information spreads at amazing speeds these days, narratives are made before the truth of the facts are figured out, and if Ohtani was seen as a questionable character, the allegations would have really hurt him.""
“But his image is so strong and impeccable, and as long as he wasn’t directly involved, the allegations may just end up a blip,” Lee added.
Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Seoul’s Hanyang University, said Ohtani’s image to global fans, including South Koreans, was that of a mysterious monk who “fully devoted himself into a religion called baseball.”
He said the allegations facing Mizuhara so far only may only strengthen that impression of Ohtani — a person who’s driven by perfection in baseball but more naïve and simple-hearted with other things.
“It’s a problem you often see with athletes — putting too much trust and depending excessively on the people they have known for long and are comfortable with and not knowing when they are taken advantage of,” Lee Jong-Sung said.
“It’s not all about you being perfect. Ohtani and the Dodgers should have better judgment in picking the people he works with,"" he added.

The games between San Diego and Los Angeles were scheduled before he signed a $700 million, 10-year deal with the Dodgers in December. For MLB, the stars seemed perfectly aligned and there is already talk of a similar series next year in Tokyo.
A bomb threat Wednesday briefly put a cloud over the series. Police were warned before the first game of a bomb at the stadium but found no explosives. Ohtani was reportedly the target.
Then came the other Ohtani bombshell.
“I was shocked when I read it,” said Jorge Kuri, a hardcore Dodgers fan from Tijuana, Mexico, who runs a garment business there.
Wearing a blue Dodgers sweatshirt and cap at the Gocheok Sky Dome, Kuri said he was trying to sift through the information that’s out there. He said he’d just returned from vacation in Japan “where Ohtani is king.”
“I don’t know what the end is going to be with this because I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg,” he added. ""Right now he's the image of Major League Baseball.”
Mizuhara, 39, was let go from the team following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker. He was in the dugout and with the team through Wednesday's game — the shocking reports dropped Wednesday evening in the U.S., while most fans in Asia were asleep.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts confirmed Mizuhara had a meeting with the team Wednesday but declined to elaborate. He said he did not know Mizuhara’s whereabouts and said a different interpreter would be used.
“Anything with that meeting, I can’t comment,” Roberts said, adding that “Shohei’s ready. I know that he’s preparing.”
Ohtani didn’t practice on the field before Thursday's game. In his absence, his face appeared on the video board promoting a line of Japanese cosmetics.
He seemed unfazed hours later in his first at-bat as he lined a single to right field. In two other at-bats he hit towering drives to right just a few feet short of a home run.
Mizuhara is likely to be investigated by U.S. authorities and MLB, and the whole story is a stunning turn for the man who has been inseparable from Ohtani since the two-way star came to the U.S in 2017. He told ESPN this week that Ohtani knew nothing of his illegal wagers on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.
As Mizuhara told it, Ohtani was an innocent victim to his close friend's gambling addiction.
As long as Ohtani isn’t directly accused of illegal betting, the allegations won’t meaningfully hurt his carefully crafted public image, said Lee Seung-yun, a marketing professor at Seoul’s Konkuk University.
“Ohtani’s image is like clean, white porcelain, and that could make a speck look bigger than it is,” he said. “Information spreads at amazing speeds these days, narratives are made before the truth of the facts are figured out, and if Ohtani was seen as a questionable character, the allegations would have really hurt him.""
“But his image is so strong and impeccable, and as long as he wasn’t directly involved, the allegations may just end up a blip,” Lee added.
Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Seoul’s Hanyang University, said Ohtani’s image to global fans, including South Koreans, was that of a mysterious monk who “fully devoted himself into a religion called baseball.”
He said the allegations facing Mizuhara so far only may only strengthen that impression of Ohtani — a person who’s driven by perfection in baseball but more naïve and simple-hearted with other things.
“It’s a problem you often see with athletes — putting too much trust and depending excessively on the people they have known for long and are comfortable with and not knowing when they are taken advantage of,” Lee Jong-Sung said.
“It’s not all about you being perfect. Ohtani and the Dodgers should have better judgment in picking the people he works with,"" he added.

"In Japan, Ohtani's 'perfect person' image could take a hit with firing of interpreter over gambling","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is referred to in Japan as “kanpeki no hito” — the perfect person — because of his manners and impeccable behavior.

Padres outlast Dodgers in 15-11 slugfest for split in Korea,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Yoshinobu Yamamoto was chased after one inning of a nightmarish major league debut and the San Diego Padres outlasted the Dodgers 15-11 on Thursday night after Los Angeles fired Shohei Ohtani's interpreter following allegations of illegal gambling.
Mookie Betts had four hits and six RBIs for the Dodgers, including the first home run of the major league season.
Jake Cronenworth tied a career high with four hits and had four RBIs for San Diego, which gained a split in the opening two-games series, Major League Baseball's first games in South Korea. After the Dodgers rebounded from a 9-2 deficit and closed to 12-11, Manny Machado hit a three-run homer in the ninth off J.P. Feyereisen.
San Diego outhit the Dodgers 17-16. Luis Campusano had three hits and 20-year-old center fielder Jackson Merrill got his first two major league hits.
Ohtani hit three deep flyouts on a 1-for-5 night and was 3 for 10 with one RBI in the series. Interpreter Ippei Mizuhara was let go from the team Wednesday following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker.
Los Angeles made three errors that led to a pair of unearned runs.
Yamamoto (0-1) signed a $325 million, 12-year contract, a record amount for a pitcher that created high expectations. San Diego batted around against the two-time Pacific League MVP, and he left with a 45.00 ERA, allowing five runs, four hits, one walk, a hit batter and a wild pitch.
Cronenworth's two-run triple, Ha-Seong Kim's sacrifice fly, Campusano's RBI double and Tyler Wade's run-scoring single built a 5-1 lead. Xander Bogaerts hit a two-run single in a four-run third off Michael Grove.
Michael King (1-0) won in his Padres debut following his acquisition in the trade that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees. King allowed three runs in 3 1/3 innings.
Robert Suarez got four outs for the save.
Padres starter Joe Musgrove gave up five runs, seven hits and two walks in 2 2/3 innings.
Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy allowed Campusano’s first-inning bouncer to get under his glove and down the line for an RBI double, had Fernando Tatis Jr.’s third-inning grounder kick off his glove into left for an error as a run scored, then allowed José Azocar’s seventh-inning grounder to bounce off his glove for a run-scoring error. Muncy hit an inning-ending popup that stranded two runners in the eighth.
In the second season of the pitch clock, the game took 3 hours, 42 minutes, a day after the opener lasted 3:05. Bogaerts struck out for the final out in the eighth when a pitch clock-violation was called by plate umpire Andy Fletcher with a 1-2 count.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Bogaerts jammed the ring finger of his left hand while sliding into second base when tagging up in the seventh.
UP NEXT
Dodgers: They host the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday and Monday, then play at Anaheim on Tuesday in the annual exhibition Freeway Series. They resume the season March 28 in their home opener against St. Louis.
Padres: They are home against Seattle in exhibitions at Petco Park on Monday and Tuesday, then resume the season hosting San Francisco in a four-game series starting March 28.

Padres top Dodgers in 15-11 slugfest for split in Korea,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — After chasing Yoshinobu Yamamoto from his major league debut after one inning and scoring their most runs ever against the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego's Xander Bogaerts was sad to leave the Gocheok Sky Dome.
""We got to come here more,"" he said
Jake Cronenworth tied a career high with four hits and had four RBIs as the Padres outlasted the Dodgers 15-11 on Thursday night after Los Angeles fired Shohei Ohtani's interpreter following allegations of illegal gambling.
Interpreter Ippei Mizuhara was let go from the team Wednesday following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker.
Ohtani hit three deep flyouts on a 1-for-5 night, including a sacrifice fly, and was 3 for 10 with two RBIs in the series. He did not speak with reporters.
""I hope Sho is good, but you know, at the end of the day we have to make sure we take care of our jobs,"" said Mookie Betts, who had six RBIs along with four hits that included the first home run of the major league season. ""No matter what cards we're dealt, we better go play them.""
Yamamoto and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts insisted Mizuhara's situation didn't contribute to the defeat.
""I feel regret that I just couldn't keep the team in the game from the get-go, so I do feel the responsibility for it,"" Yamamoto said through a translator. ""I just got to get ready for the next outing.""
San Diego gained a split in the opening two-games series, Major League Baseball's first games in South Korea. After the Dodgers rebounded from a 9-2 deficit and closed to 12-11, Manny Machado hit a three-run homer in the ninth off J.P. Feyereisen.

""Just didn't have the command and so it's not about the stuff,"" Roberts said. ""When you're a command guy, which he's been his entire career, his life, and you just misfire, get behind in counts, hit batters, that's just not who he is. ... He's an easy guy that you know he'll bounce back from this.""
Bogaerts hit a two-run single in a four-run third off Michael Grove.
Michael King (1-0) won in his Padres debut following his acquisition in the trade that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees. King allowed three runs in 3 1/3 innings.
Robert Suarez got four outs for the save after 26-year-old right-hander Stephen Kolek made his major league debut, getting charged with two runs in the eighth.
Padres starter Joe Musgrove gave up five runs, seven hits and two walks in 2 2/3 innings.

"What we learned from Dodgers vs. Padres in Korea: Bad debut for MLB's top-paid pitcher, sloppy defense, more","The San Diego Padres defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 15-11 on Thursday morning (box score), splitting Major League Baseball's season-opening two-game series in Seoul, South Korea. In between the games, an off-the-field scandal took over the headlines when Shohei Ohtani's interpreter was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the Dodgers superstar to pay gambling debts.
The Padres and Dodgers will now return stateside and resume their seasons on Opening Day (March 28) with 1-1 records.
Since both games started in the early morning on the east coast, we here at CBS Sports felt it would be helpful to our audience to provide a handful of takeaways from the Seoul Series.
Below, then, you'll find five talking points to catch you up on matters.
1. Yamamoto struggles in MLB debut
It's fair to write that Thursday's outing is not what the Dodgers had in mind when they signed right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto to a 12-year pact worth $325 million.
Yamamoto, who authored a brilliant career in Japan, uncharacteristically suffered through command woes on Thursday morning. In turn, he allowed five runs on four hits, a walk, and a hit batsman. (He struck out a pair of batters as well.) According to the research of Eric Stephen of SB Nation, Yamamoto's five runs surrendered in an inning of work represented the most by a debuting Dodgers starter in club history.
There's no sense making too much of Thursday's outing, especially since the most likely explanation -- besides it being a single game -- is that Yamamoto is still in the process of adjusting to the differences between MLB and Nippon Professional Baseball. Those include the pitch clock, a clustered schedule, and a different ball -- one that provides a worse natural grip, if pitchers who have used both are to be trusted.
In other words, it's worth giving Yamamoto more time to adapt.
2. Ohtani appears unbothered by controversy
You may have heard by now that Shohei Ohtani's long-time interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired following Wednesday's game amid theft and illegal gambling allegations. Mizuhara was replaced on Thursday by Will Ireton, formerly Kenta Maeda's interpreter during his time in Los Angeles, according to Fabian Ardaya of The Athletic.
Despite that change, and despite the at-times head-swirling nature of the 24-hour news cycle, Ohtani showed no signs of being distracted on Thursday.
Rather, Ohtani went 1 for 5 with an RBI and nearly delivered both his first home run of the season and his first home run as a member of the Dodgers organization. Alas, the ball fell short of the bleachers, leaving Ohtani to collect a sacrifice fly for his troubles.
3. Merrill records first knocks
Yamamoto wasn't the only player to make his first MLB appearance during this series. Jackson Merrill, a converted infielder now starting in center for the Padres, also checked off some firsts in Seoul. On Thursday, he notched both his first career MLB hit and his first career MLB extra-base hit. Here's the latter:
Merrill was ranked by CBS Sports this spring as the 12th-best prospect in the minors. Here's part of our writeup: ""Merrill connected on more than 80% of his swings last season, resulting in a cumulative .277/.326/.444 slash line across High- and Double-A. His ability to put the bat on the ball is his top selling point. He does have some power, but it's almost exclusively to his pull side.""
4. Betts delivers season's first home run
Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts launched the first home run of the season in the fifth inning when he took advantage of a 3-1 fastball from Padres righty Michael King. Betts' home run reduced the Padres' lead to two. Furthermore, it guarantees that he'll be able to reduce something else -- his share of emissions -- since he won an electric car from Hyundai as part of the South Korean automobile manufacturer's promotional stunt.
Here's a look at that sweet, sweet car-winning home run:
Betts has established new career highs in home runs in each of the past two seasons, including 39 in 2023. We'll see if he can complete the hat trick this year.
5. Gloves did not make trip
There are valid reasons for both teams playing sloppy defense during this two-game set, so we're not here to judge when we write that it wasn't the most crisp series with the leather. The Padres were charged with a pair of errors on Wednesday, and the Dodgers returned volley by committing several of their own on Thursday, with third baseman Max Muncy having a particularly rough go of things.
Of course, the defensive play that everyone will remember from this series occurred on Wednesday, when Padres first baseman Jake Cronenworth had a ball shoot through his glove:
That'll do it for MLB's regular season -- well, at least until March 28.",2024-03-21T13:49:46Z,https://www.cbssports.com,CBS Sports
Breakaway parties threaten to disrupt South Korea’s two-party system - can they also end parliamentary gridlock?,"Contemporary South Korean politics has traditionally been dominated by just two main parties – in common with many other countries with strong presidential systems. But that could soon change.
Recent voter discontent is creating opportunities for smaller political parties in the upcoming parliamentary election on April 10, 2024.
Heading into that vote, the two main parties – President Yoon Suk Yeol’s People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party – between them hold 270 seats in the 300-member parliament. But both parties are grappling with internal struggles and political controversies that are fueling the prospect of new, breakaway parties making gains.
The result could be a multi-party legislature. As a political scientist with a focus on East Asia and international affairs, I believe that outcome has the potential of transforming the country’s domestic and international agenda.
Parliamentary gridlock
Polling suggests that South Koreans haven’t been happy with the performance of their politicians for years, with one 2022 survey putting trust in the national assembly at just 24%. Events since then are unlikely to have improved confidence in either main party.
Since Yoon being elected president in 2022, his legislative agenda has been met with resistance by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. His plans for reforming the country’s education, pension and labor systems have stalled as a result.
Meanwhile, Yoon has vetoed multiple bills passed by the National Assembly, such as the “yellow envelope” law, which limits companies’ lawsuits for damage claims over labor union disputes, and legislation calling for special probes into the crowd crush inside Seoul’s Itaewon district during Halloween weekend in 2022 that resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries.
On foreign policy, the opposition Democratic Party has faulted the Yoon government’s pursuit of increased security ties with Japan in the face of continued bilateral tensions over Japan’s past colonial history in Korea.
Specifically, the opposition criticized a bilateral deal on compensation for the victims of forced wartime labor in Korea, and the Yoon government’s acceptance of Japan’s release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean.
Last fall, partly as protest against the president’s foreign policy and in a bid to overhaul the government’s cabinet, the National Assembly passed a nonbinding no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, though Yoon refused to dismiss his premier.
The net result of the political gridlock is that both the Yoon government and the Democratic Party face high levels of public disapproval. Yoon’s approval rating has stagnated below 40%, and the majority of voters have expressed an intention to hold his government accountable in the upcoming election by supporting opposition parties.
However, the Democratic Party has failed to capitalize on Yoon’s unpopularity, due to similar public disapproval toward the party’s leader, Lee Jae-myung.
Intraparty factions
South Korea’s two main parties have frequently experienced internal feuds among factions supportive and opposed to party leadership. In recent months, such factions opposed to both Yoon and Lee’s leadership have bolted from their respective parties.
In January 2024, Lee Jun-Seok, former People Power Party chairman, started the New Reform Party with party members who protested the pro-Yoon faction’s seemingly cliquish party leadership. This “non-Yoon” faction has also criticized the president’s veto of the special counsel bill to investigate allegations surrounding first lady Kim Geon-hee, which includes claims of violating anti-graft laws and involvement in stock price manipulation.
The Democratic Party is facing a similar challenge. Also in January 2024, Lee Nak-yon, former prime minister under the previous Democratic government of President Moon Jae-in, started the New Future Party, criticizing his former party as having turned into a “bulletproof shield” for the unpopular leader Lee Jae-myung. Specifically, the “non Jae-myung” faction have criticized him for refusing to step down despite being under criminal investigation on corruption charges.
Opportunities for breakaway parties
These new breakaway parties’ strategy is to take advantage of South Korea’s mixed-member proportional election system, which provides opportunities for smaller parties to win seats. To do so, they have been focusing efforts on building concentrated support among core groups of voters.
The New Reform Party has gained support among younger conservative male voters critical of the older generation of conservative politicians close to Yoon.
Meanwhile, the New Future Party retains some support among traditional Democratic Party members, who feel disappointed with the direction of the party. Several Democratic legislators who claimed to have been purged by the party leadership have joined Lee Nak-yon, widening the schism within the main opposition party.
Potential impact
The latest polls indicate a tight race between the People Power Party and the Democratic Party, with a 37.7% and 36.9% share of the vote, respectively. If the breakaway parties win even a small number of seats, the result could be a “hung parliament,” in which neither main party can form a single-party majority.
That would leave smaller parties with huge legislative leverage.
The New Reform Party is more likely to partner with the Yoon government on policy agendas – despite personal antipathy between Yoon and Lee Jun-Seok. On foreign policy, New Reform Party members have expressed support for pragmatic relations with Japan and have warned against excessive anti-Japan nationalist rhetoric in domestic politics.
On social and economic policies, the New Reform Party’s platform likewise aligns with the Yoon government in supporting the expansion of South Korea’s semiconductor industry and abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality.
Particularly on gender issues, the New Reform Party could push the Yoon government further toward positions that appeal to younger male conservative voters, such as by introducing female military service. At present, only men are subject to South Korea’s mandatory military conscription, a policy that many younger South Korean men perceive as discrimination.
Lee Nak-yon’s New Future Party is more critical of the Yoon government’s domestic and foreign policies. However, with its platform to end two-party gridlock, the New Future Party could also seek a role as an arbitrator over contentious policy issues.
The new parties could also support the opposition Democratic Party in pressuring the Yoon government to be more accountable. Specifically, Yoon could face increased demands to approve investigations on the allegations surrounding the first lady and to solicit opposition parties’ consent for future cabinet nominations.
It is still uncertain how well the breakaway parties will perform in the upcoming election. And they face competition from another new party, the National Innovation Party, that is politically aligned with the Democratic Party.
One recent election in East Asia will give these new parties encouragement: Taiwan’s legislative election in January saw a new third party become kingmaker in the legislative assembly.
If any of the new South Korean parties are able to emerge from the election as a parliamentary kingmaker, it would represent a crack in the country’s two-party system and could free up the gridlock that has dogged parliamentary politics in recent years.",2024-03-21T13:00:00Z,https://theconversation.com,The Conversation UK
South Korea to export chip worth USD 120 bn as India joins global semiconductor landscape,"Follow us on Image Source : FILE S.Korea eyes USD 120 bn chip exports as India joins global semiconductor landscape
With the rise of the semiconductor industry in India, South Korea will be proactively supporting the industry, and accelerate the development of high-bandwidth memory and artificial intelligence chips to achieve the annual export target of USD 120 billion, said Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun on Thursday.
Yonhap news agency reported that “The government will support the timely establishment of related infrastructure, secure competitive technologies, promote exports, and strengthen the ecosystem of materials, parts, equipment and fabless sectors"", Ahn said during his visit to SK Hynix's semiconductor cluster construction site.
The move comes at a time when India has embarked on an ambitious semiconductor journey, with massive investments pouring in. About USD 26 billion worth of investment proposals are currently with the Indian government for semiconductor manufacturing in the country, according to industry sources.
More than USD 18 billion worth of proposals have already been cleared by the government, which includes three new semiconductor fabrication (fab) manufacturing projects worth Rs 1.25 lakh crore.
Meanwhile, SK hynix is currently seeking to build four units of fabrication plants at the site with a budget of 120 trillion won (USD 89.5 billion) by 2046, with the groundbreaking of the first unit set to start in the first quarter of 2025.
The company plans to mainly produce DRAM and NAND flash memory chips at the cluster, which will become its flagship production hub.
During the visit, Ahn said the government plans to come up with a comprehensive strategy to have South Korean businesses take the lead in the artificial intelligence sector.
In line with these efforts, the ministry plans to launch a new department dedicated to supporting the development of the cluster, along with comprehensive support measures within this month.
The government will establish plans to enhance the competitive edge of chip equipment within the first half of the year, he added.
South Korea's chip exports have been showing signs of recovery, jumping 66.7 per cent on-year to USD 9.94 billion in February. It marked the fourth consecutive month of growth and the sharpest increase since the 69.6 per cent rise tallied in October 2017.

South Korea: Government will suspend licenses of striking doctors from next week,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s government will take final steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors next week as they refuse to end their weekslong walkouts that have burdened the country’s medical services, officials said Thursday.
More than 90% of the country’s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike for about a month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions. Their strikes have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at hospitals.
Officials say it is urgent to have more doctors because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.
The government has been taking a series of administrative steps required to suspend their licenses after they missed a government-set, Feb. 29 deadline to return to work. The steps include sending officials to formally confirm the absences of strikers, informing them of possible license suspensions and giving them chances to respond.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing Thursday that the government is expected to complete those steps for some of the striking doctors next week and will send them notices about its final decision to suspend their licenses.
Park earlier said that under South Korea’s medical law, the striking doctors could face at a minimum three-month suspensions and even indictments by prosecutors for refusing the government’s back-to-work order.
He urged the striking doctors to return to work immediately, suggesting those who end their strikes could receive softer punishments.
“They should return as soon as possible not only for patients but also for their future careers. This kind of exhaustive walkout from hospitals must not continue any longer,” Park said. “As we’ve said many times, we won’t treat those who return swiftly as equally as those who return late.”
It’s unclear whether and how many striking doctors would return to their hospitals at the last minute. According to Park, none of the strikers who were informed of their possible license suspension has responded.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would hurt South Korea’s medical services severely.
Two senior doctors, who lead an emergency doctors’ committee for the walkouts, were recently given government notices that their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors’ walkouts.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
The government aims to increase the country’s medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006. On Wednesday, the government announced detailed plans on how to allocate those additional 2,000 admission seats to universities, a sign that it won’t back down its plan.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors, with critics suspecting that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to the supply of more doctors.",2024-03-21T06:48:17Z,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press

Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would hurt South Korea’s medical services severely.
Two senior doctors, who lead an emergency doctors' committee for the walkouts, were recently given government notices that their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors' walkouts.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
The government aims to increase the country’s medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006. On Wednesday, the government announced detailed plans on how to allocate those additional 2,000 admission seats to universities, a sign that it won't back down its plan.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government's push to create more doctors, with critics suspecting that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to the supply of more doctors.

South Korea will take final steps to suspend licenses of striking junior doctors starting next week,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s government will take final steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors next week as they refuse to end their weekslong walkouts that have burdened the country’s medical services, officials said Thursday.
More than 90% of the country’s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike for about a month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions. Their strikes have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at hospitals.
Officials say it is urgent to have more doctors because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.
The government has been taking a series of administrative steps required to suspend their licenses after they missed a government-set, Feb. 29 deadline to return to work. The steps include sending officials to formally confirm the absences of strikers, informing them of possible license suspensions and giving them chances to respond.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing Thursday that the government is expected to complete those steps for some of the striking doctors next week and will send them notices about its final decision to suspend their licenses.
Park earlier said that under South Korea's medical law, the striking doctors could face at a minimum three-month suspensions and even indictments by prosecutors for refusing the government's back-to-work order.
He urged the striking doctors to return to work immediately, suggesting those who end their strikes could receive softer punishments.

Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante,"Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-21T03:50:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de

But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.

South Korea says it will suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors starting next week,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s government said Thursday it will start suspending the licenses of striking junior doctors next week.

More than 90% of the country’s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike for about a month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions. Their strikes have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at hospitals.

Officials say it is urgent to have more doctors because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.

The government has been taking a series of administrative steps required to suspend their licenses after they missed a government-set, Feb. 29 deadline to return to work. The steps include sending officials to formally confirm the absences of strikers, informing them of possible license suspensions and giving them chances to respond.

Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing Thursday that the government is expected to complete those steps for some of the striking doctors next week and will send them notices about its final decision to suspend their licenses.
Park earlier said that under South Korea's medical law, the striking doctors could face at a minimum three-month suspensions and even indictments by prosecutors for refusing the government's back-to-work order.

He urged the striking doctors to return to work immediately, suggesting those who end their strikes could receive softer punishments.
“They should return as soon as possible not only for patients but also for their future careers. This kind of exhaustive walkout from hospitals must not continue any longer,"" Park said. “As we've said many times, we won't treat those who return swiftly as equally as those who return late.”

It's unclear whether and how many striking doctors would return to their hospitals at the last minute. According to Park, none of the strikers who were informed of their possible license suspension has responded.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would hurt South Korea’s medical services severely.

Two senior doctors, who lead an emergency doctors' committee for the walkouts, were recently given government notices that their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors' walkouts.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.

The government aims to increase the country’s medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006. On Wednesday, the government announced detailed plans on how to allocate those additional 2,000 admission seats to universities, a sign that it won't back down its plan.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.

"Padres vs. Dodgers prediction: MLB Seoul Series odds, picks for Thursday","Commercial Content. 21+. Action Network is the official betting partner of the New York Post, which edits this content.
San Diego’s bullpen proved to be the difference in the Padres’ 5-2 season-opening defeat to the Dodgers in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday.
Well, that or the webbing malfunction of Jake Cronenworth’s glove.
The Padres kept Dodgers’ bats on a leash until the eighth inning when Los Angeles broke through by posting a four-spot rally. It was sparked by a ground ball that could have ended the inning, but instead escaped Cronenworth.
The second leg of the two-game series will feature Joe Musgrove against Yoshinbu Yamamoto, who will be making his MLB debut for the Dodgers after signing a 12-year, $325 million deal in the offseason.
Padres vs. Dodgers odds
Runs Line Total Moneyline Padres +1.5 (-125) Over 8.5 (-120) Padres +155 Dodgers -1.5 (+105) Under 8.5 (+100) Dodgers -185 Odds via bet365
Musgrove’s absence due to shoulder problems in the final two months of 2023 was a detrimental omission from the rotation.
The right-hander was San Diego’s most dependable starter, recording a 10-3 record with nine wins in his final 12 starts — a window in which he delivered a 1.84 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP.
Despite a shortened season for the 31-year-old, Musgrove finished with a 3.11 xERA and limited quality of contact to a .274 xwOBA, which were both career-highs.
He went 0-1 in two starts against the Dodgers, with a 3.38 ERA and averaging five strikeouts.
Yamamoto will counter him, grooving off three consecutive pitching triple crowns in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball league.
The right-hander brings a six-pitch mix to the mound that dominated Japanese baseball, where he posted a career 1.72 ERA in seven NPB seasons.
He had a shaky spring training (8.38 ERA), but had no issues whiffing batters with an outstanding 29.8 percent strikeout rate.

It wouldn’t be surprising to see Dave Roberts let Yamamoto settle into pitching for at least five innings, which should give plenty of leeway to a stronger bullpen staff.
The Padres burned deeper into their pen on Wednesday, but expect Mike Shildt to lean on his starters if need be considering the extended rest ahead.

Don’t place too much stock into spring training struggles from either of these guys (Musgrove posted a 13.50 ERA).
Barring the eighth-inning blunder by Padres pitching, the first game had a steady pace to it.
The Dodgers retain a strong grip on this game both offensively and defensively, but there’s enough value on the under to back two premier pitchers looking to prove something in different respects.

House passes bill banning sale of US personal data to foreign adversaries,"A week after the House of Representatives passed a bill that seeks to force TikTok to separate from its Chinese parent company, it passed a second bill that aims to protect Americans’ data from foreign adversaries.
The Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, or HR 7520, would prohibit data brokers from selling Americans’ personally identifiable information to foreign adversaries, including countries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Data brokers can face penalties from the Federal Trade Commission if they’re found to have sold sensitive information like location or health data to these countries. The bill sailed through the House, with all 414 lawmakers who voted opting to pass it.
The bill, led by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ), was unanimously voted out of committee alongside the TikTok bill that similarly passed the House with broad support. Lawmakers hope the combination of legislation will protect US internet users and safeguard US national security.
McMorris Rodgers and Pallone said in a joint statement Wednesday that the legislation “builds on our efforts in the House last week to pass H.R. 7521 — with overwhelming and bipartisan support — and serves as an important complement to more comprehensive national data privacy legislation, which we remain committed to working together on.”
Unlike the TikTok bill, this one does not name individual companies. But it imposes a broad limit on data brokers’ ability to “sell, license, rent, trade, transfer, release, disclose, provide access to, or otherwise make available sensitive data of a United States individual” to foreign adversaries or organizations they control. It also gives the Federal Trade Commission authority to enforce the legislation.
The sensitive data covered by the bill includes biometric and genetic information, Social Security numbers, health diagnoses or treatments, and precise geolocation data.",2024-03-20T20:46:10Z,https://www.theverge.com,The Verge
Montenegro court confirms mogul known as 'cryptocurrency king' to be extradited to South Korea,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — An appeals court in Montenegro on Wednesday confirmed that a South Korean mogul known as “the cryptocurrency king” will be handed over to his native country.
Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro. A Montenegrin court initially decided he should be handed over to the U.S. but that ruling was later overturned in favor of South Korea.
The Appeals Court of Montenegro approved an earlier ruling by the High Court to extradite Kwon to South Korea rather than the United States, a statement said. He has no further avenues for appeal.
Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York.
It was not immediately clear when Kwon would be handed over. Kwon’s lawyer in Montenegro, Goran Rodic, said that “we are content with the decision of the Appeals Court.”
“It is now a binding decision and the law envisages that further handover procedure will be handled by the justice ministries of Montenegro and South Korea, as well as the relevant police authorities who will determine the time, location and conditions of the handover,” Rodic told The Associated Press.
The 32-year-old Kwon was arrested in the Balkan nation last year over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world.
Kwon and another South Korean were arrested while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. He has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport.
Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022.
TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.",2024-03-20T19:51:00Z,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press
Brugg Group steigert Umsatz,"Aargauer Wirtschaft Brugg Group kann Umsatz steigern – doch im Liftbereich drückt China auf die Bremse Das vorwiegend international ausgerichtete Unternehmen aus dem Aargau spricht von «Wachstum in einem schwierigen Umfeld». Dennoch: Der Firmenstandort in Birr wird ausgebaut – auch dank Grossauftrag aus Korea.
Sie können auf ein gutes Geschäftsjahr 2023 zurückblicken (von links): Stephan Wartmann, CEO Brugg Group, Markus Grüter, CEO Brugg Lifting, Jürg Suhner, VR-Präsident, und Andrea Roth, CEO Brugg Ropes. Bild: Alex Spichale
Auf dem grossen Feld bei der Siedlung Wyde in Birr gedeiht aktuell nicht nur Kohl: Im Umfeld der Fabrik der Aufzugsseilspezialistin Brugg Lifting sind mehrere Bauprofile ausgesteckt, eine neue Produktionsstätte für die Firma Brugg eConnect ist geplant, weiter hinten entsteht ein neuer regionaler Werkhof, dereinst auch eine grössere Strasse. Ab April soll zudem die Produktionshalle der Brugg Lifting erweitert werden – dort wartet man auf die Baubewilligung.
Dass die global tätige Unternehmensgruppe Brugg den vergleichsweise wohl teureren Produktionsstandort Birr ausbaut, mag auf den ersten Blick überraschen, hat aber durchweg wirtschaftliche Gründe. Ein Beispiel: Die koreanische Firma Hyundai will Tragseile kaufen, wünscht sich aber aus politischer Überlegung unbedingt eine Zulieferung aus der Schweiz und nicht aus dem Werk von Brugg Lifting im benachbarten China. Dafür muss die Produktionskapazität in Birr verdoppelt werden.

Rund 9 Millionen Franken kostet der Ausbau der Anlage von Brugg Lifting, plus 3 Millionen für die zusätzliche Maschine, wie Markus Grüter, CEO von Brugg Lifting, an der Bilanzmedienkonferenz am Mittwoch erklärte. Ab September bereits soll diese in Betrieb gehen, drei bis vier neue Personen dafür angestellt.
«Die steigenden Baukosten hierzulande bereiten Sorgen für die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Schweiz», fügte Andrea Roth, CEO von Brugg Ropes, an. Bei einem Rundgang durch die Fabrik wurde aber auch klar, dass die Schweiz wegen den ausgeklügelten Technologien und der hohen Qualität ganz vorne mitspielt. Der Bereich Qualitätssicherung fällt in Birr auf: Mehrere Millionen seien in verschiedene Prüfmaschinen investiert worden.

Umsatz gestiegen, doch China bereitet Sorgen
Die Brugg Group wächst, trotz «schwierigem Umfeld», wie das Unternehmen an einer Medienkonferenz am Mittwoch bekannt gab. Letztes Jahr stieg der Umsatz der Gruppe um 4,4 Prozent auf 668 Millionen Franken. Gestiegen sind auch die Investitionen von 33 auf 55 Millionen Franken sowie die Anzahl Mitarbeitende von 1832 auf 2058. Von den 226 neuen Stellen entstanden 72 in der Schweiz.
Nicht alle sieben Unternehmensbereiche haben 2023 aber gleich gute Zahlen erzielt. Ausgerechnet Brugg Lifting, die grösste Firma der Brugg Group, verzeichnete einen Rückgang um minus 8 Prozent. Sorgen bereiten die schwächelnde Wirtschaft in Deutschland und die Immobilienkrise in China. «Wir haben Pläne für alles, aber die Welt gehorcht nicht unseren Plänen. Das war ein wenig das Motto von 2023», bringt es Verwaltungsratspräsident Jürg Suhner auf den Punkt.
Jürg Suhner, VR-Präsident der Brugg Group. Bild: Alex Spichale
Es gibt aber durchaus Positives aus der Welt zu berichten: Brugg Fatzer zum Beispiel, das in Romanshorn Transport- und Infrastrukturseile herstellt, konnte den Umsatz um 9 Prozent steigern. Die Anfrage touristischer Bergbahnen stieg, dazu wird die teils veraltete Bahninfrastruktur in Nordamerika erneuert.
Geobrugg, Entwicklerin von Schutznetzsystemen, erhöhte den Umsatz um 7 Prozent. Mit Kauf eines Werks in Korea und Eröffnung einer Fabrik in Indien – wo das neu unterzeichnete Freihandelsabkommen eine grosse Hilfe sein wird, wie Andrea Roth sagte –, entstanden 57 neue Stellen, davon 3 in der Schweiz. Bei Brugg Pipes kamen 103 neue Stellen hinzu, 33 in der Schweiz. Der Grund sind Firmenkäufe in Deutschland, aber auch eine zusätzliche Produktionslinie in Kleindöttingen. Der Umsatz stieg um 5 Prozent.
Diese Produktionslinie für ummantelte Tragseile von Brugg Lifting (im Hintergrund) soll verdoppelt werden. Im Bild (von links): Stephan Wartmann, Markus Grüter, Jürg Suhner und Andrea Roth. Bild: Alex Spichale
Brugg eConnect – den Firmenteil, den die Brugg Group nach dem Verkauf von Brugg Cables 2019 behalten hat – stellt in Windisch Spezialkabel für die Windenergie oder die E-Mobilität her und steigerte den Umsatz um 6 Prozent. So auch Brugg Rittmeyer, das Systeme für die Wasser- und Energieversorgung für Kunden wie Alpiq oder Axpo anbietet – aber etwa auch Venedig mit dem weltweit grössten Wasserbauwerk vor der Überschwemmung rettet.
Der kleine Firmenbereich Brugg Real Estate stieg um 9 Prozent. Das alte Verwaltungsgebäude in Windisch wurde für 9 Millionen Franken renoviert und ans Lernwerk vermietet.
Ein CEO ohne eigenes Büro
Dass die fünf stärksten Absatzmärkte in der Seildivision der Brugg Gruppe die USA, Südafrika, Italien, Australien und Deutschland sind, zeugt erneut von der internationalen Präsenz des Aargauer Unternehmens. Grosses Potenzial wird aktuell auch in Saudiarabien gewittert. Meistens wird aber nicht exportiert, sondern lokal produziert und von der Schweiz aus verwaltet.
«Über 90 Prozent des Bevölkerungswachstums in den nächsten 20 Jahren findet ausserhalb von Europa statt», sagte Stephan Wartmann, CEO der Brugg Group. Das Unternehmen müsse international agieren. Er selbst spüre es daran, dass er als CEO seit fünf Jahren kein eigenes Büro habe, sondern immer unterwegs sei. «Mein Platz ist an der Kundenfront.» Ausgerichtet ist das Unternehmen zunehmend auch auf die Bereiche Energiewende und Infrastruktursicherheit, wie er darlegte. «Wir wollen da Pioniere sein und die Entwicklung mitprägen.»",2024-03-20T19:00:00Z,https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch,Aargauer Zeitung
"Dodgers awaken late, beat Padres in Korea for MLB season-opener","1 of 5 | Designated hitter Shohei Ohtani went 2 for 5 with an RBI and stolen base in his Los Angeles Dodgers debut Wednesday in Seoul. File Photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo
March 20 (UPI) -- Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers offense warmed up late with a four-run eighth inning -- and needed a little luck -- to edge the San Diego Padres 5-2 in the first game of the 2024 MLB season Wednesday in Seoul. Ohtani, who made his Dodgers regular-season debut, went 2 for 5 with an RBI and stolen base. Shortstop Mookie Betts went 2 for 4 with an RBI in the victory. Advertisement
Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow -- another major off-season signing -- allowed two hits and two runs over five innings, but was not on record for a decision.
""The biggest thing is that we got that W and the way we got it,"" Ohtani told reporters, according to MLB.com. ""Coming back late in the game like that proves that we're a really good team.""

The game between the National League West rivals is part of a two-part Seoul Series, while MLB's other 28 teams remain active in spring training. The final game of the series will be Thursday on the same field at Gocheok Sky Dome.
""It was a really cool experience,"" Glasnow said at his postgame news conference. ""It was super unique. I'm glad we got to get a win. I'm just glad it didn't spiral out. ... It's cool to get the first win here.""
Neither team logged a hit in the first inning in front of the nearly 16,000 fans in attendance Wednesday in South Korea's capital city.
The Padres ended the deadlock in the third, when second baseman Xander Bogaerts plated third baseman Tyler Wade with a line drive single to center field.
Dodgers right fielder Jason Heyward tied the score with an RBI sacrifice fly in the top of the fourth. The Padres went ahead for the second time when designated hitter Manny Machado scored while catcher Luis Campusano grounded into a double play in the bottom of the fourth.

The Dodgers threatened with two baserunners in the fifth and one in the sixth and seventh, but could not level the score into their eighth-inning outburst.
Glasnow retired the Padres in order in the fifth, but was replaced in the sixth. Relief pitchers Ryan Brasier, Daniel Hudson, Joe Kelly and Evan Phillips allowed just two hits, while not issuing a walk or surrendering a run, over the final four innings.
Padres relief pitcher Wandy Peralta walked Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy to start the eighth. Outfielder Teoscar Hernandez followed with a single to center off Padres reliever Jhony Brito, sending Muncy to second.
Brito followed with a four-pitch walk of Dodgers center fielder James Outman. Muncy then came in to score the game-tying run on a sacrifice fly from outfielder Enrique Hernandez.
The Dodgers caught a lucky break en route to the go-ahead run.
Second baseman Gavin Lux started that play when he chopped an Adrian Morejon sinker between first and second base. Padres first baseman Jake Cronenworth went to field the ball, but it went through a gap of webbing in his glove and rolled into the outfield, allowing Teoscar Hernandez to score from second base.

Betts swatted a ground-ball single to left three pitches later for a 4-2 Dodgers lead. Ohtani hit the next pitch to left, plating Lux for the final run of the game. Kelly and Phillips then took the mound and held back the Padres offense over the final two innings.
""I thought Tyler kept his wits about him and kept us in the ballgame,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. ""The offense came alive at the end. It was a good ballgame. I expect more games like this.""
Bogaerts went 2 for 4 with an RBI for the Padres. Padres starter Yu Darvish allowed two hits and a run, while issuing three walks and three strikeouts, over 3 2/3 innings. He was not on record for a decision.
Ohtani, who underwent elbow surgery in September and will not pitch this season, recorded the hardest hit of the game. His third-inning single off Darvish traveled 112.3 mph off his bat, according to Statcast.
Game 2 will air at 6:05 a.m. EDT Thursday on ESPN. Joe Musgrove is expected to start for the Padres. Fellow right-handed pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto -- who signed a $325 million deal in December -- will start for the Dodgers.

Why you should back the Dodgers
Los Angeles starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been a dominant pitcher in Japan over the past several seasons. Signed in the offseason to a 12-year, $325 million contract, Yamamoto throws six pitches, including a four-seam fastball, splitter and curve. He had a career 1.72 ERA in Japan in almost 1,000 innings and went 16-6 with a 1.21 ERA for the Orix Buffaloes last year.
In addition, Shohei Ohtani already seems to be in midseason form. In Wednesday's season opener, he went 2-for-5, including a rocket base hit to right field, and drove in a run. He is coming off a season in which he led the majors in OPS (1.066), ranked fourth in home runs (44) despite playing just 135 games and won his second American League MVP Award. See which team to back here.
Why you should back the Padres
San Diego starter Joe Musgrove ended last season on a roll. Over his final 12 starts of last season, Musgrove went 9-1 with a 1.84 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP. The Padres went 9-3 over those 12 games. This year, the 31-year-old righty is coming off his best start of spring training, allowing just two hits and one run over 4.1 innings against Oakland.
The Padres have a bullpen to give the Dodgers' lefty-heavy lineup problems in the late innings. Because of an expanded roster for the Seoul Series, manager Mike Shildt has four lefties at his disposal to play mix-and-match. That bodes well against a Los Angeles lineup that on Wednesday featured six lefthanded batters. See which team to back here.

Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro. A Montenegrin court initially decided he should be handed over to the U.S. but that ruling was later overturned in favor of South Korea.

The Appeals Court of Montenegro approved an earlier ruling by the High Court to extradite Kwon to South Korea rather than the United States, a statement said. He has no further avenues for appeal.

Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York.
It was not immediately clear when Kwon would be handed over. Kwon's lawyer in Montenegro, Goran Rodic, said that “we are content with the decision of the Appeals Court.”

“It is now a binding decision and the law envisages that further handover procedure will be handled by the justice ministries of Montenegro and South Korea, as well as the relevant police authorities who will determine the time, location and conditions of the handover,” Rodic told The Associated Press.
The 32-year-old Kwon was arrested in the Balkan nation last year over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world.

Kwon and another South Korean were arrested while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. He has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport.
Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022.

TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.",2024-03-20T15:51:00Z,https://qz.com,Quartz India
Japan v North Korea World Cup qualifier resumes rivalry that extends beyond football,"A place at the next football World Cup is not all that is at stake when Japan and North Korea meet on Thursday for the first of two qualifying matches, in a resumption of one of the fiercest rivalries in international football.
Despite the huge gap between the countries’ economies and the profiles of their domestic leagues, few expect the match at Tokyo’s national stadium to be a walkover for the Japanese, who are 18th in the Fifa rankings, 96 places above their opponents.
Meetings between the two countries have always been about more than football. On one side, a former colonial power allied to Pyongyang’s arch-enemy, the US; on the other, a dictatorship that has sent ballistic missiles over Japan and abducted dozens of its citizens.
Pundits expect the Samurai Blue to win in front of a highly partisan crowd, but they will be in unfamiliar, hostile territory five days later for the return leg at the 50,000-seat Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang. With a week to go before kick-off for that second match, it was not clear if North Korean supporters – mainly military and party elites – would be allowed to attend.
Geopolitics is never far away when the two teams meet. The qualifiers for the 2026 tournament, co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, come soon after the North test-launched short-range ballistic missiles and the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, oversaw a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable rocket launchers designed to target Seoul. The country’s million-strong army, Kim said this week, should “prepare for war”.
The visiting players, who were permitted to travel as an exception to sanctions barring North Koreans from entering Japan, will not be without support. Among the expected 68,000 crowd will be several thousand members of Japan’s 150,000-strong North Korean community, many of whom are descended from people forcibly brought to work in Japan during Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula.

The 4,000 tickets for seats in the North Korean section of the stadium sold out immediately, while the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan – North Korea’s de facto embassy – urged ethnic minority zainichi Koreans with connections to the North to cheer for the visitors.
Risa Ho, an ethnic North Korean living in Tokyo, said she would be supporting the visitors on Thursday. “I love Japanese footballers and I usually support Japan, but not when they play North Korea,” said Ho, who will be in the crowd at the national stadium.
“It’s complicated, and I feel a little bit conflicted, but when it comes to the national team I want to support North Korea,” added Ho, who predicted some frank exchanges between rival supporters on Thursday. “The political backdrop means these games always have an edge.”
As for the result, Ho predicted a 2-1 win for Japan, but believed North Korea would still make the World Cup finals. “North Korea is putting a lot of effort into improving its sports teams, and that includes football,” she said, adding that Kim, known for his love of NBA basketball, also followed football.
North Korea have historically punched well above their weight in international football. At the 1966 World Cup in England, the unknown team stunned Italy with a 1-0 win in a decisive group match, only to be beaten 5-3 by Portugal in the quarter-final after leading 3-0.

Their record against Japan suggests that the results of the two games are far from fait accompli for the Samurai Blue, who began their World Cup campaign with comfortable wins over Asian minnows Syria and Myanmar. In the two countries’ 20 meetings since 1975, the men’s senior teams have each won eight and drawn four.
Previous fixtures between North Korea and Japan have occasionally seen the mutual animosity spill over on to the pitch. The Japan U-23’s 2-1 victory over the North at the Asian Games last October was marred when members of the losing team clashed with match officials and security staff.
“I admit that our players were a little bit over-excited in the match, but that’s football,” North Korea’s coach, Sin Yong Nam, said afterwards. “But there are confrontations in football matches … I think our behaviour was acceptable.”
When the countries’ women’s teams played each other in Tokyo last month, North Korean fans turned a section of the stadium into a blanket of red, with some waving flags urging their players to “protect the dignity of the republic” – a reference to North Korea’s official name the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).
Like other athletes from the secretive country, the players were confined to their accommodation, training ground and stadium, and banned from speaking to Japanese or South Koreans, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
Contests between Korean and Japanese teams can summon mixed emotions among younger ethnic Koreans in Japan.
“I was born and brought up in Japan, so to be honest, I knew the Japan players’ names and faces better than the DPRK players from seeing them on TV,” An Yong-hak, a former North Korean international, told Agence France-Presse this week.
“But I am an ethnic Korean, and my name is An Yong-hak. I thought of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as my national team, and I always worked hard with that in mind.”

As North Korea attempt to qualify for their first World Cup since 2010, An attempted to play down the historical and political tensions that have made this one of the qualifying rounds’ most anticipated matches.
Recalling his team’s injury-time defeat against Japan in a World Cup qualifier in 2006, he held out hope that, whatever the result on Thursday, fair play will prevail.
“After that game we all shook hands and waved to the Japanese fans,” An said. “It was a great game that went beyond the result, and I hope this time is the same.”

Seoul MLB opener: Shohei Ohtani makes winning debut for Dodgers,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —
Shohei Ohtani’s Los Angeles Dodgers brought Major League Baseball (MLB) to South Korea on Wednesday night, overshadowing Seoul hometown star Kim Ha-seong’s San Diego Padres in a 5-2 victory.
The first clash of the two-game Seoul Series opened the MLB season and showcased an international appeal brought to the sport by an increasing lineup of Asian stars led by two-way Japanese star Ohtani, who joined the Dodgers in the offseason, signing the richest deal ever made by a major leaguer.
Earlier on Wednesday, South Korea police said they had received a report about an email threatening to detonate a bomb during the game to hurt Ohtani.
About 150 police officers were dispatched to the stadium to search for any threats, but they found no explosives.

The biggest name in baseball worldwide
Clearly, thousands of those in Seoul’s Gocheok Skydome were there to see Ohtani, who delivered two hits, an RBI and a stolen base to please the crowd.
Ohtani’s wife – Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka – was also in attendance, with the ESPN broadcast showing her giving high fives to some of the women in nearby seats after one of her husband’s hits.
Ohtani may be the biggest name in baseball worldwide, but in South Korea, the top billing belongs to Padres shortstop Kim Ha-seong.
The Korean star garnered the biggest cheers from the crowd and his San Diego team clearly was the home team – and it deserved to be. After all, the Skydome used to be Kim’s home stadium when he played for the Kiwoom Heroes in the Korea Baseball Organization’s (KBO) League.
When Padres starter Yu Darvish got out of a bases-loaded jam with a strikeout in the top of the third inning, the stadium erupted with applause.
But when the Dodgers loaded the bases again in the eighth inning with no outs, it was too much for the Padres to turn back, as the LA team erupted for four runs to seal the win.

The Dodgers rally drew loud cheers from the fans, demonstrating a local excitement that MLB decided to bring its biggest star to Seoul to start the season.
This was an MLB game that showcased Asia both on and off the diamond. Not only were the most popular players Asian, the between-innings entertainment featured each team’s cheerleaders performing K-pop routines.
Korean fan Park Jun-hyuk said he was at the stadium to see Ohtani.
Ohtani “is like the best player you’d see in 100 years. And the fact that such a player is in South Korea as a Dodgers player to play in the opening game is so meaningful that I decided to come here,” Park told CNN.
Motoki Sato, a 26-year-old from Japan, said he’s followed Ohtani since he was a high school star, though this was his first time to see the two-way superstar in person. It was also Sato’s first Dodgers game.
“Previously, I supported the Angles, the team where Ohtani was at,” Sato said as he smiled.
He was wearing Dodger colors on Wednesday, like thousands of others in the crowd, many of them scoring their merchandise in a souvenir tent outside the stadium before gametime.
More than two hours before the first pitch, a line wound around the MLB merchandise tent as staff let fans inside in groups to prevent crowding in the store. Anybody wearing team merchandise had it tagged before going in.
Inside, less expensive souvenirs were mostly sold out, while the prized Ohtani number jerseys were pulled off the shelves almost as soon as they were displayed.
The Padres side of the store was less frenzied, but still busy. South Korea’s Kim was a favorite.
The Seoul Series, a two-game series between the two teams, features the first MLB regular-season games played in Korea. It’s the ninth time that MLB has opened its season outside the 50 US states and Canada. The last time that happened was in 2019, when the Oakland Athletics faced the Seattle Mariners in Tokyo.

Padres shortstop Kim, who is from Bucheon (about 15.5 miles away from Seoul), received a warm ovation from the crowd for his first at-bat in the bottom of the second inning.
He was making his return to the ballpark where he played for the Kiwoom Heroes. He acknowledged the crowd by raising his batting helmet. Kim went 0-for-3 with a walk on the night.
Brenda and Gerardo Marquez had traveled from San Diego to Seoul for the two-game series, lucky winners of tickets for reserved for Padres fans.
They had to see Kim play in his home country.
“It’s all about Ha-Seong Kim for us tonight, so looking for that win and to see him here at home,” said Brenda Marquez.
Gerardo said the couple, who came to Seoul with their three young daughters, made reservations to be here even before they won the ticket lottery.

The Padres might have lost, but the trip was still a win-win for the Marquez family. Their daughters are huge BTS fans – “obsessed with them,” said Gerardo – while Brenda said she would have been satisfied to be just near the stadium.
“We would have just walked around outside if we hadn’t gotten (tickets),” she said after her family got to see Kim on his home turf – and those K-pop routines between innings.",2024-03-20T15:09:27Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network

About 150 police officers used sniffer dogs, X-ray detectors and other equipment to search through the stadium, but no suspicious objects were discovered, according to Seoul’s Guro police station.

No explosives found at Seoul stadium in police search following bomb threat against Ohtani,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean police said they’ve found no explosives at Seoul’s Gocheok Sky Dome after searching the site Wednesday following a reported bomb threat against Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani.
About 150 police officers used sniffer dogs, X-ray detectors and other equipment to search through the stadium, but no suspicious objects were discovered, according to Seoul’s Guro police station.
Police officers said they acted on a tip that there was a threat targeting the Japanese star but didn’t elaborate.
South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said the search happened after South Korea's consulate general in Vancouver, Canada received an email threatening to detonate an explosive at the Gocheok stadium during the Major League Baseball opening game between the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres scheduled to start later Wednesday. The game will mark the first MLB regular season game in South Korea.
Yonhap said the sender of the English-language email claimed to be a Japanese lawyer. Yonhap cited police as suspecting the email might have come from a person who last year allegedly sent a number of similar threatening emails and faxes while claiming to be a Japanese lawyer.

"Shohei Ohtani, Dodgers target of bomb threat ahead of MLB opener in Seoul","There was a moment of anxiety in the buildup to the start of MLB’s season abroad.
According to multiple reports, Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, South Korea — where the Dodgers will play the Padres on Thursday at 6 a.m. Eastern — was the target of a bomb threat that specifically named superstar Shohei Ohtani.
An email that police received in Seoul, according to the San Diego Tribune, threatened to detonate a bomb at the stadium during the game.

Nevertheless, the Los Angeles Times reported that the threat — which was written in English — was not credible and written by someone who has done similar acts in the past.
Yonhap News Agency in Korea reported that local police were attempting to track down the person who sent the bomb threat and that 30 commandos and 120 personnel were being sent to search Gocheok Sky Dome, though “no dangerous or suspicious situation has been found yet.”
MLB released a statement, according to multiple outlets, saying it was working to ensure the safety of all involved ahead of the highly anticipated opener.
“The safety and security of our fans and everyone in the ballparks where we play are always our first priority,” the statement read. “MLB Security works closely with local officials to ensure a safe environment for all those who attend our games. MLB, along with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and other local officials, will continue to monitor the situation closely and take any appropriate steps throughout the event.”
The game, which kicks off the 2024 season, has plenty of intrigue as Ohtani is set to make his Dodgers debut after signing a historic 10-year, $700 million contract this offseason.

Dodgers fire Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter Ippei Mizuhara amid ‘massive theft’ allegations,"By Andy McCullough, Fabian Ardaya, Sam Blum and Britt Ghiroli
The Los Angeles Dodgers have fired Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, after Ohtani’s representatives accused Mizuhara of engaging in a “massive theft,” using the player’s money to place bets with an allegedly illegal bookmaker under federal investigation.
“In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft, and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,” Berk Brettler LLP, the firm representing Ohtani, said in a statement.

The accusation by Berk Brettler followed an inquiry from The Los Angeles Times. The newspaper learned Ohtani’s name surfaced in an investigation of an Orange County resident named Matthew Bowyer. Mizuhara, 39, placed bets with Bowyer, according to the newspaper.
Mizuhara did not respond to a request for comment. Ohtani is not currently facing discipline, according to an MLB official.
“The Dodgers are aware of media reports and are gathering information,” the club said in a statement. “The team can confirm that interpreter Ippei Mizuhara has been terminated. The team has no further comment at this time.”
Ohtani’s involvement initially was described as aiding Mizuhara, as a spokesman for Ohtani said the player transferred the funds to cover Mizuhara’s gambling debt. Mizuhara reportedly gave his account in a 90-minute interview with ESPN on Tuesday in which he said Ohtani paid off gambling debts totaling roughly $4.5 million and did not give the money to Mizuhara directly because he didn’t trust his interpreter to not “gamble it away.” Before Mizuhara’s interview published, the spokesman disavowed Mizuhara’s account and said Ohtani’s lawyers would issue a statement.
Mizuhara said on Wednesday that Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activity, debts or attempts to pay them.
Ohtani made his Dodger debut Wednesday evening in Seoul, South Korea, against the San Diego Padres. He is in the first year of a 10-year, $700 million contract, with $680 million in deferrals. Mizuhara has worked with Ohtani since the player debuted with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018.
Ohtani and Mizuhara’s relationship, which dates back to Ohtani’s days with the Nippon Ham Fighters of NPB, is closer than most between players and interpreters. For much of the last seven years, they were rarely seen apart. They drove to the ballpark together, with Mizuhara essentially serving as Ohtani’s driver before the two-way star got his driver’s license in his early seasons with the Angels. Whenever Ohtani threw, Mizuhara would be close behind, with either a phone camera recording his mechanics or a pocket radar gun tracking data. Mizuhara told The Athletic last year he saw Ohtani more than his own wife, and that the pair even spent Christmas in Los Angeles working out together.

During baseball’s lockout in 2022, when players and club staff weren’t able to interact, Mizuhara quit his job so he could continue to work alongside Ohtani.
In a lighthearted moment this spring at Dodgerfest, in front of a packed crowd at Dodger Stadium, former Angels and current Dodgers radio personality José Mota asked Ohtani to define their relationship. He immediately started laughing.
“We’re not friends,” he deadpanned through Mizuhara, “we’re business partners.”
Most major leaguers play catch with teammates or receive instruction from coaches. That was not the case with Ohtani. When the two-way superstar went out to throw plyo balls against the outfield wall, he did it with Mizuhara. When a new pitcher came into the game with Ohtani on deck, it was Mizuhara who walked out with the iPad to break down his new matchup.
Mizuhara became a fan favorite in Anaheim — so much so that when the public address announcer introduced players and staff last season before the home opener, Mizuhara received the second loudest ovation from the crowd, behind only Ohtani.
According to a league source, MLB hasn’t been contacted by prosecutors. The MLBPA declined comment, and Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, declined multiple requests for comment.
Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani as recently as Wednesday night’s season-opening win against the Padres in Seoul, South Korea. Ahead of the flight, Ohtani, Mizuhara and their wives posed with Yoshinobu Yamamoto and his interpreter, Yoshihiro Sonoda, for a photo. Ohtani posted the photo to his Instagram. When reporters approached Wednesday to talk to Ohtani about the game, Mizuhara had ducked out into the hallway of the clubhouse, emerging only at the end of Ohtani’s scrum with reporters and interpreting three brief English questions about the game.
According to ESPN, Mizuhara addressed the Dodgers clubhouse to discuss the upcoming story about his gambling. The scene of people pouring out of the clubhouse before media was let in included Dodgers owner Mark Walter and CEO Stan Kasten.

North Korea claims progress in developing a hypersonic missile designed to strike distant US targets,"North Korea successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile, state media reported on Wednesday, claiming a progress in efforts to develop a more powerful, agile missile designed to strike faraway US targets in the region.
A hypersonic missile is among an array of high-tech weapons systems that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly vowed to introduce in 2021 to cope with what he called deepening US hostility.
Outside experts say Kim wants a modernised weapons arsenal to wrest US concessions like sanctions relief when diplomacy resumes.
On Tuesday, Kim guided the ground jet test of the multi-stage solid-fuel engine for the hypersonic missile at the North's northwestern rocket launch facility, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.
It cited Kim as saying the strategic value of the new missile with an intermediate-range is as important as intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland and that ""enemies know better about it"".
It said that a timetable for completing the development of the new weapons system was ""set through the great success in the important test"".
Intermediate-range missiles possessed or pursued by North Korea are the weapons systems primarily aimed at attacking the US Pacific territory of Guam, home to US military bases.
Those missile can also reach Alaska, and with a range adjustment they can be used to strike closer targets like US military installations in Japan's Okinawa island, experts say.
In recent years, North Korea has been pushing to develop more weapons with built-in solid propellants, which make launches harder to detect than liquid-propellant missiles that must be fuelled before liftoffs and cannot last long.
The North's pursuit of hypersonic weapons is also meant to defeat US and South Korean missile defence systems, but it's unclear the North's hypersonic vehicles proved their desired speed and maneuverability during tests in recent years, analysts say.
In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic, maneuverable warhead, in a likely reference to the missile mentioned in Wednesday's KCNA dispatch.
In November, North Korea said it had tested engine tests for an intermedia-range missile but didn't say whether it's designed to carry a hypersonic warhead.
While the North's missile test in January was likely related to the development of its first-stage rocket, this week's engine test appeared focused on the development of its second-stage rocket in part of the North's efforts to increase the weapon's flying speed, said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea's Research Institute for National Strategy.
Chang said the latest engine test suggests North Korea could soon test-launch the new hypersonic missile.
After short-range tests with hypersonic weapons, North Korea would want to increase their ranges with maneuverable hypersonic warheads, Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute, said. He said the capacities of the new missile can be assessed when it's test-flighted.
On Monday, South Korea, the US and Japan said they detected the multiple ballistic missile test-launches by North Korea in what was the country's first missile firings in about a month. The North said on Tuesday it performed a live-fire drill of what it called nuclear-capable ""super-large"" multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea's capital, Seoul. South Korea's military later said it views the North Korean weapons system tested as a ballistic missile.
North Korea has been engaging in a provocative run of missile tests since 2022. The US and South Korea militaries have responded by expanding their bilateral exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan. Observers say North Korea will likely intensify its run of missile tests ahead of the US presidential election in November.

State media said on Wednesday that North Korea has successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile.

The North’s pursuit of hypersonic weapons is also meant to defeat US and South Korean missile defense systems, but it’s unclear the North’s hypersonic vehicles consistently maintained a desired speed exceeding Mach 5 during tests in 2021 and 2022, experts say.

In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead, in an apparent reference to the missile mentioned in Wednesday’s KCNA dispatch. In November, North Korea said it had tested engine tests for the missile.
On Monday, South Korea, the US and Japan said they detected the multiple ballistic missile test-launches by North Korea in what was the country’s first missile firings in about a month. The North said Tuesday it performed a live-fire drill of what it called nuclear-capable “super-large” multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea’s capital, Seoul. South Korea’s military later said it views the North Korean weapons system tested as a ballistic missile.

North Korea has been engaging in a provocative run of missile tests since 2022. The US and South Korea militaries have responded by expanding their bilateral exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan. Observers say North Korea will likely intensify its run of missile tests ahead of the US presidential election in November.",2024-03-20T02:29:26Z,https://www.firstpost.com,Firstpost
"Chan Ho Park, first Korean player in MLB, will throw the first pitch in the Seoul Series","A retired Korean baseball legend is returning to the mound for the first game of the Major League Baseball regular season — and the first ever held in South Korea.
Former pitcher Chan Ho Park, the first Korean-born athlete to play in MLB, is scheduled to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the season opener in Seoul on Wednesday between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres. Park made his debut with the Dodgers in 1994 and played with the Padres from 2005 to 2006.
“I think that it’s sort of a culmination for him,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, a former teammate of Park’s, told The Athletic about Park’s first pitch. “He was a pioneer as a Korean-born player to come to the States and to be a star player.”
Park will kick off a two-game “Seoul Series” between the teams at the Gocheok SkyDome, marking not only the first games of the regular season but also the first regular season games ever played in Korea.

Park’s debut as a reliever against the Atlanta Braves forged a new path for other Korean baseball stars, including former MLB players Byung-Hyun Kim and Hyun Jin Ryu and current Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim. During his 17 years in the league, Park, known as “The Korean Express,” also spent time with the New York Mets, the Philadelphia Phillies, the New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
His career in the U.S. concluded with the Pirates on Oct. 1, 2010, with a win against the Florida Marlins that helped him clinch the MLB record for most wins by an Asian pitcher.
“I became a messenger to the people for a lot of positive,” Park told The Athletic, reflecting on the pressure he experienced representing Korea. “And they were cheering me up, but I had to pitch well to cheer them up, the whole country.”
Today, Park, who retired from playing baseball in 2012 with the Hanwha Eagles in South Korea, is still involved in the game as a baseball operations adviser with the Padres.
While Park’s appearance is highly anticipated, Korean fans have also been awaiting the return of Kim, a former favorite in the country’s Korean Baseball Organization League, who in November became the first Asian-born infielder to win MLB’s Gold Glove Award. Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani will also make his debut with the Dodgers during the series after he clinched the largest contract in North American sports history and signed for $700 million over 10 years.

T1 LoL team gives shoutout to San Diego Padres ahead of MLB games in Korea,"Major League Baseball is opening its 2024 season with two games in Seoul this week and arguably the most successful sporting franchise in Korea right now, T1’s League of Legends team, has declared its allegiance to one of the two teams coming to Seoul for the opening series.
Recommended Videos
In a video posted to social media earlier today, the five starters of T1’s League World Championship-winning squad each donned San Diego Padres jerseys and gave a quick shoutout to the team.
T1 most definitely chose the Padres as their team because of the team’s strong ties to Korea. The Padres’ shortstop, Ha-Seong Kim, is a Korean baseball star who made a name for himself with the Kiwoom Heroes in the KBO before joining the Padres in 2020. T1 mentioned Kim by name in the video, congratulating him on becoming the first Korean player to win a Gold Glove award, which he captured after the 2023 MLB season.
England has The Beatles, Korea has Ha-Seong. pic.twitter.com/XQSUr65Gh9 — San Diego Padres (@Padres) March 18, 2024
The team also gave some recognition to Woo-Suk Go, a pitcher for the Padres of Korean descent, who is making his MLB debut this year after spending the first four years of his career in the KBO. T1 ADC Gumayusi gave a special shoutout to Woo-Suk Go as the pitcher apparently has a reputation for maining ADC himself in League.
Tomorrow’s games between the Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers will be the first games of the 2024 MLB regular season. While other teams are still participating in Spring Training, the two NL West squads will begin their season with real games that actually count toward the 162-game schedule.
When the Seoul Series begins tomorrow, MLB fans in America will finally know League of Legends fans’ pain as they’ll have to wake up super early to watch the games. First pitch for tomorrow’s season opener between the Padres and Dodgers is scheduled for 5:05am CT.

SEOUL, South Korea (KABC) -- As the Dodgers gear up for their first regular-season game against the Padres in Seoul, Eyewitness News is getting to try all the delicious street foods that South Korea has to offer.
Our team visited the bustling Myeong-dong shopping area for a taste of all the mouth-watering dishes. During the food tour, they ran into some Dodger fans.
The stand-outs included the hard candy, which is a skewer of fresh fruit coated in a crunchy sugar shell.
""The candied fruit was really good. That was so good,"" said Danielle Umali of Pasadena.
Another hit was from Starchicken, a stand with a strikingly familiar logo that U.S. coffee lovers might recognize. ABC7's Rob Fukuzaki tried the sweet and sour version.
The team flew to Seoul last week and is doing all they can to get on a consistent clock. It wasn't easy following a 13-hour flight and a 16-hour time difference, and the Padres are on the same boat.
Everything that they tried evoked a sentiment similar to that expressed by Lorena from Los Angeles.
""Oh my god... the food! I'm like, I'm moving to South Korea when I retire. This amazing. It's delicious and the hospitality has been outstanding.""
The two-game series between the Dodgers and Padres, called the Seoul Series, will be on Wednesday and Thursday, and they'll be the first ever regular-season games to be played in Korea.
ABC7 is covering the Dodgers in Korea! Rob Fukuzaki is in Seoul and will report on Shohei Ohtani's debut and much more as the Dodgers begin a season with high expectations.

North Korea Pictures Show Test of Nuclear-Capable Rockets,"North Korean state media has published photos showing the country's armed forces firing multiple short-range missiles Pyongyang says are capable of delivering nuclear warheads.
The drill, which involved ""super-sized"" multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), was carried Monday out to test the platform's capabilities through its ""sudden maneuverability and salvos"" of its 600-millimeter rockets, the state-run Rodong Sinmun wrote.
The exercise also marked the fifth occasion Kim Jong Un was reported attending a military exercise in the last two weeks. Other recent North Korean exercises coincided with operation Freedom Shield, an annual drill led by South Korea and the U.S. that concluded March 14.
1 of 3
According to the images released Monday, North Korean forces fired at least one volley of six missiles from wheeled transporter erector launchers seen at the site. Fire and smoke can be seen rising from islands apparently targeted in the exercise.
Kim ""called for fully preparing long-range artillerymen as the main combatants and main forces of war to annihilate the enemy without hesitation according to their duty,"" according to Rodong Sinmun.
Pyongyang has previously said it can fit the rockets with nuclear warheads, per North Korea-focused analysis website NK News.
The North Korean embassy in Beijing and the South Korean embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to written requests for comment.
There is a very limited window for intercepting such rockets, Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told NK News Tuesday.
They could reach the South Korean capital of Seoul within ""a couple minutes"" of being launched from North Korea.
Monday's drill unfolded amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, which are at their highest level in decades.
Recent actions by Kim's government indicate a change of direction following a short-lived thaw in relations in the late 2010s.
This March 18 photo shows the simultaneous launch by North Korean forces of six 600-millimeter rockets. Advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities have heightened concerns in South Korea.

Advances in North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities, along with live fire exercises near South Korean territory, have heightened concerns in the South.
In November, North Korea defied United Nations Security Council resolutions by launching its first spy satellite, claiming it was essential for defense purposes and promising to launch three more within the year.
Seoul retaliated by suspending parts of a North-South military accord aimed at lowering the risk of conflict and reinstated aerial surveillance across the Military Demarcation Line that divides the two nations. North Korea then withdrew from the 2018 agreement completely.
In January, the North amended its constitution to declare South Korea the ""principal enemy"" and stepped up its purge of symbols of inter-Korean cooperation.",2024-03-19T15:07:58Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Dodgers vs. Padres in Korea: Everything to know as 2024 MLB regular season kicks off with Seoul Series,"For the first time ever, Major League Baseball regular-season games will be played in South Korea. The NL West rival Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will begin the 2024 season with a pair of games in Seoul, South Korea, starting on Wednesday. The games will be played at the Gocheok Sky Dome, home of the Korea Baseball Organization's Kiwoom Heroes.
""I'm really looking forward to it, learning more about the culture, the city,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said at the Winter Meetings in December. ""Obviously there's a lot of good ball players there, and so for us and the Padres to go over there and showcase and play two regular-season games, it's good for baseball. I'm excited.""
This is the first time MLB will open the regular season with games played internationally since 2019, when the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners began the year in Tokyo. Those two games are notable for being the final two games of Ichiro Suzuki's Hall of Fame career. Here are the details for the two-game Seoul Series:

Both games will start at 7:05 p.m. local time in Seoul, so they're night games in South Korea and early-morning games in the United States. The Dodgers and Padres each played a pair of exhibition games against KBO clubs and Team Korea this past weekend to prepare for the Seoul Series. Both teams have also participated in youth clinics and other promotional events in recent days.
The Padres will serve as the home team on March 20, and the Dodgers will serve as the home team on March 21. Here are six things to know for MLB's first-ever Seoul Series.
1. Park will throw out the first pitch
Chan-Ho Park, the first Korean-born player in MLB history and also a former Dodger and Padre, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to the March 20 season opener.
Park, 50, made his MLB debut with the Dodgers in April 1994. He was an All-Star with Los Angeles in 2001 and he played parts of 17 seasons in the big leagues with seven different teams. Park went 124-98 with a 4.36 ERA in 1,993 MLB innings.
Park has been a special advisor in San Diego's front office since 2017.
2. It's a homecoming for Kim
Ha-seong Kim SD • SS • #7 2023 stats BA 0.260 R 84 HR 17 RBI 60 SB 38 View Profile
Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim was born and raised just outside Seoul and, in addition to returning to his home country, is also returning to his home ballpark for the Seoul Series. He starred for the Kiwoom Heroes (previously Nexen Heroes) from 2014-20 and the Gocheok Sky Dome was his home stadium. Expect Kim to receive a hero's welcome at his old stomping grounds.
""I don't have a specific favorite moment,"" Kim told MLB.com last summer when asked about his time as a KBO player. ""I remember all the games I played there. I can recall everything. I would say all the moments were great. I played hard and I'm proud of it.""
It should be noted that the Gocheok Sky Dome has been upgraded this season. The building has new lights, new turf, and renovated clubhouses, among other things.
With the Heroes, Kim was a three-time Golden Glove winner, which is given annually to the best all-around player at each position. It's not strictly a defensive award. Kim, who is now playing shortstop for San Diego, authored a .294/.373/.493 batting line in seven KBO seasons. He signed a four-year, $28 million contract with the Padres in January 2021 and will be a free agent after 2024.
3. Each team will bring extra players
This is not exactly a surprise. The Dodgers and Padres will use a standard 26-man roster for the two Seoul Series games, though each team brought five extra players on the trip as potential injury replacements and also to play in those two exhibition games leading up to the Seoul Series. Here are the 31 players the Dodgers took to South Korea:
There was some question about whether Blake Treinen, who took a comebacker to the midsection last week, would be healthy enough to make the trip, but he is indeed on the travel roster. Treinen did not pitch at all last season as he recovered from shoulder surgery.
Now here are the 31 players the Padres have on the trip:
Note that Dylan Cease, who came over from the Chicago White Sox in a trade last week, is on the travel roster, though he is not scheduled to pitch. He had to fly to Seoul later after being traded too late to make the team charter.
4. A starter could pitch in relief
Michael King SD • RP • #34 2023 stats ERA 2.75 WHIP 1.15 IP 104.2 BB 32 K 127 View Profile
Padres manager Mike Shildt said Michael King, who will be part of the rotation this season, will be available out of the bullpen for the Seoul Series. It's a two-game series with a seven-day break until the next regular-season game, so King won't be needed to start a third game because there is no third game in this series. Using him out of the bullpen makes perfect sense.
""I was pumped (when I was told I would be used out of the bullpen in Seoul),"" King told MLB.com recently. ""Because I really just want to pitch in that atmosphere. I'm sure it would've been a great atmosphere if I started one of those exhibition games (against a KBO team). But when the games matter, you want to pitch in the games that matter.""
Pitching out of the bullpen will be nothing new for King, who came over from the New York Yankees in the Juan Soto trade. From 2022 through mid-August 2023, King was a dynamic setup man for New York, throwing 116 innings with 143 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA. He then moved to the rotation and had a 1.88 ERA in eight starts to close out 2023.
5. More international games are coming
The Seoul Series is part of MLB's international push. It is neither the first nor the last set of international games MLB will play in 2024. The Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays played two exhibition games in the Dominican Republic on March 9 and 10. Here's the rest of 2024's international slate:
Dates Location Teams March 20-21 Seoul, South Korea Dodgers vs. Padres March 24-25 Mexico City, Mexico Yankees vs. Diablos Rojos del Mexico (exhibition games) April 27-28 Mexico City, Mexico Houston Astros vs. Colorado Rockies June 8-9 London, England New York Mets vs. Philadelphia Phillies
The two Yankees vs. Diablo Rojos games are exhibition games (Diablo Rojos are the Yankees of the Mexican League in terms of championships, historic significance, etc.). All the other international series listed above are regular-season games, though Seoul is the only new location. MLB has already played regular-season games in Mexico City and London.
6. The Dodgers and Padres still have to finish spring training
After the Seoul Series, the Dodgers and Padres will head to Southern California and wrap up their exhibition season. It's a long trip with a big-time change – a 13 or so hour flight from spring training in Phoenix to Seoul and a 16-hour time difference – and the two teams will have several days to adjust back to normal after the two games. Here are their upcoming schedules:
Dodgers Padres March 20-21 Seoul Series Seoul Series March 22-23 Off Off March 24 Exhibition game vs. Angels at Dodger Stadium Off March 25 Exhibition game vs. Angels at Dodger Stadium Exhibition game vs. Mariners at Petco Park March 26 Exhibition game vs. Angels at Angel Stadium Exhibition game vs. Mariners at Petco Park March 27 Off Off March 28 Opening Day vs. Cardinals at Dodger Stadium Opening Day vs. Giants at Petco Park
So that's two regular-season games in Seoul, a few days off, the last few spring exhibition games, another day off, and then a return to regular-season baseball. An unusual schedule, to be sure, but a necessary one given the travel involved.",2024-03-19T13:33:11Z,https://www.cbssports.com,CBS Sports
Russia's Putin to visit China in May,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to China in May for talks with Xi Jinping, in what could be the Kremlin chief’s first overseas trip of his new presidential term, according to five sources familiar with the matter.
Western governments on Monday condemned Putin’s re-election as unfair and undemocratic. But China, India and North Korea congratulated the veteran leader on extending his rule by a further six years, highlighting geopolitical fault lines that have widened since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
“Putin will visit China,” one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The details were independently confirmed by four other sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

Another of the sources said Putin’s trip to China would probably take place in the second half of May. Two of the sources said the Putin visit would come before Xi’s planned trip to Europe.
The Kremlin, when asked about the Reuters report, said information on Putin’s visits would be released closer to the date.
“Several presidential visits and several high-level contacts are being prepared at the moment,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We will inform you as we get closer.”
China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.
The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat while U.S. President Joe Biden argues that this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies.
Putin and Xi share a broad world view, which sees the West as decadent and in decline just as China challenges U.S. supremacy in everything from quantum computing and synthetic biology to espionage and hard military power.
Putin and Xi
China has strengthened its trade and military ties with Russia in recent years as the United States and its allies imposed sanctions against both countries, particularly Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine.

Foreign diplomats and observers said they expected Putin to make China his first stop after being re-elected. Putin’s formal presidential inauguration is due to take place around May 7.
Putin told reporters on Sunday that Russia and China shared a similar global outlook and enjoyed resilient relations in part due to his good personal relations with Xi, and that Moscow and Beijing would develop ties further in coming years.
Xi visited Russia in his first post-pandemic overseas trip in March last year, shortly after commencing his precedent-breaking third term as Chinese president.
The two leaders have often touted their close personal friendship and have met over 40 times, most recently in October when Putin was the guest of honour at China’s Belt and Road summit in Beijing.
Advertisement
China-Russia trade hit $218.2 billion during January-November, according to Chinese customs data, exceeding a goal to increase bilateral trade to over $200 billion by 2024 that was set by the two countries.
Xi, in a call with Putin last month, said both sides should resolutely oppose interference in domestic affairs by external forces, indicating the U.S.
Chinese vice foreign minister Sun Weidong said bilateral ties were “at their best in history” when meeting his Russian counterpart in Moscow last month, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
China is considering taking part in a peace conference aimed at ending the war in Ukraine to be hosted by neutral Switzerland in the coming months, its ambassador to Bern told local media on Monday.

Beijing launched a 12-point Ukraine “peace” plan last year but so far has not taken significant steps to resolve the conflict besides attending Western-led peace talks in Jeddah last summer.

"Ex K-pop star leaves jail after five-year rape, spycam term","AFP takes a look at the highlights since the libertarian leader took office on December 10, vowing to halt an ""orgy of public spending"".
- The chainsaw -
Before the election in which he trounced Argentina's traditional political parties, Milei would campaign with a powered-up chainsaw to symbolize his plans to cut a bloated state.
Once in office, he cut the cabinet in half to nine ministries, slashed 50,000 public jobs, suspended all new public works contracts and ripped away generous fuel and transport subsidies.
The government has boasted its first budget surplus in over a decade and has won the approval of the International Monetary Fund which has a $44 billion credit program with Argentina.
""Stabilization is working, better than one originally imagined, but there are questions about governance,"" independent economist Marina Dal Poggetto said in a recent television interview.
Milei has come under fire for shutting down the state news agency and anti-discrimination agency, and removing funding for scientific research and the cinema industry.
- Political hurdles -
Legally speaking, Milei's ambitious plans have not gone according to plan.
His party is a minority in Congress, and rivals have repeatedly beaten back his flagship reforms.
The Senate last week rejected a ""mega-decree"" that seeks to alter or repeal more than 300 existing standards, such as removing rent caps and relaxing labor laws.
However, it only needs approval by one house to become law, and the decree has yet to go before the chamber of deputies.
But even if it does pass, analysts say its constitutionality is in question.
In February a separate Omnibus Law, which seeks to make changes to the economy, politics and even some aspects of private life, was thrown out by lawmakers for a rewrite.
""Milei would like to promote his political and economic project at 100 kilometers per hour, but the government's cruising speed is much lower,"" Carlos Malamud, a researcher at the Elcano Royal Institute, told AFP.
- Misery and hunger -
Milei took office warning things would get much worse for Argentines before they get better, and they have.
He started out by devaluating the peso by 54 percent, and removing price controls.
These measures, along with the removal of fuel and transport subsidies, have seen Argentines' purchasing power plummet, causing a slowdown in consumption and economic growth.
Monthly inflation is starting to cool, but annual inflation stood at 276 percent in February.
In the absence of recent official figures, a private thinktank estimated that some 57 percent of the country is now living in poverty.
Meanwhile, the government has frozen aid to some 40,000 soup kitchens pending an audit of their operations.
On Monday, police fired teargas and used water cannon against thousands protesting the austerity measures.
""The hunger in the neighborhoods is terrible. They haven't delivered goods to the soup kitchens for four months and the kids need it,"" Maria Medina, from the leftist organization Polo Obrero told AFP.
- The Pope, Trump and Israel -
Milei has not stopped courting controversy since swapping the colorful campaign trail for the presidency.
A social media junkie, he trashes his opponents online -- such as the lawmakers who ditched his reforms -- praises himself and shares bizarre memes.
He recently raised eyebrows for telling a group of high-school students that he considers abortion to be ""murder"" and banning the use of gender-inclusive language in the military and public sector.

"EMERGING MARKETS-Emerging stocks, currencies under pressure from dollar strength","Most emerging market currencies and stocks slipped on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep borrowing costs higher for longer.
The MSCI's EM stocks index fell 1% to a near two-week low, with bourses in South Korea, Hong Kong and India leading losses with a fall of 1% each. Shanghai stocks shed 0.7% on worries over the country's deepening property crisis and soft domestic demand. China is widely expected to leave benchmark lending rates unchanged on Wednesday.
The MSCI's EM currencies index fell for a sixth day in a row as the dollar continued its recent climb. Hotter-than-expected readings of the U.S. labour market and inflation in recent weeks have led investors to rein in bets of quick and large interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. ""This week's focus is on the Federal Reserve and the update on the Summary of Economic Projections, which will show higher growth and inflation for 2024,"" said Saxo Bank strategists.
""The question is whether such forecasts will be accompanied by 75 bps of rate cuts this year. We see a higher probability of U.S. Treasury yields ending the week higher, with 10-year yields resuming their rise to 4.5%."" Rising U.S. interest rates tend to pull investors towards healthier U.S. returns, in turn hurting emerging market assets.
The Turkish lira hovered near all-time lows at 32.34 per dollar ahead of a central bank meeting on Thursday. Most economists polled by Reuters expect rates to be left unchanged but see another hike later this year as inflation remains elevated. The South African rand touched a two-week low at 19.03 per dollar before easing to 18.97. Domestic inflation data, due on Wednesday, is expected to show consumer prices growing to 5.5% in February from 5.3% a month earlier.

"Miru's local partner under scrutiny over expired license, ties with blacklisted firm","This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article.
MIDTERMS. The Senate electoral reforms panel holds a hearing on the procurement providers for the 2025 elections on March 19, 2024.
St. Timothy Construction Corporation is among the three local partners of South Korea's Miru Systems. Their joint venture is tasked to deliver consequential election technology to the Philippines in 2025.
MANILA, Philippines – Documentary records of a local company that is part of the joint venture that won the biggest election contract for the 2025 midterms are ringing alarm bells among Philippine senators.
That firm is named St. Timothy Construction Corporation, which is among the three local partners of Miru Systems, the South Korean poll technology firm that will provide the Commission on Elections (Comelec) with 110,000 automated counting machines next year.
During a Senate electoral reforms panel hearing on Tuesday, March 19, chairperson Senator Imee Marcos said St. Timothy Construction Corporation’s license has expired, citing its records from the website of the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board.
She and Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel also questioned why a construction firm would be involved in the joint venture on deployment of election technology.
“In the articles of incorporation of St. Timothy, it is clear that its role is construction and general contracting,” Marcos said. “At no point is there anything in the primary purpose of the articles of incorporation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that they would have anything to do with election exercises. Did they change that?”
A representative from Miru Systems said St. Timothy Construction Corporation will be a “financial supporter” in the joint venture.
Marcos, however, was also perplexed how assets supposedly reached P3.6 billion in 2022, from their capital of P14 million in 2014, based on documents she obtained.
“Clearly, there is a sudden infusion of money into the company immediately after the pandemic. My question is: Who infused this cash and why? Was it the alleged owner Ms. Rimando? And where did she get this money from, virtually overnight?” Marcos asked.
Senator Risa Hontiveros also questioned the ties of St. Timothy Construction Corporation to St. Gerrard Construction General Contractor & Development Corporation, a business that has been blacklisted by the Department of Public Works and Highways.
“The two companies also share a common incorporator – a certain Pacifico F. Discaya II. Was St. Timothy incorporated to circumvent the blacklisting of St. Gerrard?” Hontiveros asked in a privilege speech on Monday, March 18.
Marcos said St. Timothy Construction Corporation sent a representative to the hearing, but later “disappeared.” This meant no officer of the company answered the senators’ queries.
This prompted the panel to subpoena the company. This will compel the firm to face the senators in the next hearing that will be scheduled by Marcos’ committee.
The joint venture led by Miru secured next year’s most expensive poll contract worth P17.9 billion.
Miru, along with St. Timothy Construction Corporation, Centerpoint Solutions Technologies, and Integrated Computer Systems, will be tasked to provide the Comelec with ballot boxes, ballot paper, and canvassing system laptops and printers, on top of the new voting machines.
Miru’s technology was the subject of security concerns in countries abroad, but Miru insisted that allegations of election failures were false.
The 2025 midterms will be the first automated election in the Philippines without Smartmatic, the embattled company disqualified by the Comelec from bidding due to its alleged involvement in a 2016 bribery scheme. – Rappler.com",2024-03-19T10:24:31Z,https://www.rappler.com,Rappler

Why you should back the Dodgers
Los Angeles has arguably the best hitter in baseball in Ohtani. Famously signed in the offseason to the biggest contract in league history (10 years, $700 million), Ohtani led the majors last season in OPS (1.066). He also ranked fourth in home runs (44) despite playing just 135 games. For his efforts last year, he won the American League MVP Award.
In addition, the Dodgers dominated the head-to-head series against the Padres last season. Los Angeles won nine of the 13 games between the teams, outscoring San Diego 75-53 in the process. The 75 runs were the second most the Dodgers scored against any team last season. See which team to back here.
Why you should back the Padres
Darvish was excellent against the Dodgers last season. In two starts against his former team, Darvish went 1-0 with a 1.98 ERA, 0.732 WHIP and 10 strikeouts against only one walk in 13.2 innings. During spring training he was excellent, with a 1.07 WHIP and 2.89 ERA.
In addition, rookie center fielder Jackson Merrill brings a hot bat into the regular season. The 20-year-old Merrill hit .351 during spring training, while also posting a .995 OPS, two home runs and six RBI. He is set to become just the third player in MLB history to start Opening Day in center field before turning 21 years old, joining Ken Griffey Jr. and Andruw Jones. See which team to back here.

"Dodgers vs. Padres time, TV channel, live stream, odds: Watch MLB opener in Korea as Shohei Ohtani debuts","The 2024 MLB regular season begins Wednesday on the other side of the world. The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres kick off the new season with two games in Seoul, South Korea. These are regular-season games. They count. They are also MLB's first ever regular-season games in South Korea. This is the first time MLB will begin a new season internationally since the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners played two games in Tokyo in 2019.
The Dodgers and Padres will play the two-game Seoul Series this week, then the rest of the league will begin the regular season with the traditional Opening Day next week, on Thursday, March 28. Here's how you can watch the Seoul Series opener.
Dodgers vs. Padres time, info
Date: Wednesday, March 20 | Time: 6:05 a.m. ET (3:05 a.m. PT)
Location: Gocheok Sky Dome (Seoul, South Korea)
TV channel: ESPN, SportsNet LA, Padres TV | Live stream: fuboTV (try for free)
Probable pitchers: RHP Tyler Glasnow (Dodgers) vs. RHP Yu Darvish (Padres)
Odds: LAD -205 | SD +170 | O/U: 8.5
Storylines
Dodgers: The Shohei Ohtani era begins. Los Angeles gave Ohtani a record 10-year, $700 million contract over the winter (with heavy deferrals), and although he will not pitch this season as he works his way back from September elbow surgery, Ohtani will hit, and he has hit a lot this spring. Manager Dave Roberts will have three MVPs atop his lineup: Mookie Betts, Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman. It gets no tougher than that for opposing pitchers. Also, Yoshinobu Yamamoto will make his MLB debut in Game 2 of the Seoul Series on Thursday. For any other team, Yamamoto would have been the marquee offseason addition, but he's second fiddle to Ohtani with the Dodgers. Los Angeles gave Yamamoto, a reigning three-time MVP in Japan, the richest pitching contract in baseball history this offseason: 12 years and $325 million. The Dodgers will show off all their new toys in Seoul this week.
Padres: At the end of last year, the Padres were one of the biggest disappointments in baseball, going 82-80 and missing the postseason despite the sport's third largest payroll. They cut back on spending this offseason, most notably trading Juan Soto and his $31 million salary, but the Padres still expect to contend in 2024. A wild-card spot is within reach and they do get to build their offense around Fernando Tatis Jr., Manny Machado, and Xander Bogaerts. That's a pretty strong core even if it's not Betts, Ohtani, and Freeman. San Diego will start Darvish and Joe Musgrove in Seoul. The rotation behind the two veteran stalwarts and the recently acquired Dylan Cease is a bit shaky. Pitchers like Pedro Avila, Jhony Brito, Michael King, and Randy Vásquez will help decide whether the Padres have a bounce-back season, or fall short of the postseason once again.
Prediction
The Dodgers take the Seoul Series opener behind Glasnow thanks of course -- of course -- to an Ohtani home run. The man has a flair for the dramatic. Dodgers 7, Padres 2",2024-03-19T10:00:46Z,https://www.cbssports.com,CBS Sports
South Korea to suspend licenses of 2 senior doctors in first punishments over walkout,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean authorities will suspend the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations, one of the doctors said Monday.
The impending suspensions are the first punishments against physicians after more than 90% of the country’s 13,000 doctors-in-training walked off the job last month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.
Officials say the recruitment plan is aimed at adding more doctors to prepare for South Korea’s rapidly aging population in a country whose doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.
In early March, the government began taking steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors after they refused its orders to return to work by the end of February. Police are separately investigating five senior members of the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, for allegedly inciting and abetting the strikes.
Park Myung-Ha, one of the five members, said he received a government-sent letter saying that his license will be suspended for three months starting April 15. Park, who works for the KMA’s emergency committee, said committee leader Kim Taek-woo was also given a three-month suspension.
The Health Ministry said it would not confirm any reported administrative steps imposed on individual doctors.
“My fellow doctors and I are really angered and appalled by the government’s measure,” Park told The Associated Press.
Park accused the government of attempting to break up the KMA emergency committee and sending a warning message to striking junior doctors. He said he and others are discussing legal steps to respond to the license suspensions.
About 12,000 junior doctors have been off the job for a month, but none has received a license suspension. Observers have said it would take a few months to suspend all their licenses and that the government would most likely end up suspending only strike leaders.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Their strikes have caused hundreds of canceled or postponed surgeries and other treatments, but officials say the country’s handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will most likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would severely burden South Korea’s medical services.
In a briefing earlier Monday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo urged senior doctors to cancel their plans and persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.
“Under any circumstances, you must not use the lives of the people for negotiations,” Park said.
In early February, the government said it would increase the country’s medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show a majority of the South Korean public supports the government’s recruitment plan. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.",2024-03-19T09:38:43Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
North Korea says Kim Jong Un supervised tests of rocket launchers targeting Seoul,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable “super-large” multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea’s capital as he vowed to strengthen his war deterrent in the face of deepening confrontations with rivals, state media said Tuesday.

The report came a day after South Korea and Japan said they detected North Korea firing multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward waters off its eastern coast, adding to a streak of weapons displays that have raised regional tensions.
Experts say North Korea’s large-sized artillery rockets blur the boundaries between artillery systems and ballistic missiles because they can create their own thrust and are guided during delivery. The North has described some of these systems, including the 600mm multiple rocket launchers that were tested Monday, as capable of delivering tactical nuclear warheads.
Photos published by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency showed at least six rockets being fired simultaneously from launch vehicles and flames and smoke blanketing what appeared to be a small island target.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said later Tuesday that it assesses North Korea conducted more launches than what was shown in the photos. Lt. Col. Lee Chang-hyun, a deputy JCS spokesperson, said that South Korea categorizes the North Korean weapons system tested Monday as a ballistic missile in view of its characteristics and capacities.
KCNA also said North Korean troops in a separate test simulated exploding an artillery shell at a preset altitude. The report did not specify whether that test was to rehearse how a nuclear weapon would be detonated over an enemy target.

Kim called the 600mm multiple rocket launchers key parts of his arsenal of weapons that are supposedly capable of destroying Seoul if another war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.
“(Kim) said that it is necessary to further impress upon the enemies that if an armed conflict and a war break out, they can never avoid disastrous consequences,” the KCNA said. He called for his army to “more thoroughly fulfill their missions to block and suppress the possibility of war with the constant perfect preparedness to collapse the capital of the enemy and the structure of its military forces.”
Lee, the South Korean deputy spokesperson, said South Korea and the United States have been bolstering their response capabilities against North Korea’s increasing nuclear threats.
North Korea’s launches came days after the end of the latest U.S.-South Korean combined military drills that the North portrays as an invasion rehearsal. It was unclear whether the North timed the launches with a visit to Seoul by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who on Monday attended a democracy summit and held talks with South Korean officials about the North Korean threat.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen since 2022, after Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and updating their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the U.S. and South Korea.
In a fiery speech to Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament in January, Kim declared that he was abandoning North Korea’s long-standing goal of reconciliation with the South and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to cement its war-divided rival as its most hostile adversary. He said the new charter must specify that North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.",2024-03-19T09:21:01Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
Kim Jong Un oversees 'super-large' rocket launcher firing drills,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a firing drill of super-large multiple rocket launcher systems, state media reported Tuesday. Photo by KCNA/UPI
SEOUL, March 19 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a firing drill of ""super-large multiple rocket launchers,"" state media reported Tuesday, an exercise that South Korea had described as a short-range ballistic missile launch a day earlier. The drill, held Monday in the west of the country, was ""aimed at proving the might and the real war capabilities of the weapon system through the sudden maneuvers and salvos of 600mm multiple rocket sub-units,"" state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.

Images released by KCNA showed six batteries of rocket launchers firing simultaneously.
The United States and South Korea refer to the North's super-large multiple-launch rocket system as the KN-25 and analysts characterize it as a short-range ballistic missile. North Korea has claimed since October 2022 that the weapon can be fitted with a tactical nuclear warhead.
The exercises included hitting targets in the sea and simulating the midair detonation of a shell at a preset altitude, KCNA said.
Kim called the artillery units ""the main combatants and the mainstay of war to annihilate the enemy without hesitation,"" according to KCNA.
""The destructive offensive means possessed by our army should more thoroughly fulfill their missions to block and deter the risks of war with the constant perfect preparedness to destroy the capital of the enemy and the structure of its military forces,"" Kim said.

South Korea's military said Monday that it had detected the launch of multiple projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles. The missiles were fired from the Pyongyang area and traveled roughly 185 miles before landing in the East Sea, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
The launch came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Seoul for a democracy summit and followed days after the United States and South Korea wrapped up a large-scale joint military exercise.
The ballistic missile launch was the first by North Korea since Jan. 14, when it tested what it said was a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile.
Pyongyang has also fired several rounds of cruise missiles since the beginning of the year and has kept up a steady stream of threats and military exercises, including recent visits by leader Kim Jong Un to live-fire artillery drills and tank combat training.",2024-03-19T09:00:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

Zuletzt wurde befürchtet, dass Microsoft den Hardwaremarkt komplett verlassen könnte und die Xbox Series X|S die letzte Konsole ihrer Art sein wird. Stattdessen kündigte Microsoft eine komplett neue Xbox-Hardware für dieses Jahr an, ohne jedoch genaue Details zu verraten.
Xbox Dev-Kit mit Hinweis auf neue Konsole?
Laut einem Bericht von Xbox News Korea wurde ein brandneues Xbox Dev-Kit bei der South Korea National Radio Research Agency zertifiziert, das unter der Modellnummer 2089 läuft. Das ursprünglich Dev-Kit mit der Nummer 2081 tauchte dort ebenfalls wenige Monate vor dem Launch der Konsole auf.

Um was für ein Dev-Kit es sich dabei handelt, kann nur spekuliert werden. Bisher ging man davon aus, dass Microsoft auf ein Mid-Gen-Refresh bei der Xbox Series X|S verzichtet. Stattdessen wurde eine Xbox Series X|S All-Digital Edition geleakt, die jedoch kein separates Dev-Kit voraussetzen sollte. Für eine brandneue Xbox erscheint es zudem noch zu früh, weshalb die Idee zu einem Mid-Gen-Refresh der Xbox Series X|S vielleicht doch nicht ganz vom Tisch ist.
PS5 Pro gegen Xbox Series Z?
Das könnte vor dem Hintergrund der PS5 Pro entschieden worden sein, an der Sony nach all den Berichten der letzten Tage mit ziemlicher Sicherheit arbeitet. Sollte Microsoft dieser nichts entgegenzusetzen haben, wird es die Xbox Series X|S in dieser Generation nur noch schwerer haben.
Laut aktuellen Meldungen verteilt Sony derzeit die finalen Dev-Kits der PS5 Pro an Entwickler, die voraussichtlich im Herbst auf den Markt kommen wird. Gegenüber der Basis PS5 verfügt die PS5 Pro über mehr Performance, mehr Grafikmöglichkeiten, besseres Raytracing und erste KI-Features wie Spectral Super Resolution. Ziel damit ist es, konstante 4K-Auflösungen bei gleichzeitig hohen Framerates und Raytracing nutzen zu können, während später bis zu 8K oder 120fps möglich sein sollen.

The M.L.B. Season Opens in South Korea. Here’s What to Know.,"In the United States, many Major League Baseball games feature long periods of calm, punctuated by cheering when there’s action on the field or the stadium organ plays a catchy tune.
But in South Korea, a baseball game is a sustained sensory overload. Each player has a fight song, and cheering squads — including drummers and dancers who stand on platforms near the dugouts facing the spectators — ensure that there is near-constant chanting. Imagine being at a ballpark where every player, even a rookie, gets the star treatment.
“You should get ready to scream,” said Kim Seongjun, 26, a fan who attended an exhibition game in Seoul over the weekend. “It’s fun to get on your feet and cheer.”
Also, the food is on another level. Think of the ballpark as a giant buffet of Korean street food.

SEOUL, South Korea (KABC) -- The excitement is building as the Dodgers and Padres prepare to play MLB's first regular-season games in Seoul, South Korea.
The Dodgers beat South Korea's national team, 5-2 in their exhibition matchup Monday. For most fans around the world, Shohei Ohtani's debut in Dodger blue is the story to watch, but the amount of media attention surrounding the series and the players is quite unbelievable.
On Tuesday (in Seoul), the Dodgers held an optional workout, which gave some of the players some time to relax.
The team flew to Seoul last week and is doing all they can to get on a consistent clock. It wasn't easy following a 13-hour flight and a 16-hour time difference, and the Padres are on the same boat.
Dodgers right-hander Tyler Glasnow shared more about being named the Opening Day starter and his experience in Seoul so far.
""We got used to the time change and like, slept on the flight, and they gave us some pointers and all that stuff,"" he said. ""As far as like actual preparation, it's just normal. It's just like two extra days. It's been awesome. The atmosphere has been great. It's been very electric.""
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Ohtani - ruled out this year as a pitcher after his second surgery on his right elbow - will soon start a throwing program that might allow him to play in the field this season.
""Shohei this year is primarily going to be the designated hitter,"" Roberts said. ""Once we get back to the States, he is going to start his throwing program, which he hasn't started yet, We'll see how that progression goes. If his arm is healthy enough, we'll have that conversation in the field. I do know he's not going to pitch this year.""
It's the first sign that Ohtani may do more than just DH after signing a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers. Of course, when he might play in the field is unclear - or if it happens at all.
The ""Seoul Series"" two-game set between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will be broadcast on ESPN.

Xbox Series X: Neue Konsole im Anflug? Dev-Kit in Korea registriert!,"Die Anzeichen scheinen sich weiter zu verdichten, dass Microsoft tatsächlich eine neue Xbox-Konsole womöglich noch in diesem Jahr veröffentlichen könnte. In Korea wurde nun ein neues Dev-Kit registriert.
Bereits im Februar berichtete die Gerüchteküche über eine geplante Revision der Xbox Series X. Demnach soll sich ein komplett in weiß gehaltenes, rein digitales Modell der leistungsstärkeren Xbox Series X in Arbeit befinden, das voraussichtlich im Sommer 2024 veröffentlicht werden soll. Offiziell bestätigt ist das seitens Microsoft noch nicht, die Anzeichen, dass es tatsächlich so kommen könnte, verdichten sich jedoch weiter.
Im fernen Korea nämlich wurde nun ein neue Xbox Dev-Kit offiziell bei den Behörden angemeldet und von diesen freigegeben. Wie Xbox News for Koreans berichtet, wurde die Entwicklervariante einer Xbox-Konsole mit der Modellnummer 2089 am 18. März 2024 von den zuständigen Behörden abgenickt und kann dort nun genutzt werden. Hergestellt worden sei das Dev-Kit demnach in China und Vietnam.
Nach koreanischem Recht müssen alle elektronischen Geräte von der National Radio Research Agency zertifiziert werden, um Störungen der Radiowellen ausschließen zu können. Erst mit dieser Zertifizierung dürfen die Geräte auch tatsächlich in Korea genutzt werden - so auch Dev-Kits. Mit der Freigabe können koreanische Entwickler nun mit dem neuen Dev-Kit von Microsoft arbeiten. Es sei wahrscheinlich, dass solche Dev-Kits nun zeitnah an die koreanischen Studios ausgereicht werden.
Die Chancen dürften nicht ganz schlecht stehen, dass das neue Dev-Kit tatsächlich eine Revision der Xbox Series X vorbereiten könnte, offiziell gesichert ist das aber bis dato noch nicht.

South Korea suspends 2 doctors’ licences over walkouts,"SEOUL - South Korea has suspended the medical licences of two doctors, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) said on March 19, in the first punitive action over a month-long strike that has caused healthcare chaos.
Thousands of junior doctors stopped working on Feb 20 to protest against government reforms aimed at creating more medics to end shortages and deal with a rapidly ageing population, forcing hospitals to cancel crucial treatments and operations, including chemotherapy and caesarean sections.
The government has repeatedly urged doctors to return to their patients, warning of legal action for non-compliance, but the stand-off has spiralled, with senior doctors now threatening to join their junior colleagues and no serious talks under way.
Two officials from the KMA, which has been heavily involved in the walkout, were informed on March 18 that their licences had been suspended for three months, purportedly for instigating the strike.
“The two officials, Kim Taek-woo and Park Myung-ha, received the notice yesterday,” spokesperson Lee Seok-young told AFP.
A health ministry spokesperson told AFP that the government would not provide confirmation regarding the specific administrative actions taken against individual physicians.
The KMA has previously accused the government of using “intimidation tactics” to try to force doctors back to work, and said it was turning the country into a “totalitarian state”.
Under South Korean law, doctors are restricted from striking, and the government has requested police investigate people connected to the stoppage, including officials at the KMA.
“The government deeply regrets the current situation where even professors are considering resigning, following the footsteps of trainees,” Second Vice-Minister of Health Park Min-soo told reporters on March 19.
“Once again, the government is willing to talk to the medical community at any time without conditions,” he said, although Seoul has emphasised that abandoning the reform plan is not an option.
‘Save lives’
Seoul is pushing to admit 2,000 more students to medical schools annually from 2025 to address what it says is one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations.
Doctors say they fear the reform will erode the quality of service and medical education, but proponents of the plan accuse them of trying to safeguard their salaries and social status.
President Yoon Suk-yeol on March 19 said the reforms were necessary, and lamented the fierce opposition from physicians.",2024-03-19T05:30:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
Why MLB is hosting its first regular-season games in South Korea,"SEOUL — Watch the scene that stirred Monday afternoon here, and the homecoming that San Diego Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim cemented with a pair of home runs in his return to Gocheok Skydome, and it clicked. Said Padres manager Mike Shildt: “Can’t script it much better.”
The same goes for the club occupying the home dugout this week in Seoul. It’s been 30 years since Chan Ho Park debuted for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are in South Korea with a new traveling band of superstars that only added to the franchise’s appeal in the region. In spending more than $1 billion to acquire transcontinental superstars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, each born just a short flight away in Japan, the team has well established its place as the preeminent major-league club this side of the Pacific.
“These two teams are a perfect match,” Jeremiah Yolkut, Major League Baseball’s vice president of global events, told The Athletic ahead of the first MLB regular-season games ever in South Korea.

The opening game starts Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Korea, or 6 a.m. ET in the United States. Here’s how the teams wound up here:
What does this mean for the teams?
A project that started in earnest three to four years ago couldn’t have lined up much better.
For the Padres, Kim gets to return to the same ballpark where he starred with the Korea Baseball Organization’s Kiwoom Heroes. It also marked a chance for free-agent signee Woo Suk Go to square off in exhibition action against the same LG Twins squad he closed out a KBO title with just last season.

For the Dodgers, there’s a global stage to launch one of their most highly anticipated seasons ever and a chance to tap further into a market that, as manager Dave Roberts put it, the organization wants to “paint blue.”
How did MLB settle on Korea?
As Major League Baseball charted out its next batch of international games following the ratification of the newest collective bargaining agreement, an obvious market emerged: Asia, where the league last opened a regular season in 2019 with a Seattle Mariners–Oakland Athletics series in Tokyo.
And while a return to Japan and its vast market share made sense — and appears to be in the cards again for 2025 — South Korea, and particularly Seoul, quickly emerged as a contender.
The city, and Gocheok Skydome, had previously partnered with the league to host part of the opening rounds of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, a test case to see if the city and facility had the proper infrastructure for potential future games. Additional work continued once the selection was finalized, including refurbishing the turf fields and ensuring enough clubhouse and weight room space to house full-fledged games.
“It’s just making sure we have everything as needed so that the Dodgers and Padres really wouldn’t know the difference between playing here and playing back in the States,” Yolkut said.
GO DEEPER How KBO insider Daniel Kim helped turn Korean baseball into a worldwide pandemic sensation
How is the Korea Series being received?
Tickets to South Korea’s first major-league regular-season games reportedly sold out within an hour. Ohtani’s Dodgers debut and Kim’s return to his home ballpark were too much to resist.
But the market’s overall viability and growth, the league hopes, will be spotlighted over the entire week, with Yolkut pointing to the exhibitions each team played against the Heroes, Twins and Team Korea over the past few days as an example.

When Heroes right-hander Ariel Jurado, who pitched parts of three seasons in the majors with the Texas Rangers and New York Mets, struck out Ohtani twice in his exhibition, he hoped scouts were able to watch. When Kiwoom third baseman Sung Mun Song drove a two-run double off the wall in his taste of major-league action, he called it “the best day ever of my life,” according to a live translation. Roberts raved about Dodgers scouts’ evaluation of Team Korea second baseman Hye Seong Kim, who could be on big-league teams’ radar as soon as this winter.
The hope, Yolkut said, is to use it as a potential jumping-off point for not just drawing attention to the games, but forming connections with the local fan base so they continue following Major League Baseball.
“We just need more and more appetite for baseball in this market both from a live event perspective and wanting us to be here, but also from merchandise sales, business sales and watching our games on the different platforms,” Yolkut said. “We can do that in this country. So it continues to be a market that’s burgeoning. A lot more, they want to be a part of it so we want to keep that relationship close.”
Will MLB play more games in Korea?
This will be a test case. But if the first few days in Seoul are any indication, it could be a market the league returns to as it cycles through international sites.
“As you could tell with the energy already we’re seeing in the market, the arrival at the airport, what we’re seeing around the city and people at the hotels, watching the players come in and out of the hotels, they just want more,” Yolkut said. “So I definitely think Korea will be in the running as we look at what the play plan will look like in the future.”

South Korea will suspend licenses of 2 senior doctors in first punishment for doctors' walkouts,"South Korean authorities will suspend the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations, one of the doctors said Monday.
The impending suspensions are the punishments against physicians after more than 90% of the country's 13,000 doctors-in-training walked off the job last month to protest the government's plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.
Officials say the recruitment plan is aimed at adding more doctors to prepare for South Korea's rapidly aging population in a country whose doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can't handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country's medical services.
In early March, the government began taking steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors after they refused its orders to return to work by the end of February. Police are separately investigating five senior members of the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, for allegedly inciting and abetting the strikes.
Park Myung-Ha, one of the five members, said he received a government-sent letter saying that his license will be suspended for three months from April 15. Park, who works for the KMA's emergency committee, said committee leader Kim Taek-woo was also given a three-month suspension.
The Health Ministry said it wouldn't confirm any reported administrative steps imposed on individual doctors.
""My fellow doctors and I are really angered and appalled by the government's measure,"" Park told The Associated Press.
Park accused the government of attempting to break up the KMA emergency committee and sending a warning message to striking junior doctors. He said he and others are discussing legal steps to respond to the license suspensions.
About 12,000 junior doctors have been off the job for a month, but none has received a license suspension. Observers have said it would take a few months to suspend all their licenses and that the government would likely end up suspending only strike leaders.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea's 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Their strikes have caused hundreds of canceled or postponed surgeries and other treatments, but officials say the country's handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would burden South Korea's medical services severely.
In a briefing earlier Monday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo urged senior doctors to cancel their plans and persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.
""Under any circumstances, you must not use the lives of the people for negotiations,"" Park said.
In early February, the government said it would increase the country's medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show a majority of the South Korean public support the government's recruitment plan. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.

Kim oversees 'super large' N Korea rocket launcher drills,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw firing drills involving ""newly-equipped super-large"" multiple rocket launchers, state media said, a day after Seoul said Pyongyang had fired several short-range ballistic missiles.
The United States and South Korea wrapped up one of their major annual joint military exercises last week, prompting angry retorts and live-fire drills from nuclear-armed Pyongyang, which condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion.
Seoul's military said yesterday it had detected the launch of ""multiple short-range ballistic missiles"" by the North, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the South Korean capital for talks.
The super-large multiple rocket launcher, referred to as KN-25 by the Seoul-Washington military, is a short-range ballistic missile, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (C) visiting a military training base in North Korea earlier this month
The North has claimed the weapon has the capability to be equipped with a tactical nuclear warhead.
Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Mr Kim guided the drills yesterday that tested the ""real war capabilities"" of 600 millimetre multiple rocket launchers as he stressed the importance of ""war preparations"".
The drills also involved simulating an aerial explosion of a shell from the super-large multiple rocket launcher at a predetermined altitude above the target, KNCA said.
Mr Kim said the multiple rocket launcher would help the North ""block and suppress the possibility of war with the constant perfect preparedness to collapse the capital of the enemy"".
During the drills, North Korean artillerymen ""demonstrated their excellent crack-shot artillery marksmanship and prompt and thorough combat readiness,"" it added.
""Massive shells of super-large multiple rocket launchers, which were fired from the sharp gun barrels like lava, flew to the target with the flame of annihilating the enemy,"" it said.
State media images showed Mr Kim, wearing his customary black leather jacket, watching the drills with his generals and celebrating their apparent success with a raised fist.
Pyongyang this month warned that Seoul and Washington would pay a ""dear price"" over their military exercises, and later announced that Mr Kim had guided an artillery unit it says was capable of striking the South Korean capital.
Mr Kim last week also oversaw paratroop drills aimed at showing his soldiers' ability to occupy an ""enemy region at a stroke"", according to state media.
Yesterday's ballistic missile test was the North's second this year, after Pyongyang launched one tipped with a manoeuvrable hypersonic warhead on 14 January.
So far this year, the nuclear-armed North has declared South Korea its ""principal enemy"", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over ""even 0.001 mm"" of territorial infringement.
Seoul is one of Washington's key regional allies, and the United States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South to help protect it against Pyongyang.
Last week's Washington-Seoul drills included ""clearing operations"" inside North Korea's ""key facilities"" in case of an attack by Pyongyang, according to Seoul's military.",2024-03-19T00:00:00Z,https://www.rte.ie,RTE.ie

SEOUL (KABC) -- Some Dodgers fans woke up early Monday morning for some overseas baseball.
The Dodgers beat South Korea's national team, 5-2 in their exhibition matchup, ahead of Wednesday's season opener.
We're also seeing the team have a little fun on their trip! From enjoying the local street food to touring palaces. They are keeping us updated along the way.
It's all building up to this Wednesday when the Dodgers take on the Padres in the ""Seoul Series"" kick-off -- the first regular-season MLB games played in South Korea.
ABC7's Rob Fukuzaki arrived in South Korea and will be covering the sights and sounds of Seoul, as well as keeping a watch on Shohei Ohtani's anticipated Dodger debut against Manny Machado and the Padres.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Ohtani - ruled out this year as a pitcher after his second surgery on his right elbow - will soon start a throwing program that might allow him to play in the field this season.
""Shohei this year is primarily going to be the designated hitter,"" Roberts said. ""Once we get back to the States, he is going to start his throwing program, which he hasn't started yet, We'll see how that progression goes. If his arm is healthy enough, we'll have that conversation in the field. I do know he's not going to pitch this year.""
It's the first sign that Ohtani may do more than just DH after signing a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers. Of course, when he might play in the field is unclear - or if it happens at all.
The ""Seoul Series"" two-game set between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will be broadcast on ESPN.

Leder: Putins valg: Krig og undertrykkelse,"Vladimir Putin mottar begeistrede gratulasjoner fra Kina, Iran og Nord-Korea for valgseieren. At undertrykkende regimer hyller Putin er like forventet som resultatet i det russiske presidentvalget.
Nesten ni av ti russere stemte på Putin, ifølge myndighetene. Det er som forventet når det ikke finnes reelle motkandidater og opposisjonsledere er kneblet, fengslet eller døde.
Vi må konstatere at situasjonen i Russland er bekmørk. Det eneste lyspunktet er de modige russere som viser at det finnes en opposisjon, til tross for truslene om harde straffereaksjoner.

Det er ti år siden Putins aggresjon mot Ukraina startet med okkupasjonen av Krim. Da Putin ble gjenvalgt i 2018 trodde likevel de færreste at han fire år senere skulle gå til en fullskala-invasjon av Ukraina.
Vesten feilberegnet Putin og hans intensjoner. Den tiden er over. Putin tar sikte på å styre på livstid og hans plan er å gjenopprette et storrussisk rike.
Putin har, som Xi Jinping i Kina, sørget for å endre loven slik at han kan bli sittende som president på livstid. Putins femte presidentperiode går frem til 2030, da han uten opposisjon kan bli gjenvalgt for en sjette periode.
Gradvis har Russland gått i totalitær retning i løpet av Putins 24 år ved makten. Det er grunn til å frykte at seks nye år med Putin betyr enda hardere undertrykkelse internt, en tydeligere militarisering av samfunnet og en langvarig krig.
INGEN KONKURRANSE: De tre andre Kreml-godkjente kandidatene var som ventet sjanseløse og fikk bare noen få prosent oppslutning. Foto: STRINGER / AFP / NTB
For å kunne føre en langvarig krig har Putin knyttet nærmere bånd til diktaturene i Nord-Korea og Iran. Putin har gjort seg avhengig av Kinas økonomiske, teknologiske og politiske støtte.
Spørsmålet er hva Putin konkret vil gjøre i sin femte periode.
Vil han ta sjansen på å gjennomføre en upopulær mobilisering for å kunne sende enda større styrker til fronten? Vil Russland forsøke å gjennomføre en storstilt militær offensiv i Ukraina i sommer?
Hvem står for tur hvis Putin vinner frem i Ukraina? Er den neste fronten i hans imperialistiske krig Moldova? Prorussiske separatister i utbryterregionen Transnistria har bedt Moskva om «beskyttelse».
KINA GRATULERER: Kinas president Xi Jinping og Vladimir Putin i Beijing i oktober 2023. Putin er helt avhengig av Kinas økonomiske og politiske støtte. Foto: SERGEI GUNEYEV / AFP / NTB
Det er anslått at over 300.000 russiske soldater er drept eller såret i krigen i Ukraina. Et stort antall ukrainske soldater og sivile er også drept i Putins krig. Byer og landsbyer er lagt i ruiner.
Regimet har gjort det forbudt å kritisere krigen og markere motstand mot regimet. De som våger å ta til motmæle straffes hardt. Og som en advarsel til vestlige land viser Putin stadig til at Russland har verdens største arsenal av kjernefysiske våpen.
Valgresultatet var forutbestemt. Men Putin er uforutsigbar.
Det vi med sikkerhet vet er at Putin (71) og en aldrende maktelite i Kreml har ett overordnet mål. De er opptatt av å beholde makten og privilegiene, slik alle autokrater er. Det handler ikke om hva som er Russlands interesser, men hva som tjener Putins sak.",2024-03-18T19:22:49Z,https://www.vg.no,VG
"South Korean Defense Chief Says North Korea Has Supplied 7,000 Containers of Munitions to Russia","North Korea has shipped around 7,000 containers filled with munitions and other military equipment to Russia since last year to help support its war in Ukraine, South Korea’s defense minister said Monday.
Shin Won-sik shared the assessment at a news conference hours after the South Korean and Japanese militaries said the North fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters, adding to a streak of weapons displays amid growing tensions with rivals.
Since the start of 2022, North Korea has used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up its weapons tests and has also aligned with Moscow over the conflict, as leader Kim Jong Un tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and join a united front against the United States.
U.S. and South Korean officials have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment in recent months to help fuel its war on Ukraine, saying that such arms transfers accelerated after a rare summit between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin in September.
North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and military assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s forces, according to South Korean officials and private experts. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.
During a news conference in Seoul, Shin said the South Korean military believes the North, after initially relying on ships, has been increasingly using its rail networks to send arms supplies to Russia through their land border.
In exchange for sending possibly several million artillery shells and other supplies, North Korea has received more than 9,000 Russian containers likely filled with aid, Shin said. He raised suspicions that Russia could be providing North Korea with fuel, possibly in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions that tightly cap the country’s imports of oil and petroleum products.
While fuel shortages likely forced North Korea to scale back winter training activities for its soldiers in recent years, South Korea’s military assesses that the North expanded such drills this January and February, Shin said.
North Korea’s latest missile launches came days after the end of the latest South Korean-U.S. combined military drills that the North portrays as an invasion rehearsal.
Shin said the North may dial up its testing activity before the April 10 parliamentary elections in South Korea, which is shaping up as a confidence vote for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a harder line than his liberal predecessor over North Korean nuclear ambitions and threats.
Animosity between the war-divided Koreans has recently worsened, with both countries taking steps to breach a 2018 bilateral military agreement on reducing border tensions. Kim vowed in January to abandon the North’s long-standing goal of reconciliation and to rewrite its constitution to declare the South its most hostile adversary.
While most of North Korea’s recent missile tests seem aligned with its stated goals of augmenting its frontline forces with new weapons systems, the South Korean and U.S. militaries are also evaluating whether some North Korean tests are aimed at verifying the performance of weapons it intends to send to Russia, Shin said.
North Korean state media said Monday that Kim sent a message of congratulations to Putin over his reelection as Russia’s president. On Saturday, Kim’s sister issued a statement through state media saying that her brother has used a Russian luxury limousine recently gifted by Putin and praised the car’s “special function,” in another effort to boost the visibility of the countries’ bilateral ties.",2024-03-18T17:49:53Z,https://www.news18.com,News18
"People Are Confused Why ""Jeff"" Is On A List Of Nuclear Superpowers","Since the creation of nuclear weapons, we have lived in a world where an all-out war could destroy humanity many times over. Studies have found that just 100 or so warheads could plunge the world into nuclear winter, which could claim up to 1 billion lives. As of 2023, we have an approximated 12,500 nuclear warheads.
Keeping track of them is, of course, pretty important. You don't want to end up like the US, losing six nuclear weapons (that we know of).

Before the Dodgers’ Seoul Series game against the Kiwoom Heroes got underway at the Gocheok Sky Dome, the 29-year-old film star stood on the mound to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.
As Jeon readied to hurl the ball toward home plate, several members of the Dodgers appeared to take in the moment off the field, as captured on the broadcast.

The Dodgers demolished their opponent, 14-3, thanks in part to a home run by Freeman, who went 3-for-5.

Ohtani, a two-time AL MVP who spent the past six years with the Angels, will be sidelined from pitching this year following elbow surgery in September.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Ohtani, 29, will take part in a throwing program upon the team’s return to the U.S., according to the team’s official website.

On Monday, North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a move analysts interpreted as a calculated attempt to attract attention while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited South Korea for talks. Blinken, attending the third Summit for Democracy, met with President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul early Monday. He is also holding discussions with his South Korean counterpart on the sidelines of the event, with the focus now expected to be on the allies’ efforts to counter threats from the nuclear-armed North.
Last week, Washington and Seoul concluded one of their major annual joint military training exercises, leading to angry retorts and live-fire drills from nuclear-armed Pyongyang.
North Korea condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion. Seoul’s military reported that it had detected the launch of “multiple short-range ballistic missiles” early Monday. These missiles flew approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) before descending into the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.
“We are closely sharing relevant information with the US and Japan and are maintaining utmost readiness,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff added.
Spokesperson Matthew Miller stated that after meeting Yoon, Blinken “condemned the launch of ballistic missiles by the DPRK and reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to the ROK’s security.” He referred to North and South Korea by their official names. Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi reported that the North had fired three short-range ballistic missiles, which landed outside of the country and did not cause any damage.
The launches occurred just days after Seoul and Washington concluded their annual Freedom Shield drills, which this year involved double the number of troops, ending on Thursday. Pyongyang issued a warning earlier this month, stating that Seoul and Washington would pay a “dear price” over the drills. Later, North Korean leader Kim Jong UN announced that he had guided an artillery unit capable of striking the South Korean capital.

“It’s a highly calculated move timing-wise by Pyongyang to fire multiple missiles to show they are capable of doing such an act even when the top US diplomat is in town,” Professor Choi Gi-il of military studies at Sangji University said.
Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies stated that North Korea typically stages missile launches “as a tit-for-tat” after US-South Korea joint drills. He mentioned that Blinken’s presence further motivates them, as it “means more attention from Washington and adds pressure on host Seoul.” Monday’s ballistic missile test marks the North’s second this year, following Pyongyang’s launch of one tipped with a maneuverable hypersonic warhead on January 14.
Blinken arrived in South Korea on Sunday afternoon ahead of the democracy summit, which runs from March 18 to 20 and will convene government officials, NGOs, and civil society members. Seoul, one of Washington’s key regional allies, hosts approximately 27,000 American soldiers stationed in the South to assist in protecting it against the nuclear-armed North. Conservative President Yoon has strengthened ties with Washington and aimed to reconcile with former colonial power Japan to enhance defenses against Pyongyang’s threats.
So far this year, Pyongyang has declared South Korea its “principal enemy,” disbanded agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and issued threats of war over “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement.

"South Korean defense chief says North Korea has supplied 7,000 containers of munitions to Russia","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea has shipped around 7,000 containers filled with munitions and other military equipment to Russia since last year to help support its war in Ukraine, South Korea’s defense minister said Monday.
Shin Won-sik shared the assessment at a news conference hours after the South Korean and Japanese militaries said the North fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters, adding to a streak of weapons displays amid growing tensions with rivals.
Since the start of 2022, North Korea has used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up its weapons tests and has also aligned with Moscow over the conflict, as leader Kim Jong Un tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and join a united front against the United States.
U.S. and South Korean officials have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment in recent months to help fuel its war on Ukraine, saying that such arms transfers accelerated after a rare summit between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin in September.
North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and military assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s forces, according to South Korean officials and private experts. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.
During a news conference in Seoul, Shin said the South Korean military believes the North, after initially relying on ships, has been increasingly using its rail networks to send arms supplies to Russia through their land border.
In exchange for sending possibly several million artillery shells and other supplies, North Korea has received more than 9,000 Russian containers likely filled with aid, Shin said. He raised suspicions that Russia could be providing North Korea with fuel, possibly in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions that tightly cap the country’s imports of oil and petroleum products.
While fuel shortages likely forced North Korea to scale back winter training activities for its soldiers in recent years, South Korea’s military assesses that the North expanded such drills this January and February, Shin said.
North Korea’s latest missile launches came days after the end of the latest South Korean-U.S. combined military drills that the North portrays as an invasion rehearsal.
Shin said the North may dial up its testing activity before the April 10 parliamentary elections in South Korea, which is shaping up as a confidence vote for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a harder line than his liberal predecessor over North Korean nuclear ambitions and threats.
Animosity between the war-divided Koreans has recently worsened, with both countries taking steps to breach a 2018 bilateral military agreement on reducing border tensions. Kim vowed in January to abandon the North’s long-standing goal of reconciliation and to rewrite its constitution to declare the South its most hostile adversary.
While most of North Korea’s recent missile tests seem aligned with its stated goals of augmenting its frontline forces with new weapons systems, the South Korean and U.S. militaries are also evaluating whether some North Korean tests are aimed at verifying the performance of weapons it intends to send to Russia, Shin said.
North Korean state media said Monday that Kim sent a message of congratulations to Putin over his reelection as Russia’s president. On Saturday, Kim’s sister issued a statement through state media saying that her brother has used a Russian luxury limousine recently gifted by Putin and praised the car’s “special function,” in another effort to boost the visibility of the countries’ bilateral ties.",2024-03-18T14:07:04Z,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press
North Korea's Kim Hints Daughter Ju Ae Is Potential Successor,"North Korean state media has referred to Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's daughter using an honorific typically reserved for the country's leadership, which analysts say could suggest she's being groomed as her father's heir apparent.
The child, presumed to be named Ju Ae, was dubbed a ""great person of guidance"" in the Korean Central News Agency report on a commemoration ceremony for a new greenhouse complex on Friday.
If she someday ascends to the top spot, it will be the third hereditary transition since the death of North Korea's first supreme leader, Kim Il Sung, in 1994. He was replaced by son Kim Jong Il, who was succeeded upon his death in 2011 by Kim Jong Un.
Kim Ju Ae accompanied her father on the greenhouse visit in Kandong, the suburban county that houses the Kims' summer retreat.
""The great persons of guidance, together with cadres of the Party, the government, and the military, went round the complex,"" the report said.
It was the first time the term ""hyangdo,"" Korean for ""guidance,"" was used in reference to the younger Kim, whose first public appearance was at a missile launch in November 2022.
She has since been seen at her father's side at a number of military events, raising her profile and leading South Korea's spy chief Cho Tae-yong to call her Kim Jong Un's ""most likely successor.""
""This level of personal worship for Kim Ju Ae strongly suggests that she will succeed Kim Jong Un as the next leader of North Korea,"" Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Center for Korean Peninsula Strategy at the Sejong Institute, told Agence France-Presse.
1 of 2
Other North Korea watchers have pointed out there are multiple potential reasons driving the reclusive country's messaging on Ju Ae.
""Kim has ostentatiously elevated the status of his daughter, having her accompany him to high-profile events in what looks like an apprenticeship role. The variety of her appearances has expanded, and the formality of protocol, language and attire for her has increased,"" Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Seoul's Ewha Womans University, told the Straits Times.
""Pyongyang's propaganda department could be planning decades ahead, but it's probably more focused on the current leader's brand image while putting up smokescreens to obfuscate power dynamics in North Korean politics,"" Easley added.
The younger Kim is believed to be about 11 years old. The name Ju Ae was first made public in 2013 when former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who considers Kim Jong Un a friend, said he had met her and Kim's wife Ri Sol Ju on a visit to North Korea.

"Russian arms deal is helping North Korean economy, Seoul says","South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said Monday that North Korea's economy is showing signs of improvement thanks to its arms deal with Russia. Photo by Thomas Maresca/UPI
SEOUL, March 18 (UPI) -- North Korea's sanctions-hit economy is showing signs of improvement thanks to an arms deal with Russia that is bringing back food and raw materials in exchange, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said Monday. ""The economic situation had been very poor, but since last year, the situation regarding food and fuel has improved significantly in return for the arms exports to Russia,"" Shin said during a briefing with international journalists in downtown Seoul.

North Korea has shipped around 7,000 containers of munitions to Russia since July for use in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Shin said, updating a figure of 6,700 he had given reporters in late February.
Shin said in February that the containers likely held millions of 152 mm and 122 mm artillery rounds. Seoul and Washington have also said that North Korea is providing ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia.
Russia has sent more than 9,000 containers back to North Korea in return, Shin said, carrying food as well as raw materials used for producing munitions.
The defense minister suggested that Russia may also be providing North Korea with fuel in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions on imports of oil and refined petroleum products, noting an uptick in military exercises in recent months.

""Looking at North Korea's public [military] training, the overall trend had been a significant reduction in the past, but in January and February this year, there has been an unusual increase,"" Shin said. ""The rapid reduction in North Korea's training in the past was not only due to limited resources in other areas but especially due to the poor fuel situation.""
In recent weeks, North Korean state media has reported on leader Kim Jong Un overseeing live-fire artillery drills and tank combat training sessions.
The defense minister's remarks came hours after North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea, its latest provocation as tensions remain at their highest level in years on the Korean Peninsula.
The United States and South Korea have ramped up their military cooperation in response to the North's growing threats. Last week, the allies completed a large-scale joint military exercise, which Pyongyang condemned as preparation for an invasion.
Moscow and Pyongyang, meanwhile, have grown closer since Kim Jong Un made a rare visit to Russia in September. Along with food aid, Russia is believed to be supplying North Korea with advanced technology for its space and weapons programs.

South Korea suspends the licenses of 2 senior doctors in first punitive steps over doctors' walkouts,"FILE - Doctors stage a rally against the government's medical policy in Seoul, South Korea, on March 3, 2024. South Korean authorities have suspended the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by medical interns and residents that disrupted hospital operations across the country. That's according to one of the doctors who spoke to The Associated Press.

SEOUL – South Korean authorities have suspended the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations, one of the doctors said Monday.
The suspensions are the government’s first punitive steps against physicians after doctors-in-training walked off the job last month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.

Officials say the recruitment plan is aimed at adding more doctors to prepare for South Korea's rapidly aging population in a country whose doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say that schools can't handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country's medical services.
In early March, the government began taking steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors after they refused its orders to return to work by the end of February. Police are separately investigating five senior members of the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, for allegedly inciting and abetting the strikes.
Park Myung-Ha, one of the five members, said he received a government-sent letter saying that his license will be suspended for three months from April 15. Park, who works for the KMA's emergency committee, said committee leader Kim Taek-woo was also given a three-month suspension.
The Health Ministry said it wouldn't confirm any reported administrative steps imposed on individual doctors.
“My fellow doctors and I are really angered and appalled by the government's measure,” Park told The Associated Press.
Park accused the government of attempting to break up the KMA emergency committee and sending a warning message to striking junior doctors. He said he and others are discussing legal steps to respond to the license suspensions.
About 12,000 junior doctors have been off the job for a month, but none has received a license suspension. Observers have said it would take a few months to suspend all their licenses and that the government would likely end up suspending only strike leaders.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Their strikes have caused hundreds of canceled or postponed surgeries and other treatments, but officials say the country's handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would burden South Korea's medical services severely.
In a briefing earlier Monday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo urged senior doctors to cancel their plans and persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.
“Under any circumstances, you must not use the lives of the people for negotiations,” Park said.
In early February, the government said it would increase the country’s medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say that more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show a majority of the South Korean public support the government's recruitment plan. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.",2024-03-18T11:45:49Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit
North Korea fires ballistic missiles as US secretary of state Antony Blinken visits Seoul,"North Korea has launched ballistic missiles as US secretary of state Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul.
Three short-range ballistic missiles were fired into the sea on Monday, as Mr Blinken visited for a conference on advancing democracy.
It is the first time in two months that North Korea has launched weapons of that type.
South Korea said that several short-range missiles flew about 186 miles (300km) and landed off the North's east coast after being fired from the capital Pyongyang between 7.44am and 8.22am local time (around 11pm Sunday UK time).
The South condemned the launch as a ""clear provocation"" and said it was sharing information with the US and Japan.
Mr Blinken was among senior officials from around the world who were in South Korea attending the Summit for Democracy conference, which begins today. He will also meet his South Korea counterpart, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also condemned the launch after his country's coastguard reported the missile launch.
Calling the launch a violation of UN resolutions, Mr Kishida added: ""North Korea's series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable.""
Recent weeks have seen North Korea's military conducting exercises with conventional weapons - often overseen by dictator Kim Jong Un.

5 Bold New Restaurants to Try in Brussels,"Brussels, long the realm of stuffy French restaurants packed with gray-flannel-suited diplomats, has suddenly gone bold and bright. Thanks to a crop of young chefs with iconoclastic ideas about flavor and sustainability, the city, in thrall to the rich sauces of Gaul for nearly two centuries, has emerged as one of the most exciting, and affordable, places to dine out in Europe right now.
These exciting talents are transforming the city’s old-fashioned bistros and cafes with spices from places like Korea, Latin America and Morocco, and “putting a vivid modern spin on homey local comfort food dishes,” explained Michel Verlinden, a Brussels food writer and restaurant critic for Le Vif, a major Belgian weekly. At the same time, they’re making the most of local produce like cabbage, carrots, endives and, bien sûr, brussels sprouts.
Brussels may be the capital of Europe, but it feels more like Brooklyn or Marseille gastronomically. Casual, creative and multicultural, it’s a city that’s equally at home with bulgogi and duck breast — even together in the same dish.",2024-03-18T09:03:53Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
Map Shows North Korea's Ballistic Missile Paths,"North Korea launched a salvo of suspected ballistic missiles off its east coast on Monday in a resumption of tests that coincided with the arrival in the South by the top U.S. diplomat.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected three short-range missiles launched from North Korea between 7:44 a.m and 8:22 a.m. local time, according to the Yonhap news agency. The projectiles all landed in the Sea of Japan, which is known in both Koreas as the East Sea.
""We strongly condemn North Korea's latest missile launch, which is a clear provocation that seriously threatens peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" Seoul's military said a statement.
Pyongyang's latest launches—its first known tests since firing a hypersonic warhead in mid-January—were also detected by Tokyo, which said the three missiles each traveled about 215 miles at an altitude of 30 miles before landing in the sea.
A Newsweek graphic based on data from Japan's Defense Ministry recreated the reported trajectories of the three launches on March 18.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the ballistic missile tests, which he said ""threaten the peace and security of our country, the region and the international community.""
Kishida called Kim Jong Un's latest show of force ""absolutely unacceptable,"" saying it violated U.N. Security Council resolutions banning North Korean missile tests.
In a brief statement, the Hawaii-based U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said it was ""consulting closely with our allies and partners,"" and that the event ""did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory.""
""The United States condemns these launches and calls on the DPRK to refrain from any further destabilizing acts,"" its statement said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's formal name.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are running high after a record number of missile tests by the North last year. The United States and allied forces from the South recently concluded their largest annual war games, which drew protests from Kim's regime for their pointed nature.
North Korea did not fire missiles during the U.S.-led Freedom Shield drills, but its state media released daily photographs of Kim personally leading field exercises including artillery firing, battle tank maneuvers and paratrooper training.
Experts say they expect Pyongyang to step up its military moves ahead of the U.S. elections in November in a bid to extract concessions from Washington. American officials believe Kim is likely to double-down on his strategic alignment with the Kremlin, which they say has already resulted in multiple weapons shipments to Russia for use in Ukraine.

Japan's NHK public television said Pyongyang's ballistic missile tests prompted a telephone call between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo as part of a new military hotline established last fall.
North Korea appeared to time the missile launches with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to the South. Blinken landed in Seoul on Sunday to kick off the third Summit for Democracy.
Blinken was scheduled to travel to Manila on Monday to ""underscore the United States' ironclad commitment to the U.S.-Philippine alliance,"" the State Department said in his public itinerary.

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Postcard from Korea: Padres’ Ha-Seong Kim shines in homecoming,"SEOUL — It was only an exhibition, a glorified scrimmage played on an elevated stage, but in some ways Monday marked the culmination of Ha-Seong Kim’s decade in professional baseball. Facing his first manager in the Korea Baseball Organization, playing in his former home stadium, the San Diego Padres shortstop hit two home runs and drove in four runs in a 5-4 win against the LG Twins.
“Can’t script it much better,” Padres manager Mike Shildt said.
“Some stuff,” second baseman Xander Bogaerts said, “is meant to line up.”
Over the past three seasons, Kim has emerged as perhaps San Diego’s most beloved player. Over the past few days in Seoul, Los Angeles Dodgers superstars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have drawn significantly more attention. A glance at the jersey-wearing fans that have flocked to Gocheok Sky Dome suggests that Kim’s close friend Jung Hoo Lee, even before his official debut for the San Francisco Giants, remains the most popular active major leaguer from South Korea.

Yet, as this country prepares to host its first MLB regular-season games, it is Kim who appears poised to serve as the emotional fulcrum of a historic series.
“You get to experience a lot of different personalities in this game … but now you’re putting yourself in his shoes here in his own country,” Padres third baseman Manny Machado said. “You can really appreciate the things he’s done and accomplished in the game. I mean, it’s not easy to do the things he’s done in the big leagues. But coming from here and doing it at the big-league level, not a lot of guys do it.”
🫰 AWESOME KIM 🫰 pic.twitter.com/V2kuV287ku — San Diego Padres (@Padres) March 18, 2024
Kim surprised some Korean baseball watchers when, in late 2020, he landed a four-year, $28 million contract from the Padres. Even as he struggled on offense in his first season stateside, he surprised everyone — including his new team — with the quality of his defense. He survived early tests against big-league pitching to surpass most expectations in 2023, the same year he became the first Asian-born infielder to win a Gold Glove Award. By now, much of the initial surprise has worn off.
What remains, according to those who have witnessed his ascent, is the energetic, understated man who quickly endeared himself inside the Padres’ clubhouse. Fernando Tatis Jr. last week commented on being impressed by South Korean culture: “People are swaggy here. They’re always dressing good.” Monday, Tatis described Kim as embodying the simultaneously organized and friendly vibes the outfielder picked up from walking through one of Seoul’s street markets.
“This guy is just a genuine person. He’s trying to be there for everybody, and he’s just a great guy all the way around,” Tatis said. “Kim is one of the best teammates that I have had, and I’m glad that I met him and we play baseball together.”

After starring in Monday’s exhibition, Kim described his two-homer performance as “lucky.” When a Korean reporter jokingly suggested he was lying, Kim pointed out he had enjoyed the advantage of facing the LG Twins’ pitchers in the past. He expressed his respect for Twins manager Kyoung-youb Youm, who managed Kim when the infielder was a KBO rookie.
“He’s the person that raised me to be who I am right now,” Kim said through interpreter David Lee.
In the Padres’ clubhouse afterward, multiple teammates expressed their happiness for Kim and the ovations he has received amid an already successful homecoming. Then the conversation turned to fashion; Kim has distinguished himself not only with his glove but also with his sense of style. Machado, who was recently spotted trying on “hanbok” — traditional Korean clothing — explained it was a gift from Kim.
Left fielder Jurickson Profar, meanwhile, was waiting for Kim to finish dressing after concluding his postgame media duties. The two friends were planning to go shopping in Seoul together. Profar said he agreed with Tatis’ assessment.
“I’ve been here, and I’ve been to Japan, too,” Profar said. “Japanese people and Koreans, they’re always swaggy.”

Shohei Ohtani to begin throwing progression when Dodgers return from South Korea,"SEOUL — Shohei Ohtani was always going to be a central figure this week, with his Los Angeles Dodgers debut set for Wednesday night against the San Diego Padres at Gocheok Skydome in Seoul, South Korea. Yet the more important development for the two-time MVP’s two-way future will come when the club returns this weekend to Los Angeles.
Ohtani, who will serve solely as a designated hitter in his first season after inking a record-setting 10-year, $700 million deal this winter, is set to start a throwing progression once the Dodgers return home, manager Dave Roberts confirmed Monday morning.
It’ll be Ohtani’s first time throwing a baseball since undergoing his second elbow ligament reconstruction surgery on Sept. 19. And while Roberts reaffirmed what he, Ohtani and Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, have said throughout the spring — that Ohtani won’t pitch at all for the Dodgers in 2024 — it opens the door for the next stage of his fresh tenure with his new club.

That includes, Roberts said, the possibility of a conversation about Ohtani playing a position at some point, rendering the first base mitt and outfielder’s glove sitting in his locker this spring more than just ornaments.
“We’ll see how that progression goes,” Roberts said. “If his arm is healthy enough, we’ll have that conversation in the field. I do know he’s not gonna pitch this year. But right now, our only focus is him being a designated hitter.”
While Ohtani won’t pitch in major league games this year, there remains a chance he goes deep into his pitching rehab by season’s end. Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who performed both of Ohtani’s elbow procedures (including a 2018 Tommy John surgery), told the Associated Press this week that the 29-year-old had an “enhanced version” of Tommy John this time around that also included an internal brace — a braided suture to help support his new ligament — and that Ohtani is scheduled to start facing hitters in the last week of September and that all should go well.
“I think with Shohei, anything is possible,” Roberts said. “I hadn’t heard that one, but if that’s what Dr. Neal said, then he’s the expert.”
Ohtani originally said last month that he was hoping to begin a throwing progression while the Dodgers were in Arizona for spring training, but both he and the Dodgers have been willing to be patient with the timeline.
“Time is on our side in this one, especially if he’s not going to toe it up all year,” Balelo told The Athletic last month. “Why rush that?”
Ohtani’s one-way play has done little to quiet the excitement of his Dodgers arrival, much less with the club just a short flight from his native Japan as they open the 2024 season, with the Korean fan base — an athletic rival to Japan — embracing the global superstar and roaring at even the mere sight of him.

“I appreciate all the attention, obviously,” Ohtani said through interpreter Ippei Mizuhara as the club arrived Saturday. “Attention’s always great, being a baseball player and being able to play with these great guys next to me, I’m just really excited. I’m excited to be part of the team and prove to everyone that I’m actually a Dodger now.”

South Korea's Yoon warns of tech threat to democracy at summit,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Monday called fake news and disinformation based on AI and digital technology threats to democracy, as his country hosted a gathering of senior global officials including from Britain, the EU and the United States. Speaking at the opening of the Summit for Democracy, Yoon said countries had a duty to share experiences and wisdom so that artificial intelligence and technology could be employed to promote democracy.
Technological disparity among countries is a major challenge, Yoon said, describing it as a root case of how some countries fall behind in economic prosperity and fail to make progress on democracy. ""Fake news and disinformation based on artificial intelligence and digital technology not only violates individual freedom and human rights but also threatens democratic systems,"" Yoon said.
South Korea is hosting the third Summit for Democracy conference, an initiative
of U.S. President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms. Digital threats to democracy, and how technology can promote democracy and universal human rights, are expected to be the main agenda of the three-day meetings.
""As authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the summit
. Like-minded governments and their people are working together to promote free and fair elections, Blinken said, noting that safeguarding democracy was a collective effort.
Neither Blinken nor Yoon mentioned any countries or leaders by name. European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova said 2024 is an election year around the globe and cited threats such as disinformation campaigns from the Kremlin among other actors.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations of spreading false or misleading information. Hours before the summit started, North Korea fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the sea for the first time in two months in its latest show of force.
The conference also kicked off just after Russian President Vladimir Putin was declared victor
in a record post-Soviet landslide in a presidential election on Sunday. The result means Putin, who rose to power in 1999, is set to start a new six-year term that will see him overtake Josef Stalin and become Russia's longest-serving leader in more than 200 years if he completes it.
A White House National Security Council spokesperson criticised the election and said they were ""obviously not free nor fair given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from running against him"". Putin told reporters he regarded Russia's election as democratic and said protests organised by supporters of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, against him had no effect on the election's outcome.
The summit is also being attended by British Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who said democracy faced threats on multiple fronts, including cyberattackers disrupting campaigns, populists embracing falsehoods, and ""autocrats holding sham elections."" Speaking at a separate session, Blinken said Washington was releasing the first guidance of its kind for tech companies to help prevent attacks on human rights defenders online.

North Korea fires multiple ballistic missiles into sea as US-South Korea military drills conclude,"Follow us on Image Source : AP A TV screen in Seoul showing North Korea's ballistic missile launch on March 18.
Pyongyang: North Korea on Monday morning fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles as part of its renewed weapons test, according to its neighbours Japan and South Korea, raising tensions after the conclusion of US-South Korean military drills viewed by Pyongyang as an invasion rehearsal. The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month.
Experts predicted earlier that North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy. Japan's Defence Ministry said North Korea fired three missiles, two together at 7:44 am (local time) and the other about 37 minutes later.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that the North Korean missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, all outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone, and that no damage or injuries have been reported. Kishida denounced North Korea's ballistic missile tests as acts ""that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society"" and accused Pyongyang of violating UN Security Council resolutions.
South Korea's military said it also detected ""several"" suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning. The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launches ""clear provocation"" that threatened peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain readiness to repel any provocation by North Korea, based on its solid military alliance with the United States.
War preparations by North Korea
Meanwhile, the US State Department condemned the launches, saying they pose a threat to the North's neighbours and undermine regional security. A State Department statement said the US commitment to the defence of South Korea and Japan remains ""ironclad"".
It is important to mention here that North Korea fired the ballistic missiles as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy. North Korea's military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state's leader, Kim Jong Un.
The US stations a total of 80,000 troops in South Korea and Japan, the backbone of its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. During the South Korea-US joint military drills that ended on Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a series of military training exercises involving tanks, artillery guns and paratroopers and called for greater warfighting capabilities.
The 11-day South Korean-US drills involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last year. Although the North did not perform any missile tests during the period, it condemned the military drills and has been pushing hard to mount nuclear warheads on its missiles targeting the US mainland.
Many experts say North Korea already has nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching all of South Korea and Japan, but it has yet to have functioning long-range missiles that can strike the US mainland. Before Monday's launches, North Korea last carried out missile tests in mid-February by firing cruise missiles into the sea.
Tensions in the Korean Peninsula
North Korea's barrage of missile tests since 2022 has increased tensions in the Korean Peninsula, with several tests involving nuclear-capable missiles designed to attack South Korea and the US. The forces of the two allied countries have responded by expanding their training exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan.
Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons.
While North Korean cruise missile activities aren't directly banned under UN sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan. They are designed to be harder to detect by radar, and North Korea claims they are nuclear-capable and their range is up to 2,000 km, a distance that would include US military bases in Japan.

"North Korea resume missile test days after South Korea, US end military drills","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Monday morning, its neighbors said, days after the end of the South Korean-U.S. military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.
The launches — North Korea’s first known missile testing activities in about a month — came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Seoul for a conference.

Kishida denounced North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests as acts “that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society.” He said Japan strongly protested against North Korea over its testing activities, saying they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban the North from engaging in any ballistic activities.
South Korea’s military said it also detected “several” suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning. The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launches “clear provocation” that threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain readiness to repel any provocation by North Korea, based on its solid military alliance with the United States.
According to Japanese and South Korean assessments, the North Korean missiles fired from its capital region traveled a distance of 300-350 kilometers (about 185-220 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (about 30 miles).Observers say the missiles’ fight distances indicate they are weapons targeting major facilities in South Korea, such as its military headquarters in the central region.
The U.S. State Department condemned the launches, saying they pose a threat to the North’s neighbors and undermine regional security. A State Department statement said the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan remain “ironclad.”

Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons.
Worries about North Korean military moves have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country’s long-standing goal of seeking peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and to cement South Korea as its “invariable principal enemy.” He said the new charter must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.
Observers say North Korea may launch limited provocations along its tense border with South Korea. But they say the prospects for a full-scale attack by North Korea are dim as it would know its military is outmatched by the U.S. and South Korean forces.

SEOUL, March 17 (UPI) -- North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea on Monday morning, South Korean defense officials said, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Seoul for a multilateral democracy summit. The South Korean military detected multiple missiles fired from the Pyongyang area between 7:44 a.m and 8:22 a.m., the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters. Advertisement
The missiles landed in the East Sea after flying for about 185 miles, the JCS said.
""Our military immediately detected, tracked and monitored the North Korean missile launch and closely shared information with the U.S. and Japan,"" the message said. ""Our military will maintain the ability and readiness to respond overwhelmingly to any provocation while keeping a close eye on North Korea's activities under a solid South Korea-U.S. joint defense posture.""
Japan also announced that it detected the launch, with defense officials saying that three missiles were fired, each traveling more than 200 miles at a maximum altitude of around 30 miles.
The missiles landed in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone, Tokyo's Defense Ministry said.

The launch came after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Seoul earlier in the day for the Summit for Democracy, an initiative started by U.S. President Joe Biden in 2021.
South Korea is hosting the three-day event, which kicks off on Monday and brings together government representatives, NGOs and civil society groups for discussions on fostering democracy and combating authoritarianism.
Blinken is also scheduled to meet with his South Korean counterpart, Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, later on Monday.
The United States and South Korea wrapped up an 11-day large-scale joint training exercise on Thursday, which Pyongyang condemned as preparation for an invasion.
The ballistic missile launch was the first by North Korea since Jan. 14, when it tested what it said was a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile.
Pyongyang has also fired several rounds of cruise missiles since the beginning of the year and has kept up a steady stream of threats and military exercises, including recent visits by leader Kim Jong Un to live-fire artillery drills and tank combat training.",2024-03-18T02:49:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

Animosities on the Korean Peninsula remain high in the wake of North Korea's barrage of missile tests since 2022. Many of the tests involved nuclear-capable missiles designed to attack South Korea and the mainland U.S. The U.S. and South Korean forces have responded by expanding their training exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan.
Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons.
Worries about North Korean military moves have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country's long-standing goal of seeking peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and to cement South Korea as its ""invariable principal enemy.""

North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Blinken visits Seoul,"North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday for the first time in two months, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy.
South Korea’s military said multiple short-range missiles were fired from a region south of the North’s capital, Pyongyang, landing east of the Korean peninsula. It did not provide further details and said it was sharing information on the launch with the United States and Japan.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launches after his country’s coast guard also reported the firing of what it said appeared to be a ballistic missile and specified that it had already ended its flight.

Japan later said that it had detected what appeared to be a second ballistic missile launch by the North, and that both fell outside its exclusive economic zone area.
“North Korea’s series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable,” Kishida said, calling the launch a violation of U.N. resolutions.
North Korea’s military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state’s leader, Kim Jong Un.
The show of force by Pyongyang comes just after the militaries of South Korea and the United States finished 10 days of large-scale annual joint military drills last Thursday.

On Sunday, the South Korean military also mobilised marines, attack helicopters and amphibious assault vehicles in drills aimed at surging troop numbers to reinforce western islands near the sea border with North Korea. The North shelled the islands in 2010.
Blinken is among senior officials from around the world attending the Summit for Democracy conference, which opens on Monday. He will also meet his South Korean counterpart, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul.
The summit is an initiative of US President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
In its last ballistic launch on Jan. 14, North Korea fired what it said was an intermediate range hypersonic missile using solid fuel on to test new booster engines and a manoeuvrable warhead.

"North Korea resumes missile tests, raising tensions with its rivals after their military drills' end","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Monday morning, its neighbors said, days after the end of the South Korean-U.S. military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.
The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month. Outside experts earlier predicted North Korea would continue its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that North Korea fired “a number of” ballistic missiles into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. He said the missiles fell outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone and no damage or injuries has been reported.
Japan's Defense Ministry said North Korea fired three missiles, two together at 7:44 a.m. and the other about 37 minutes later. They all traveled a distance of 350 kilometers (about 220 miles) at the maximum speed of 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) per hour.
Kishida denounced North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests as acts “that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society.” He said Japan strongly protested against North Korea over its testing activities, saying they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban the North from engaging in any ballistic activities.
South Korea’s military said it also detected “several” suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said the South Korean military bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States and Japan.
During the South Korea-U.S. military drills that ended Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a series of military training exercises involving tanks, artillery guns and paratroopers. The 11-day South Korean-U.S. drills involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last year.
The North didn’t perform any missile tests during its rivals’ training, however. Its missile tests are considered much bigger provocations as North Korea has been pushing hard to mount nuclear warheads on its missiles targeting the U.S. mainland and its allies. Many experts say North Korea already has nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching all of South Korea and Japan, but it has yet to have functioning long-range missiles that can strike the U.S. mainland.

"Hyundai, Kia, Genesis electric cars recalled for power loss, Australian impact unclear","Nearly 170,000 Hyundai Motor Group electric vehicles (EVs) are being recalled in South Korea due to a software error in their charging system.
South Korean news agency Yonhap reports 169,932 vehicles are being recalled across Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 lines, as well as the Genesis GV60, Electrified GV70 and Electrified G80, according to a Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport notice.
Additionally, 56,016 Kia EV6s are being recalled.

Should the Hyundai Motor Group expand this recall to other markets, as many as 500,000 vehicles could be affected.

The Ministry says the error could see vehicles fail to start and their batteries lose charge, resulting in a loss of power.
The companies will reportedly issue a software update once they receive the recalled models and, if necessary, replace the integrated charging control unit (ICCU).
Hyundai Australia recently launched a local service campaign affecting 3049 Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 models. It says this isn’t related to the South Korean-market recall announcement, and the company has yet to issue a recall.
It says the campaign was related to charging faults, and it rolled out an ICCU software update to affected vehicles while also offering to replace the ICCU if necessary.
However, the company says less than one per cent of all affected vehicles required an ICCU replacement.

“We are currently checking with our parent company to determine whether the issues encountered in the Korean market also affect Hyundai vehicles sold in Australia,” said a spokesperson for the Hyundai and Genesis brands in Australia.
“We will provide an update once we have more information to share.”
Kia Australia’s technical division has also submitted an enquiry with the brand’s head office regarding the issue.
We’ll update this article when we hear more from Hyundai and Kia.

The defect has also been investigated in the US by regulators, though a recall has yet to be issued there.
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation last year into Ioniq 5 and EV6 models, in response to customer complaints of a loud popping noise followed by either reduced or a complete loss of power.
The South Korean brands initiated voluntary service campaigns last year to inspect the ICCU and, if necessary, replace it.

"North Korea resumes missile tests, raising tensions with rivals","North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Monday morning, its neighbors said, days after the end of the South Korean-U.S. military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.
The launches — North Korea’s first known missile testing activities in about a month — came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Seoul for a conference. Outside experts earlier predicted North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.
Japan’s Defense Ministry said North Korea fired three missiles, two together at 7:44 a.m. and the other about 37 minutes later. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that the North Korean missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, all outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, and that no damage or injuries have been reported.
Kishida denounced North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests as acts “that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society.” He said Japan strongly protested against North Korea over its testing activities, saying they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban the North from engaging in any ballistic activities.

South Korea’s military said it also detected “several” suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning. The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launches “clear provocation” that threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain readiness to repel any provocation by North Korea, based on its solid military alliance with the United States.
According to Japanese and South Korean assessments, the North Korean missiles fired from its capital region traveled a distance of 300-350 kilometers (about 185-220 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (about 30 miles).Observers say the missiles’ fight distances indicate they are weapons targeting major facilities in South Korea, such as its military headquarters in the central region.
The U.S. State Department condemned the launches, saying they pose a threat to the North’s neighbors and undermine regional security. A State Department statement said the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan remain “ironclad.”
The U.S. stations a total of 80,000 troops in South Korea and Japan, the backbone of its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
During the South Korea-U.S. military drills that ended Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a series of military training exercises involving tanks, artillery guns and paratroopers and called for greater war fighting capabilities. The 11-day South Korean-U.S. drills involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last year.
The North didn’t perform any missile tests during its rivals’ training, however. Its missile tests are considered much bigger provocations as North Korea has been pushing hard to mount nuclear warheads on its missiles targeting the U.S. mainland and its allies. Many experts say North Korea already has nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching all of South Korea and Japan, but it has yet to have functioning long-range missiles that can strike the U.S. mainland.
Before Monday’s launches, North Korea last carried out missile tests in mid-February by firing cruise missiles into the sea.
Animosities on the Korean Peninsula remain high in the wake of North Korea’s barrage of missile tests since 2022. Many of the tests involved nuclear-capable missiles designed to attack South Korea and the mainland U.S. The U.S. and South Korean forces have responded by expanding their training exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan.
Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons.
Worries about North Korean military moves have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country’s long-standing goal of seeking peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and to cement South Korea as its “invariable principal enemy.” He said the new charter must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.
Observers say North Korea may launch limited provocations along its tense border with South Korea. But they say the prospects for a full-scale attack by North Korea are dim as it would know its military is outmatched by the U.S. and South Korean forces.

North Korea fires ballistic missile as South hosts democracy conference,"SEOUL — North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea on Monday for the first time in two months, at a time when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul to attend a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy.
South Korea’s military said the missile was fired to the east of the Korean peninsula.

Japan’s coast guard also reported the launch of what it said appeared to be a ballistic missile by North Korea and specified that it has already fallen.
Japan later said it detected what appeared to be a second ballistic missile launch by the North, also falling outside its exclusive economic zone area.
North Korea’s military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state’s leader Kim Jong Un.
The show of force by Pyongyang comes as the militaries of South Korea and the United States carried out large-scale annual joint military drills for 10 days ending last Thursday.
On Sunday, the South Korean military also mobilized marines, attack helicopters and amphibious assault vehicles in drills aimed at surging troop numbers to reinforce western islands near the sea border with North Korea, which had been bombed by the North in 2010.
Blinken is among senior officials from around the world attending the Summit for Democracy conference hosted by South Korea which opens on Monday. He will also meet his South Korean counterpart.
The summit is an initiative of US President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
At its last ballistic launch on Jan 14, North Korea fired what it said was an intermediate range hypersonic missile using solid fuel on to test new booster engines and a maneuverable warhead.
A month later, it launched multiple cruise missiles off its east coast including what it said was a new surface-to-sea missile in the latest of a series of such tests.",2024-03-18T01:09:13Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Blinken visits Seoul,"North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday for the first time in two months, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy. South Korea's military said multiple short-range missiles were fired from a region south of the North's capital, Pyongyang, landing east of the Korean peninsula. It did not provide further details and said it was sharing information on the launch with the United States and Japan.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launches after his country's coast guard also reported the firing of what it said appeared to be a ballistic missile and specified that it had already ended its flight. Japan later said that it had detected what appeared to be a second ballistic missile launch by the North, and that both fell outside its exclusive economic zone area.
""North Korea's series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable,"" Kishida said, calling the launch a violation of U.N. resolutions. North Korea's military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state's leader, Kim Jong Un.
The show of force by Pyongyang comes just after the militaries of South Korea and the United States finished 10 days of large-scale annual joint military drills last Thursday. On Sunday, the South Korean military also mobilised marines, attack helicopters and amphibious assault vehicles in drills aimed at surging troop numbers to reinforce western islands near the sea border with North Korea. The North shelled the islands in 2010.
Blinken is among senior officials from around the world attending the Summit for Democracy conference, which opens on Monday. He will also meet his South Korean counterpart, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul. The summit is an initiative of U.S. President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
In its last ballistic launch on Jan. 14, North Korea fired what it said was an intermediate range hypersonic missile using solid fuel on to test new booster engines and a manoeuvrable warhead. A month later, it launched multiple cruise missiles off its east coast, including what it said was a new anti-ship missile.

Japan melder om rakettoppskyting fra Nord-Korea,"Del
Nord-Korea har skutt opp det som trolig var ballistisk raketter, opplyser Japans kystvakt og Sør-Koreas generalstab.
Meldingen om oppskytingen kom like før midnatt natt til mandag, norsk tid. Ifølge den japanske kystvakten falt raketten ned i sjøen, utenfor Japans økonomiske sone.
Nesten en time senere meldte den japanske kringkasteren NHK at en ballistisk rakett nummer to også var blitt skutt opp fra Nord-Korea. Også denne raketten falt ned i havet utenfor Japans økonomiske sone.
Rakettesten var Nord-Koreas første etter at landet i midten av februar testet oppskyting av flere krysserraketter.
Torsdag avsluttet USA og Sør-Korea sin årlige felles militærøvelse – en elleve dager lang øvelse som Nord-Korea mener er trening på invasjon av Nord-Korea. Nord-Koreas leder Kim Jong-un gjennomførte samtidig sin egen militærøvelse, som omfattet blant annet stridsvogner, artillerivåpen og fallskjermsoldater.
Søndag ankom USAs utenriksminister Antony Blinken Sør-Korea som første av flere stopp på en Asia-reise der han også skal besøke Filippinene. I Sør-Korea skal han delta på en demokratikonferanse i regi av landets president Yoon Suk-yeol.
FN-resolusjoner forbyr Nord-Korea å skyte opp eller teste ballistiske raketter. Ballistiske raketter er som regel bakke-til-bakke-raketter som kan utstyres med atomstridshode.",2024-03-18T00:17:59Z,https://www.tv2.no,TV 2
"North Korea resumes missile tests, raising tensions with its rivals","North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles towards its eastern waters on Monday morning, its neighbours said.
It comes days after the end of the South Korean-US military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.

The launches — North Korea’s first known missile testing activities in about a month — came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Seoul for a conference.
Outside experts earlier predicted North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.

Japan’s Defence Ministry said North Korea fired three missiles, two together at 7.44am and the other about 37 minutes later.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that the North Korean missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, all outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, and that no damage or injuries have been reported.

Mr Kishida denounced North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests as acts “that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society”.
He said Japan strongly protested against North Korea over its testing activities, saying they violated UN Security Council resolutions that ban the North from engaging in any ballistic activities.
South Korea’s military said it also detected “several” suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launches “clear provocation” that threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula.

North Korea Fires Ballistic Missile as Blinken Visits Seoul,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least one suspected ballistic missile in a defiant show of force that coincided with a visit to Seoul by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is taking part in a Summit for Democracy being held in the capital.
North Korea fired the missile toward waters off the east of the peninsula, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The missile appears to have already fallen, Japan’s Coast Guard said, adding later a second one may have also been launched and appears to have landed. National broadcaster NHK said both missiles likely splashed down outside of the country’s exclusive economic zone.
Further details were not immediately available. North Korea has often engaged in provocations designed to coincide with high-profile political events involving the US, South Korea and Japan.
This would be the second ballistic missile Kim Jong Un’s regime has fired this year after shooting off an intermediate-range rocket in mid-January designed to hit US bases in Asia. The state’s official media said that projectile was a “hypersonic"" missile, indicating it deployed a reentry vehicle for carrying a nuclear warhead that can change its flight path at high speeds.
Kim and his official media have been lashing out frequently at the US and South Korea, with the North Korean leader saying the time for peaceful unification is over and striking the concept from the country’s constitution.
Prior to the launch, Kim had guided military drills that included fire from an artillery unit capable of hitting Seoul, overseeing training that simulated storming a South Korean border guard post and jumping in the country’s newest tank to take it for a spin. These stepped up threats against his neighbor to the south that coincided with it holding joint military training with the US.

The US and South Korea concluded their annual Freedom Shield exercises on March 14, which included training on land, sea and in the air against contingencies posed by North Korea. Pyongyang has bristled for decades against joint drills, calling them a prelude to an invasion.
Kim said in February he has the legal right to annihilate South Korea. Kim has also shown no inclination that he wants to return to stalled nuclear disarmament talks and meanwhile has rolled out a series of new weapons designed to deliver nuclear strikes on the US and its allies in Asia.
This has led to some speculation that Kim has turned the corner on his bellicose outbursts and is readying for battle. US President Joe Biden has warned Kim that it would mean the end of his regime if he tried to launch a nuclear attack.

उत्तर कोरिया ने एक बार फिर उकसावे वाली कार्रवाई की है। उत्तर कोरिया ने सोमवार की सुबह अपनी पूर्वी जलीय सीमा की तरफ कई कम दूरी वाली बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलों को फायर किया। उत्तर कोरिया की तरफ से ये मिसाइलें ऐसे समय दागी गई हैं, जब हाल ही में दक्षिण कोरिया और अमेरिका के बीच संयुक्त सैन्य अभ्यास खत्म हुआ है। उत्तर कोरिया की इस कार्रवाई से कोरियाई प्रायद्वीप में तनाव बढ़ गया है।जापान के प्रधानमंत्री फुमियो किशिदा ने संसदीय सत्र के दौरान बताया कि उत्तर कोरिया ने कोरियाई प्रायद्वीप और जापान की तरफ कई बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलें दागी, जो जापान के एक्सक्लूसिव इकॉनोमिक जोन के बाहर गिरीं। इन मिसाइलों से कोई नुकसान नहीं हुआ है। जापान ने इस पर कड़ी नाराजगी जाहिर करते हुए कहा कि यह जापान, क्षेत्रीय शांति और अंतरराष्ट्रीय समाज के लिए खतरा है। जापान ने कहा कि यह संयुक्त राष्ट्र सुरक्षा परिषद के उस प्रस्ताव का भी उल्लंघन है, जिसमें उत्तर कोरिया की बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलों से संबंधित गतिविधियों पर प्रतिबंध लगाया गया था।दक्षिण कोरिया की सेना ने भी बयान जारी कर कहा है कि उन्होंने कुछ संदिग्ध बैलिस्टिक मिसाइलों का पता लगाया है। दक्षिण कोरिया के संयुक्त चीफ ऑफ स्टाफ ने कहा है कि हम हालात पर नजर बनाए हुए हैं और सर्विलांस कर रहे हैं। दक्षिण कोरिया और अमेरिका की सेनाओं के बीच 11 दिनों तक चला संयुक्त युद्धाभ्यास बीते गुरुवार को ही खत्म हुआ है। इस युद्धाभ्यास के दौरान दोनों देशों की सेनाओं कमांड पोस्ट ट्रेनिंग और 48 तरह की फील्ड एक्सरसाइज की। माना जा रहा है कि उत्तर कोरिया ने इसी युद्धाभ्यास से चिढ़कर मिसाइलें दागीं हैं।कोरियाई प्रायद्वीप में साल 2022 से ही तनाव चल रहा है। दरअसल उत्तर कोरिया 2022 से ही लगातार मिसाइलों का परीक्षण कर रहा है। इन मिसाइल परीक्षणों में कई परमाणु हथियार ले जाने में सक्षम मिसाइलें भी शामिल हैं। उत्तर कोरिया के मिसाइल परीक्षण के जवाब में दक्षिण कोरिया ने संयुक्त सैन्य अभ्यास बढ़ा दिया है।",2024-03-17T18:30:00Z,https://www.amarujala.com,अमर उजाला

SEOUL, South Korea -- Shohei Ohtani may be South Korea's most-beloved Japanese athlete, a testament to his charm in softening any lingering animosity between the two neighbors.
Since his arrival in South Korea with his wife for the Major League Baseball opener on Wednesday against the San Diego Padres, the Dodgers superstar has been the focus of keen, special attention.
Many Korean fans are wearing Ohtani jerseys and rooting for him at the stadium. The Korean national team manager covets his autograph and myriad media reports and social media posts are praising him.
This is nothing new for the two-way baseball sensation, who in December signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers. But a Japanese receiving such a treatment in South Korea is extremely unusual, because of historical grievances stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
""Our social atmosphere has often made it difficult for us to openly say we like Japan,"" said Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Seoul's Hanyang University. ""I think Ohtani would perhaps be the first Japanese athlete who we can say we like. Maybe, some even consider him an honorary Korean citizen.""
Many of Ohtani's South Korean supporters say they like him because of what they call his good manners as well as his baseball excellence.
""Ohtani has been nice to Korean fans, so I think that's why everyone likes him,"" Park Sungjin, a 40-year-old physician wearing an Ohtani jersey, said before the Dodgers' exhibition game with South Korea's Kiwoom Heroes on Sunday.
The Dodgers and Shohei Ohtani posted photos on social media that showed the two-way Japanese superstar with his wife publicly for the first time.
""We have historical issues to be settled with Japan, but whether to like Ohtani is another matter,"" Hwang Seon-young, another Korean Othani fan, said at the Gocheok Sky Dome.
Ohtani, who is lauded in Japan as ""the perfect person,"" knows how to captivate Korean fans. Before his departure to South Korea, he posted an Instagram photo showing him making a ""finger heart"" gesture with a Korean national flag emoji.
After his arrival in South Korea, he told reporters that he's always respected South Korea's national teams and called South Korea ""one of my favorite countries.""
""The country that Ohtani likes the most is South Korea. The Japanese who South Koreans like the most is Ohtani,"" reads a Korean message posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved significantly since last year, with the South's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, taking a major step toward addressing disputes over Japan's colonial-era mobilization of forced Korean laborers - one of the long-running sticking points in improving bilateral ties.
In 2019, a forced-labor issue triggered widespread public campaigns in South Korea to boycott Japanese goods and services.
Ties between Korea and Japan have experienced on-again, off-again fluctuations. So if anti-Japan sentiments deepen in South Korea again like in 2019, Ohtani fans may feel a challenge in publicly expressing their likings of the 29-year-old.
But despite their often-rocky political relations, South Korea and Japan are closely linked to each other culturally and economically. Many younger South Koreans don't harbor the same strong resentment against Japan as their elders, and they often view Japanese athletes as just foreign athletes.
""They view Japanese players more comfortably. They just think there is Ohtani in Japan while we have Son Heung-min,"" Lee, the university professor, said of a prominent Korean footballer with Tottenham Hotspur.",2024-03-17T17:43:00Z,https://abc7.com,KABC-TV
Ohtani may be South Korea's most-beloved Japanese athlete. His charm is winning over historic rivals,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Shohei Ohtani may be South Korea’s most-beloved Japanese athlete, a testament to his charm in softening any lingering animosity between the two neighbors.
Since his arrival in South Korea with his wife for the Major League Baseball opener on Wednesday against the San Diego Padres, the Los Angeles Dodgers superstar has been the focus of keen, special attention.
Many Korean fans are wearing Ohtani jerseys and rooting for him at the stadium. The Korean national team manager covets his autograph and myriad media reports and social media posts are praising him.
This is nothing new for the two-way baseball sensation, who in December signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers. But a Japanese receiving such a treatment in South Korea is extremely unusual, because of historical grievances stemming from Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
“Our social atmosphere has often made it difficult for us to openly say we like Japan,” said Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Seoul’s Hanyang University. “I think Ohtani would perhaps be the first Japanese athlete who we can say we like. Maybe, some even consider him an honorary Korean citizen.”
Many of Ohtani’s South Korean supporters say they like him because of what they call his good manners as well as his baseball excellence.
“Ohtani has been nice to Korean fans, so I think that’s why everyone likes him,” Park Sungjin, a 40-year-old physician wearing an Ohtani jersey, said before the Dodgers’ exhibition game with South Korea’s Kiwoom Heroes on Sunday.
“We have historical issues to be settled with Japan, but whether to like Ohtani is another matter,” Hwang Seon-young, another Korean Othani fan, said at the Gocheok Sky Dome.

Manager blasts Jesse Lingard for 'not working hard' after Nottingham Forest struggles,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

Something went wrong, please try again later.
Former Nottingham Forest attacker Jesse Lingard is said to have received a dressing down from his new manager.
Lingard now plies his trade for FC Seoul in South Korea. He joined the club last month after being without a team since he was released by the Reds last summer.
He has made three substitute appearances for Seoul so far. However, his most recent one apparently saw his effort levels brought into question.

Lingard came off the bench just before the hour mark of Saturday’s 2-0 win at home to Jeju United. But it seems he didn’t make a particularly positive impression during his time on the pitch.
The Daily Mail report boss Kim Gi-dong said afterwards: “Even though he came on as a substitute, he didn’t work hard and avoided tussle. The name value has no meaning on the pitch. I will tell him this exactly.""
Prior to his move to Seoul, Lingard had not played a competitive match since April 2023, when he was a late substitute in Forest’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. He made a total of 20 appearances and scored two goals during his season-long stay at the City Ground.
The 31-year-old recently said of his switch to the K-League: ""I've always wanted a different challenge and to create new memories in my career. I believe South Korea is the perfect place for that.""

Glastonbury’s first K-pop group is a reflection of years of Korean government strategy,"The 13-member K-pop boy band SEVENTEEN will make history this year as they become the first Korean group on the Glastonbury music festival lineup. While top Korean groups such as Blackpink and BTS have performed in the UK before, this will be the first time the K-pop genre has featured at the world famous festival, which is held on Worthy Farm in Somerset.
The booking marks a major milestone in the decades-long ambition of Korean creative industries to find success in the global entertainment market.
K-pop has reached new international heights over the past decade. Girl group Blackpink broke new ground this year when they joined Spotify’s “Billions Club” with their 2020 single How You Like That (2020), marking over one billion streams. The most famous K-pop band, BTS, are also “Billions Club” members, thanks to their songs Dynamite (2020) and Butter (2022).
The global success of K-Pop is the result of a clever cultural marketing strategy deployed by the Korean government in collaboration with the creative industries. This strategy has dovetailed with advances in the ease of access to cultural content via streaming services and social media, resulting in a global fan base in the hundreds of millions.
The history of K-pop’s success
It all began with the Korean government’s recognition of the economic potential of creative content in the 1990s. South Korea was looking for ways to recover from the ravages of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Even as International Monetary Fund-imposed deregulation and liberalisation of the economy was rolled out in the 2000s, the government supported the film, television and music industries by maintaining a firm hand in the sector’s growth and export development. This included financial incentives for production companies and infrastructure development such as investment in high speed internet access across the country to support content production and consumption.
The strategy worked. The popularity of a steady stream of Korean television dramas began to grow in Japan and China. The Korean government then invested further in infrastructure to grow the industry and take Korean content beyond the region. Today, 60% of all Netflix subscribers have watched Korean content on the platform.
The success of Korean popular culture is felt across other areas of the economy too. K-pop and screen stars have struck brand deals with Korean companies, advertising items such as cosmetics, washing machines and smart phones to global audiences.
Korea’s cultural content market is now one of the largest in the world at around US$80 billion (£63 billion) in 2024, not far behind France and the UK. Its continuing growth is backed by a multi-pronged policy of financial investment, tax breaks and institutional support both in-country and via Korean culture centres in overseas cities. The government also provides financial incentives for cooperation between production companies and conglomerates such as LG and Samsung, which benefit from the success of Korean popular culture abroad.
The success of popular culture also lends itself to Korea’s public diplomacy. A concerted nation branding strategy implemented in the late 2000s and 2010s by the administration of Lee Myung-Bak administration aimed to push South Korea up the various nation branding indexes. Lee acknowledged the role that soft power could play in securing Korea’s position as a state with moderate global influence.
Since that time, K-Pop stars have come to play a role in Korea’s public diplomacy at forums including the UN and COP26.
No ordinary K-Pop band?
This is not to say that SEVENTEEN are mere cogs in a larger machine of Korean cultural content production and export. Unlike many other pop groups in their peer group, the members produce much of their own work, writing songs and raps and choreographing dance routines.
Unusually, SEVENTEEN is made up of a number of sub-groups. At times, these sub-groups record separately in order to showcase their respective skills across rap, dance and singing. As is typical of Korean cultural content, the band aims to create multiple moments of connection with audiences.
One example is the band’s reality TV series, Going SEVENTEEN, which is a mixture of games, challenges and behind the scenes clips, released weekly on YouTube and V Live, a Korean live streaming app for celebrity content.
As is also common in K-Pop bands, SEVENTEEN’s membership is made up of people from different countries including China and the US. This helps them connect with foreign fans and ensures there is always a member able to handle international media appearances in languages other than Korean.
UK-based fans will be thrilled their idols are making an appearance at Glastonbury, hopefully paving the way for more K-pop at international festivals in the future. It also perhaps shows that the festival industry is responding to the increasingly global music tastes of festival-goers, bringing new acts and genres onto their stages.

Police Raid Korea Aerospace Office: 2 Engineers Accused Of Leaking KF-21 Fighter Jet Tech,"Summary Engineers have been suspected of leaking technology related to the KF-21 fighter jet.
The aircraft is not a stealth fighter but boasts advanced technologies as a regional option.
The leaks were reportedly discovered last month.
Police in South Korea raided offices belonging to Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) on Thursday after engineers were suspected of leaking technology related to the KF-21 fighter jet, Reuters reports. The raid lasted several hours, with a company spokesperson saying that KAI was cooperating with the police investigation. The fighter jet is a joint development between South Korea and Indonesia and is planned to become a homegrown fifth-generation fighter aircraft for the region.
The KF-21 had its first flight in 2022 and was promising to be a cheaper alternative to the US-built F-35. The KF-21 is not a stealth fighter. However, it does feature a complement of advanced technologies.
Discovery of the leaks
Leaks about the fighter jet were discovered last month when Indonesia’s foreign ministry said that it was gathering evidence into allegations involving two engineers in the program. Both Indonesia and South Korea have been working since 2001. Back then, the program included partners like Turkey, which later abandoned the program for their own fifth-generation fighter development.

The KF-21 was almost abandoned in a few instances. However, in 2010, the fighter jet received a renowned push for development due to an increase in threats from neighboring North Korea. The engineers themselves were part of the Indonesian design team. At the same time as Indonesia’s foreign ministry statement, the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) announced a joint investigation with the Defense Counterintelligence Command of South Korea.
The investigation started originally when an engineer was caught attempting to smuggle USB devices from the aircraft development center. The leaked documents contained sensitive information developed by KAI subcontractors who were exporting their technology to help the fighter’s development.
International partners in development
Lockheed Martin, the designer of the F-35, provided KAI with some insight into its design and technology. A deal between the United States and Korea would give the KAI technologies such as the AESA radar and electronic targeting pods that the F-35 utilizes for its situational awareness in combat.
Poland, the Philippines, and Peru have all expressed interest in the KF-21. After building six prototypes and undergoing testing, the aircraft is currently in low-rate initial production for adoption by 2026. When the aircraft enters service with the Republic of Korea Air Force, it will replace F-5E and F-4E aircraft in the Air Force inventory. Those aircraft have been in service since the 1970s. The Korean Air Force additionally operates the F-16C, a domestic variant of the F-15, as well as the F-35 itself.
Common leaks
Leaks are not unique to KAI. Lockheed Martin itself was the source of several leaks, most notably in 2013, compromising plans for the F-35. Back then, the US Pentagon said the theft of data was a serious problem for US adversaries.
Documents related to the Eurofighter Typhoon, another aircraft that helped inspire the KF-21, were involved in leaks recently. This time, classified documents detailing aircraft performance and operation were posted on a video game forum website. The same website has been the subject of multiple leaks for fighter jet aircraft technologies in recent years.",2024-03-17T05:34:31Z,https://simpleflying.com,Simple Flying

Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante,"Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante
Von: Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-17T04:04:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de

SEOUL, South Korea -- Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani says the upcoming Major League Baseball season opener against the San Diego Padres in Seoul will provide ""great memories"" for him and his wife, but he'll attempt to focus on baseball.
Ohtani spoke to journalists with Dodgers teammates at a packed press conference on Saturday, a day after he arrived here with his wife Mamiko Tanaka.
Ohtani said it was the first time for his wife ""to come with me to a game like this.""
""So I think it's going to be really great memories for both of us. But like I said earlier, I have one job to focus on. It's baseball,"" Otani said via an interpreter.
In late February, Ohtani, 29, said on Instagram that he was married to ""a normal Japanese woman"" he had known for three to four years. But he hadn't said who she was until another Instagram post with a photo of him and Tanaka on Thursday.
Tanaka, 27, is a former professional basketball player who played for the Fujitsu Red Wave in the Women's Japan Basketball League from 2019-23.
The Dodgers-Padres games on March 20-21 will be Ohtani's debut with the Dodgers, and they will be the first MLB regular season games in Seoul.
In December, Ohtani signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers. He underwent surgery on his right elbow last September and will not pitch this season. He will be used as a designated hitter and there is a possibility he could play in the field.
Ohtani says he is aware of the intense international media focus on the games in Seoul.
""I appreciate all the attention. Obviously, attention is always great, being a baseball player and being able to play with these great guys next to me. I'm really excited,"" Ohtani said, referring to his two teammates speaking at the news conference, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman.
The Dodgers have landed in South Korea ahead of their games against the Padres. The team is preparing to kick off the regular season next week with the highly-anticipated Seoul Series.
""I'm really used to the attention, but I just try to focus on what's in front of me, whatever it is.""
South Korean media have churned out stories on Ohtani, mostly in a positive tone, with social media filled with messages supporting and praising the Japanese phenomenon. Members of his fan club in South Korea put up placards welcoming Ohtani's arrival at Incheon international airport on Friday.
That's not an usual South Korean treatment of any celebrity from Japan, given the two countries' strong rivalry in sports and other areas mainly due to Japan's past colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
""Japan and Korea, they've always had a great rivalry when it comes to sports. I've always watched the games between Japan and Korea and I always respected, looked up to Team Korea and Korean players,"" Ohtani said.
""So being accepted like this and welcomed is a very good feeling. And I want to put on a very good show for everybody"" he said.
ABC7 is covering the Dodgers in Korea! Next week, our own Rob Fukuzaki is traveling across the Pacific for the season-opening Seoul Series against the Padres. He'll report on Shohei Ohtani's debut and much more as the Dodgers begin a season with high expectations.

Kim Jong Un rides in limousine gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin,"Kim Jong Un has taken a ride in a luxury black limousine gifted to him by Vladimir Putin.
The high-end motorcar is likely a token of appreciation from the Russian president for the purported million or more shells that North Korea has sold to Moscow.
Although both countries deny Pyongyang is supplying shells and missiles used in Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Kim was sent the Aurus Senat limousine in February after being shown the vehicle during a visit to Russia last year.
Observers said the shipment violated a United Nations resolution aimed at pressuring North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program by banning the supply of luxury items to the secretive nation.
""The special function of the private car is perfect and can be thoroughly trusted,"" Mr Kim's sister and senior official Kim Yo Jong said after it was used for the first time.
""Kim Jong Un's using of the private car sent by the president of the Russian Federation as a gift is a clear proof of (North Korea)-Russia friendship, which is developing in a comprehensive way on a new high stage.""

"Paraglider crashes in South Korea, leaving instructor dead and tourist seriously injured","A thrill-seeking adventure took a fatal turn when a paraglider crashed into the ground in a scenic county in South Korea, killing the instructor and leaving the tourist seriously injured.
The accident on March 15 took place in Danyang, a popular paragliding spot with up to 20 vendors vying to offer tourists the experiential rides, local media reported.
The instructor in his 50s and the tourist in his 30s fell from a height of around 20m. They landed around 50m away from their intended landing point.
Both were taken to hospital. The instructor who suffered a cardiac arrest died while the tourist was being treated for serious injuries.
An employee of the paragliding experience centre reportedly told the police that strong winds caused one of the paraglider’s wings to fold, leading to the crash.
The police are investigating the circumstances that led to the accident.
Officials from the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s aviation and railway accident investigation committee also visited the site in Danyang, around three hours from Seoul by train.
Broadcast news video footage shows helmets, safety equipment and backpacks donned by the two men left in a heap on the ground. The video equipment used by the company to document the tourist’s experience was reportedly missing.
A police official said the paragliding vendor may face punitive action if it was found to be negligent in providing safety management.

Hyundai Mobis has incorporated various cutting-edge technologies into this integrated module, including an aerodynamic system that reduces air resistance and improves ECE. Notable features include a LiDAR that protrudes outward only during driving for design and sensor protection and an automatic charger retrieval feature that retrieves the charger after charging is completed.
This next-generation EV technology is being lauded as a pioneering example of enhancing performance, design, and convenience and constructing the vehicle’s front end as a total package.
A Triple Upgrade in Range Improvement, Design Marketability, and Charging Convenience
The most distinctive feature is a system that automatically opens and closes parts like the grille and hood, reducing air resistance during high-speed driving and improving ECE. This system, which allows the intake of external air and the exhaust of air after heat exchange, improves battery cooling efficiency, and controls the airflow. This combined aerodynamic system extends the electric vehicle’s range by approximately 20 km.
Electric vehicles typically adopt a streamlined design focused on reducing air resistance by eliminating the radiator grille, leading to a somewhat uniform appearance among passenger electric vehicles. Hyundai Mobis has differentiated itself by maintaining the traditional grille design while improving aerodynamic performance. Additionally, integrating design elements such as LED lighting has enhanced marketability. This technology is particularly beneficial for SUV and CUV electric vehicles, where lowering the vehicle height is challenging.
Technologies have also been applied to enhance design cohesion by preventing external contamination and impact on sensors. The LiDAR, hidden inside the grille when not in use, protrudes only during driving, achieving both LiDAR protection and an improvement in the front-end design marketability of the vehicle.
Another standout feature is the semi-automatic charging system. Simply plugging in the charger initiates the process, and after complete charging, the charger retrieval and the closing of the charging area’s cap/cover occur automatically. This feature reduces the inconvenience of users manually finishing during charging, presenting an alternative with better cost-effectiveness than charging robots.
Hyundai Mobis is reinventing itself as a ‘Mobility Solution Provider’ tailored to customers’ needs, focusing on future mobility core technologies represented by electrification, autonomous driving, and IVI. The company is intensifying its efforts to penetrate foreign markets and expand its order book, achieving USD 9.22 billion in orders from global automakers last year, accelerating its long-term growth strategy.

"Superstar Ohtani excited with S. Korea fanfare, opening game","Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani said on Saturday he was excited to receive international attention and play in his first opening series in South Korea for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Ohtani arrived in Seoul on Friday for the opener Wednesday and Thursday against the San Diego Padres, drawing fanfare from a large crowd at Incheon International Airport. He will also play Korea Baseball Organization teams and Team Korea in exhibition games starting Sunday. ""I'm excited to play in Korea not just for baseball but to experience the whole culture,"" the Japanese pitching and hitting phenomenon told a press conference in Seoul.
His second trip to South Korea as a baseball player also prompted widespread Japanese media coverage. A national hero in his home country, Ohtani was part of Japan's under-18 team when it won the world championship in Seoul in 2012. He said South Korea was ""one of my favourite countries"" even back then and he was glad to return.
""Japan and Korea, they've always had a great rivalry when it comes to sports. I've always watched the games between Japan and Korea, and I always respected and looked up to Team Korea and the Korean players,"" he said. ""So being accepted like this and welcomed is a very good feeling, and I want to put on a really good show for everybody.""
Ohtani, who made a surprise announcement of his marriage and shared a photo of his wife just before flying to Seoul, said it was her first time travelling with him for a game. ""So I think it's going to be really great memories for both of us,"" he said. ""But like I said earlier, I have one job to focus on - so it's baseball.""
Ohtani, 29, won his second Most Valuable Player award last year after leading the American League with 44 home runs and notching 10 wins as a pitcher. In December, he signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers after six years with the cross-town Angels.

"रूस की लग्जरी कार लिमोजिन में घूम रहे किम जोंग, पुतिन ने दिया है सबसे महंगा तोहफा, जानें","रूस-उत्तर कोरिया की है दोस्ती
टैंक चलाते दिखे थे किम जोंग
उत्तर कोरियाई नेता किम जोंग उन ने हाल में रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन की ओर से भेंट में दी लग्जरी कार लिमोजिन में सफर किया। किम की बहन ने शनिवार को यह जानकारी देते हुए कार की ‘विशेषताओं’ और दोनों देशों के बीच गहरे हो रहे द्विपक्षीय संबंधों की प्रशंसा की। पुतिन ने फरवरी में किम के लिए महंगी ऑरस सीनट लिमोजिन भेजी थी। उन्होंने सितंबर में रूस में एक शिखर सम्मेलन के लिए हुई मुलाकात के दौरान यह कार उत्तर कोरियाई नेता को दिखायी थी।पर्यवेक्षकों का कहना है कि इस कार को भेजने से संयुक्त राष्ट्र के प्रस्ताव का उल्लंघन हुआ है। संयुक्त राष्ट्र के इस प्रस्ताव का उद्देश्य उत्तर कोरिया को लग्जरी सामान की आपूर्ति पर प्रतिबंध लगाकर उस पर अपने परमाणु हथियारों के कार्यक्रम को छोड़ने के लिए दबाव बनाना है। सरकारी मीडिया में शनिवार को आए बयान में किम की बहन और वरिष्ठ अधिकारी किम यो जोंग ने कहा कि उनके भाई ने एक कार्यक्रम के दौरान पहली बार लिमोजिन में सफर किया।उन्होंने कहा, ‘किम जोंग उन का रूसी फेडरेशन के राष्ट्रपति की ओर से उपहार स्वरूप भेजी निजी कार का इस्तेमाल करना उत्तर कोरिया-रूस के बीच मित्रता का स्पष्ट प्रमाण है जो एक नए उच्च स्तर पर व्यापक रूप से विकसित हो रही है।’ रूस की सरकारी मीडिया के अनुसार, ऑरस रूस का पहला लग्जरी कार ब्रांड है और पुतिन के 2018 में पहली बार इसका इस्तेमाल करने के बाद से इसका शीर्ष अधिकारियों के वाहनों के काफिले में इस्तेमाल किया जाता रहा है।ऐसा माना जाता है कि किम (40) के पास विदेश में निर्मित महंगी कारों का संग्रह है जिन्हें तस्करी कर उनके देश में लाया गया है। इससे पहले किम को हाल ही में युद्ध टैंकों में बैठे देखा गया था। उत्तर कोरिया में बने हुए यह नए टैंक हैं, जिन्हें दुनिया का सबसे शक्तिशाली टैंक करार दिया गया। गुरुवार को देश की सरकारी मीडिया ने इस बात की जानकारी दी थी। उत्तर कोरिया के इन टैंकों को दक्षिण कोरिया और अमेरिका के युद्धाभ्यास के दौर पर देखा जा रहा है। गुरुवार को यह युद्धाभ्यास खत्म हो गया है। उत्तर कोरिया का मानना है कि युद्धाभ्यास हमले की तैयारी का हिस्सा है।",2024-03-16T05:41:47Z,https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com,नवभारत टाइम्स
The Deatles? The Sho-nas Brothers? Dodgers get a rock star arrival in Korea,"SEOUL, South Korea – Upon emerging from the 14-hour haze of their flight to Korea, the Los Angeles Dodgers stepped into a sea of flashbulbs at Incheon International Airport. The fans here camped out by the hundreds and did so for hours, rising to a stir for each of the baseball galácticos. They chanted Freddie Freeman’s name as if he were digging into the batter’s box at Dodger Stadium.
If the hordes of cameras and camped-out reporters in the parking lot this spring training were the appetizer, the Dodgers on Friday afternoon got their entree. The greeting was a slice of what they might expect during their season-long traveling tour.
A Korean fanbase roared for the franchise that debuted the first Korean-born big leaguer 30 years ago. And in a way, the franchise roared back, spending more than a billion dollars this winter on Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The flurry was a full-throated pitch to become the preeminent Major League franchise this side of the Pacific.

For weeks, manager Dave Roberts has likened the media crush awaiting the Dodgers in Korea to the arrival of the Beatles.
Now the “Deatles” — or the “Sho-nas Brothers” — have their first tour stop at the Gocheok Skydome in Seoul, whether they’re ready or not.
“I think we’re kinda starting to get used to it a little bit, but I don’t know if anybody can get used to this like this,” Freeman said at a press conference on Saturday, when he joined his fellow MVP teammates Ohtani and Mookie Betts at the podium. As Freeman spoke, each word felt cut off by the endless chorus of shutters clicking on cameras.
Seoul, we have arrived. pic.twitter.com/0LSmoRLkvv — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) March 15, 2024
The questions the Dodgers are facing here are hardly new. They’re just brighter, and louder, and there are more of them. For Freeman, the explanation is simple: the Dodgers had a heck of a winter, and that means more attention and more scrutiny.
“It’s been a lot,” Betts said, before repeating himself, “It’s been a lot.
“But, it’s cool. It’s kind of what comes when you get somebody like this,” he continued, pointing to the man to his right, Ohtani.
Much of the hype, of course, is tied to the club’s newest, biggest star.
When Ohtani’s interpreter Ippei Mizuhara emerged from the dugout during the club’s workout on Saturday, a mob followed, in hopes that Ohtani would be in tow. It turned out that he was. Ohtani quickly worked on his secondary leads before retreating back to the clubhouse.
Ohtani, of course, had made news of his own this weekend. In an Instagram post ahead of the club’s 14-hour flight, he completed a hard launch that led headlines in Japan: his new wife is Mamiko Tanaka, a former Japanese professional basketball player. When his new spouse came up during Saturday’s press conference, Ohtani’s cheeks turned blush red. Next to him, Betts and Freeman giggled with glee.

“I gotta hear this one,” Freeman said, reaching for the translating earpiece sitting in front of him. “C’mon Sho, don’t be shy.”
For as much as Ohtani claimed that he still isn’t used to the attention that has followed him since he was a teen, it’s safe to say he has had practice. As Roberts rolled through the club’s arduous flight, he perked up at a milestone for his new designated hitter. Roberts himself had only logged four hours of sleep. Center fielder James Outman had managed seven. “Shohei,” Roberts said, “slept 11 hours.”
So now Ohtani has plenty of rest and plenty of practice. The Dodgers’ newest frontman said “attention’s always great,” though his new teammates are seeing something different here.
“First time experiencing this,” free agent signing Teoscar Hernández said. “I think it’s gonna be fun. We have to try to enjoy it the best we can.”
It’s all they can do, really. The expectations have never been higher. The Sho is in town, and the club’s new reality will be cemented here against the San Diego Padres on Thursday, when Ohtani plays in his first regular season game.
“I’m just really excited,” Ohtani said through Mizuhara. “I’m excited to be part of the team and prove to everyone that I’m actually a Dodger now.”

Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante,"Tuchel-K.o. für Bayerns Korea-Kante

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-16T03:48:00Z,https://www.merkur.de,merkur.de
"Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani, wife Mamiko Tanaka arrive for Korea series","Shohei Ohtani has reached Korea with plenty of fanfare.
The Japanese-born MLB superstar landed in South Korea on Friday along with his new Dodgers teammates and his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, for Los Angeles’ season opener against the Padres, which is slated for next week.
Ohtani announced on Feb. 29 that he got married, but earlier this week, it was finally revealed that he was together with Tanaka.
“She is a Japanese woman, and I don’t really feel comfortable talking about when I got married, the exact date and stuff,” Ohtani, who is private about his personal life, said at the time through interpreter Ippei Mizuhara.
“But she’s a normal Japanese woman.”
Tanaka, a basketball player from Japan, is a 5-foot-11 power forward/center, according to Asia Basket’s website.

SEOUL – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used a Russian luxury limousine gifted by President Vladimir Putin, Kim’s sister said Saturday, praising the car’s “special function” and the two countries' deepening bilateral ties.
In February, Putin sent Kim a high-end Aurus Senat limousine, which he had shown to the North Korean leader when they met for a summit in Russia in September. Observers said the shipment violated a United Nations resolution aimed at pressuring the North to give up its nuclear weapons program by banning the supply of luxury items to North Korea.

In a statement carried by state media, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said that her brother used that limousine for the first time during an open event Friday.
“The special function of the private car is perfect and can be thoroughly trusted,” Kim Yo Jong said, without specifying. “Kim Jong Un’s using of the private car sent by the president of the Russian Federation as a gift is a clear proof of (North Korea)-Russia friendship, which is developing in a comprehensive way on a new high stage.""
According to Russian state media, Aurus was the first Russian luxury car brand, and it’s been used in motorcades of top officials since Putin first used an Aurus limousine during his inauguration ceremony in 2018.
Kim Jong Un, 40, possess a collection of foreign-made luxury cars believed to have been smuggled into his country. During his Russia visit, he traveled between meeting sites in a Maybach limousine that was brought with him on one of his special train carriages. Other limousines he's reportedly used include a Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman Guard and a Maybach S62.
Over the past year, North Korea and Russia have sharply boosted their military and other cooperation as they face separate confrontations with the West — North Korea for its advancing nuclear program and Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Drawing the biggest outside concerns was North Korea's purported shipments of conventional weapons to support Russia's war with Ukraine to receive high-tech Russian weapons technologies and other support.
Russia, together with China, have repeatedly blocked the United States and its partners' attempts to impose fresh U.N. sanctions on North Korea over its barrage of banned ballistic missile tests.
North Korea's state media separately reported Saturday that Kim Jong Un guided his troops conducting parachuting training the previous day. It's unclear if Friday's training was the same event in which Kim rode in the Russian limousine.
The parachuting training was the latest in a series of military drills that Kim has supervised in recent days, likely in response to the annual 11-day South Korean-U.S. military exercises that ended Thursday. Kim views his rivals’ exercises as an invasion rehearsal.
After watching Friday’s training, Kim ordered his military to conduct future training more intensively and make full preparation for a war, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. Kim made similar demands after he guided other recent drills involving tanks, long-range artillery guns and combat soldiers.",2024-03-16T02:12:17Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit
"North Korea's Kim rides car given by Putin, oversees drills","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly rode in a car given to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in ""clear proof"" of the strengthening friendship between the two countries, state media reported on Saturday. Pyongyang and Moscow have forged closer ties since Kim met Putin in Russia in September and vowed to deepen military relations. They deny Western accusations that North Korea is supplying Russia with artillery shells and missiles used in Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
Kim's ride on Friday in the Russian Aurus limousine is ""clear proof of the DPRK-Russia friendship, which is developing in a comprehensive way on a new high stage,"" the leader's sister Kim Yo Jong said, according to state media KCNA, using North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Kim Jong Un oversaw air warfare drills on Friday and urged ""realistic"" preparation for combat, KCNA said, after joint annual drills involving South Korea and the United States wrapped up this week.
""Only realistic training directly related to warfare can prepare soldiers as real combat fighters,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. The South Korea-U.S. joint drills were the first since Pyongyang in November scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military pact aimed at de-escalating tensions.
Kim also attended the opening ceremony of a greenhouse farm on Friday, KCNA said. Photos showed Kim's daughter Ju Ae attending the drills and the opening ceremony.

18-year-old soldier from West Virginia identified after he went missing during Korean War,"The remains of a 18-year-old soldier from West Virginia who fought in the Korean War have been found, more than seven decades after he went missing, a U.S. military agency announced on Friday.
U.S. Army Cpl. Ray K. Lilly, 18, of Matoaka, West Virginia, went missing while his unit was fighting on Nov. 2, 1950. His unit, L Company, 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division was fighting in Unsan, North Korea, when he disappeared. Several prisoners of war reported seeing Corporal Lilly at prisoner of war camp #5, but officials weren't able to determine his whereabouts.
U.S. Army Corporal Ray Lilly was accounted for 74 years after being reported missing while fighting in the Korean War. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA)
In 1953, North Korea handed over remains of service members to the United States. Among those returned was an unknown set of remains – designated as ""Unknown X-14682."" These remains were eventually buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.
In 2018, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), a military agency that aims to provide a full accounting for American missing personnel, announced a plan to disinter the remains of 652 unidentified service members from the Korean War. A year later the agency sent Unknown X-14682 to the lab for testing. Using dental records, anthropological analysis, mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence, investigators were able to determine in September of last year that the unknown remains were those of Corporal Lilly.
Lilly had died sometime in 1950 or 1951 while being held in a Korean prisoner of war camp, DPAA said. His family was notified and he will be buried in Princeton, West Virginia.
Remains of World War II airmen from Chicago and Michigan were also identified this week eight decades after being reported missing. Since the start of 2024, DPAA has identified the remains of 29 World War II veterans, 5 Korean War veterans and one Vietnam War veteran.",2024-03-15T21:30:42Z,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News
"Korea, Japan, China Increase Animation Collaborations","Animation co-productions between Japanese media companies and their Asian counterparts were once few and far between, but in the past decade, with the rapid rise of animation industries in China and South Korea, the pace has picked up.
Indeed, FilMart is playing host to an animation panel March 13 that explored the advantages of cross-border collaboration.
Still, given the huge worldwide demand for animated IP, fueled by Netflix, Crunchyroll and other streamers, it could be faster. Industry observers have cited various barriers to Asian animation co-productions, including political, structural, legal and cultural issues.
In China especially, where the appetite for Japanese and other foreign animation once seemed unlimited, connections with the Japanese anime industry have become strained, if not severed.
One reason is a 2020 law aimed at protecting minors that bans anyone under 16 from owning a streaming account and prohibits audio-visual content with “obscenity, pornography, violence, cults, superstitions, gambling, inducements to suicide, terrorism, separatism or extremism” to anyone under 18.
“Not all anime is sex and violence, but a good half of modern productions are aimed a late-teen demographic sweet spot that is now forbidden in China,” said Jonathan Clements, author of “Anime: A History,” whose recently published second edition contains new chapters on the consumption, production and distribution of animation in China.
As a result of this content clampdown, Chinese media companies that were once eager to invest in Japanese animation are now more cautious. “They are well aware that if they pay out for the wrong sort of anime, their investment is worthless in the Chinese market,” said Clements.
By comparison, Korean media companies are more open to anime productions with Japanese counterparts, using Korean comics, web novels and webtoons to supply much of the content.
Meanwhile, the Japanese production committee system has long been a bottleneck for Chinese and Korean media companies. Typically comprised of Japanese entities with a stake in the project as investors or rights holders, production committees can be slow to make decisions and resistant to foreign participation. “In my experience, [the production committee] is often a terrifyingly tedious chicane of obstacles, particularly with old shows where things that you could once agree with a handshake and a whisky now have to be run past a group of disparate strangers,” said Clements.
But they also offer access to Japanese funding, including government money only available to projects with a Japanese production partner. “The ability to buy into the ‘ownership’ of a new anime while it is being made can save a canny investor hundreds of thousands of dollars at the distribution end,” Clements noted.
In other words, a hurdle worth jumping over.",2024-03-15T21:00:00Z,https://variety.com,Variety

One reason is a 2020 law aimed at protecting minors that bans anyone under 16 from owning a streaming account and prohibits audio-visual content with “obscenity, pornography, violence, cults, superstitions, gambling, inducements to suicide, terrorism, separatism or extremism” to anyone under 18.
“Not all anime is sex and violence, but a good half of modern productions are aimed a late-teen demographic sweet spot that is now forbidden in China,” said Jonathan Clements, author of “Anime: A History,” whose recently published second edition contains new chapters on the consumption, production and distribution of animation in China.
As a result of this content clampdown, Chinese media companies that were once eager to invest in Japanese animation are now more cautious. “They are well aware that if they pay out for the wrong sort of anime, their investment is worthless in the Chinese market,” said Clements.
By comparison, Korean media companies are more open to anime productions with Japanese counterparts, using Korean comics, web novels and webtoons to supply much of the content.
Meanwhile, the Japanese production committee system has long been a bottleneck for Chinese and Korean media companies. Typically comprised of Japanese entities with a stake in the project as investors or rights holders, production committees can be slow to make decisions and resistant to foreign participation. “In my experience, [the production committee] is often a terrifyingly tedious chicane of obstacles, particularly with old shows where things that you could once agree with a handshake and a whisky now have to be run past a group of disparate strangers,” said Clements.
But they also offer access to Japanese funding, including government money only available to projects with a Japanese production partner. “The ability to buy into the ‘ownership’ of a new anime while it is being made can save a canny investor hundreds of thousands of dollars at the distribution end,” Clements noted.
In other words, a hurdle worth jumping over.",2024-03-15T21:00:00Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Science News Roundup: FAA to oversee SpaceX-led investigation into Starship mishap; South Korea scientists tout 'beef rice' as source of protein for the future and more,"Following is a summary of current science news briefs.
FAA to oversee SpaceX-led investigation into Starship mishap
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it will oversee a SpaceX-led investigation into a mishap involving both the booster and the Starship vehicle. SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight on its third try earlier on Thursday, making it much farther than before with a cruise through low orbit before being destroyed during a return to Earth.
SpaceX Starship disintegrates after completing most of third test flight
SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight through space on its third try on Thursday, getting farther than ever before, but disintegrated on its return to Earth. During a webcast of the flight, SpaceX commentators said mission control lost communication with Starship from two satellite systems simultaneously while the spacecraft was re-entering the planet's atmosphere at hypersonic speed.
South Korea scientists tout 'beef rice' as source of protein for the future
South Korean researchers have grown beef cells in rice grains in what they say is a major step towards achieving a sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly source of protein that could replace farmed cattle for meat. Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University in Seoul, who led the research published in the journal Matter this month, said the ""beef rice"" is the first product of its kind. It uses grain particles as the base for cultivating animal muscle and fat cells.
Antarctic scientists warn of bird flu spread as penguin cases confirmed
Scientists in Antarctica are warning of the spread of deadly H5N1 avian flu virus after the disease was first confirmed on the frozen continent's mainland last month and has since been detected in local penguin and cormorant populations. The spread of the virus, which has decimated bird populations worldwide and hit South American wild bird and marine mammal populations hard, has raised alarm about the potential impact on Antarctica's huge penguin colonies.
China launch of DRO-A/B satellite on Wednesday not successful - state media
China's launch of a DRO-A/B satellite from Xichang satellite launch centre on Wednesday was not successful, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. The satellite did not enter the designated orbit, Xinhua said.
Study documents headaches experienced by astronauts in space
Research in the expanding field of space medicine has identified many ways in which a microgravity environment and other factors can meddle with the human body during space missions. A new study has added to the field by showing that astronauts are more likely to experience headaches in space than previously known. The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S., European and Japanese space agencies who traveled aboard the International Space Station for up to 26 weeks. All but two of them reported experiencing headaches in space.
Chemicals in plastics far more numerous than previous estimates, report says
At least 3,000 more chemicals are in plastics — from food packaging to toys to medical devices — than previously estimated by environmental agencies, a report published on Thursday found, raising questions over pollution and consumer safety. While the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had previously identified around 13,000 plastic chemicals, the report by a team of European scientists found more than 16,000 chemicals in plastics — a quarter of which are thought to be hazardous to human health and the environment.

Nach seinem Wechsel zum FC Bayern war Minjae Kim in der Abwehr gesetzt. In den vergangenen beiden Spielen musste er überraschend auf der Bank Platz nehmen.
München - Bayerns Abwehr-Monster hat derzeit Sendepause. Minjae Kim (27) hat seinen Stammplatz unter Thomas Tuchel (50) vorerst verloren.
FC Bayern: Thomas Tuchel erklärt Verzicht auf Minjae Kim
„Für Minjae ist es extrem hart gerade, weil er eigentlich auch verdient hat zu spielen und herausragend gut ist. So ist es aber manchmal“, erklärte der Trainer am vergangenen Wochenende seine Entscheidung, lieber auf Matthijs de Ligt (24) und Winter-Neuzugang Eric Dier (30) zu setzen.
Im Sommer wechselte Kim für eine festgeschriebene Ablösesumme von rund 45 Millionen Euro vom italienischen Meister Neapel zum FC Bayern. Beim deutschen Rekordmeister war der zum besten Verteidiger der vergangenen Serie-A-Spielzeit gewählte Südkoreaner sofort gesetzt. Mitten in der jüngsten FCB-Krise setzte ihn Tuchel auf die Bank. Ohne Kim – und Dayot Upamecano (25) – in der Startelf gewannen die Bayern das Achtelfinal-Rückspiel in der Champions League gegen Lazio Rom mit 3:0 und in der Bundesliga beim 8:1-Schützenfest am Samstag gegen Mainz.

Bayern-Legende Augenthaler fehlte bei Upamecano und Kim die „Eingespieltheit“
„Als Upamecano und Kim zusammen in der Innenverteidigung gespielt haben, hat man schon ihre einzelnen Fähigkeiten gesehen. Aber man hat vermisst, was eine gute Abwehr ausmacht: die Eingespieltheit“, meint Bayerns Abwehr-Legende Klaus Augenthaler (66) im Gespräch mit der tz. „Gegen Lazio und Mainz war die Abwehrleistung wesentlich besser. Ob das nur an De Ligt und Dier liegt, weiß ich nicht. Die Mannschaft war davor schon ordentlich angezählt. Dann haben alle Gas gegeben und gesehen, was mit diesem Team möglich ist.“
Was Tuchel in der Abwehr offenbar lange vermisst hat: die Kommunikation und die Harmonie untereinander. Beides stimmt zwischen de Ligt und Dier derzeit. Vor allem der Ex-Tottenham-Verteidiger spiele „einfach ganz klar und er spricht viel. Und das tut uns gut, weil er hinten gut organisiert ist und einen engen Draht zu Matthijs de Ligt hat“, so Tuchel. Sowohl Kim als auch Upamecano gelten hingegen nicht als Lautsprecher.

Augenthaler stellt die Leader-Frage in Bayerns Abwehr
„Kommunikativ ist es nicht so leicht für Kim. Er kommt aus Südkorea, wechselte von China in die Türkei, dann von dort nach Italien und im vergangenen Sommer nach München. Er musste wieder eine neue Sprache lernen. Das darf man nicht unterschätzen“, sagt Augenthaler.
„Die große Frage, die sich mir stellt: Wer ist der Leader in der Abwehr? Ich dachte, Upamecano könnte der Chef werden. Er bringt alles mit: Er ist kopfballstark, schnell und zweikampfstark. Aber er wurde nach leichten Fehlern, die zu Chancen oder Gegentoren geführt haben, immer kritisiert. Ich bin aber der Meinung, dass es nicht nur an den einzelnen Abwehrspielern liegt.“

Bayern-Star Kim droht am Samstag gegen Darmstadt erneut die Bank
Der Fachmann und Weltmeister von 1990 sieht bei allen Innenverteidigern des FC Bayern Qualität. Augenthaler: „Die Abwehr war aus meiner Sicht aber bisher nicht zu 100 Prozent eingespielt. Man hat viel probiert, auch weil die Ergebnisse nicht gepasst haben.“
Mit Dier und de Ligt scheint Tuchel, der den FC Bayern spätestens im Sommer verlässt, nun sein Innenverteidiger-Paar des Vertrauens gefunden zu haben. Gut möglich, dass die beiden auch am Samstag (15.30 Uhr) in Darmstadt beginnen. Und für Kim der Bankplatz bleibt. (Philipp Kessler, Manuel Bonke)",2024-03-15T18:15:00Z,https://www.merkur.de,merkur.de
營商環境惡化 韓國大型企業紛紛撤離中國,"營商環境惡化 韓國大型企業紛紛撤離中國
【新唐人北京時間2024年03月17日訊】由於中國的市場競爭越來越激烈，北京當局的政策轉變，加上美中關係緊張，加劇了外企在中國營商環境的不確定性，隨著在中國經營的獲利不斷下降，韓國的大型企業正一個接一個離開中國。
韓國財經類網站Business korea 3月15日報導，韓國金融監管機構「金融監督院」的電子公示系統（DART）3月14日發布的訊息顯示，總部位於首爾的大型化學公司「樂天化學」（LOTTE Chemical）於2023年出售了該公司在中國的合資企業「樂天三江化學」的全部股份，以及「樂天化學嘉興」的全部股份，撤離了中國市場。
報導表示，中國曾經是韓國石化產品的最大進口國之一。但近年來，隨著中國經濟成長放緩，中國對石化產品的需求也在減少。在加上中國的石化企業大打價格戰，一直通過低價策略大規模擴張，韓國的石化企業在中國面臨的局面日趨艱難。
此外，韓國的電池產業也正在重組其在中國的業務營運。LG能源解決方案（LG Energy Solution）以及出售了該公司與中國貝肯科技於2020年成立的電池合資企業「江西VL電池」的股份；三星SDI則早在2022年就清算了該公司在中國的無錫和長春開辦的電池組公司。
報導說，韓國汽車產業也在大舉退出中國市場。首先是韓國汽車製造商退出了中國，然後是供應零件的韓國相關企業也撤離。
例如：世界500強企業、韓國最大的汽車製造商現代汽車株式會社，於2021年出售了該企業的北京第一工廠，於2023年出售了其重慶工廠，還計劃於今年出售其常州工廠。
隨著現代汽車在華業務規模不斷縮減，汽車鋼板供應商「現代鋼鐵」也開始重組其在華子公司和工廠；韓國知名的設備製造商萬都（HL Mando）公司則放棄了生產煞車和懸吊的重慶子公司；韓國物流公司現代格洛維斯也出售了該公司與常州集團於2023年成立的合資公司「常州格洛維斯」的全部股權。
值得注意的是，據韓國企劃財政部3月15日發布的公告，2023年韓國對中國直接投資（FDI）年減78.1%，創下30年來最大降幅，其中製造業在中國的投資萎縮特別突出。
事實上，不僅是韓國大型企業在離開中國，世界上許多跨國企業在過去一年都紛紛撤離了中國，導致2023年中國的外商直接投資（FDI）總額下降至330億美元，比2022年下降了82%，更創下30年來的最低水平。

"Egg thrown at Dave Roberts as Dodgers, Padres arrive in South Korea for MLB's first regular-season game","The 2024 MLB regular season begins next week on the other side of the world. The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will play two games in Seoul, South Korea, on March 20 and 21. They will be the MLB's first regular-season games ever played in South Korea.
The Dodgers and Padres both arrived in Seoul on Friday, and while at the airport, an egg was thrown in the direction of Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. It does not appear he was struck. Here's the video:
There were witnesses and police are looking for the person who threw the egg, according to Yonhap News.
The Dodgers and Padres were both greeted by fans and media at the airport, which is customary in South Korea. Korean athletes and celebrities are often interviewed moments after exiting the plane, so a large crowd is not unusual.
This weekend, the Dodgers and Padres will play exhibition games against teams in the Korea Baseball Organization. Next week, the two Seoul Series games will be the first time MLB opens a season internationally since the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners opened 2019 in Tokyo.
Roberts has been the Dodgers manager since the start of the 2016 season. He's amassed a 63% winning percentage and has led Los Angeles to the playoffs each year. Furthermore, he guided the Dodgers to the 2020 World Series title as well as 2017 and 2018 NL pennants.",2024-03-15T15:03:25Z,https://www.cbssports.com,CBS Sports
Photo Agencies Compare Royal Family to North Korea After Kate Editing Scandal,"The global news director of Agent France-Presse (AFP) has compared Kensington Palace to North Korea, stating it is no longer a “trusted source” of information after the revelations Kate Middleton Photoshopped her own picture.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4‘s The Media Show on Wednesday, Phil Chetwynd said that the royals are “absolutely not” a reliable source after the debacle.
“Like with anything, when you’re let down by a source the bar is raised,” Chetwynd told the radio show.
“We sent out notes to all our teams at the moment to be absolutely super more vigilant about the content coming across our desk. Even from what we would call trusted sources.”
Chetwynd noted how rare it is for agencies to kill photos adding that AFP was forced into the action after requests for the original photo were ignored.
“The previous kills have been from the North Korean news agency or the Iranian news agency, just to give you some background and context,” he adds.
The Associated Press (AP), which also withdrew the photo, today published a video entitled “How the Associated Press spots digital manipulation in photographs”.
AP photo editor Kiichiro Sato gives examples of previous photo withdrawals that came from pariah states North Korea and Cuba.
“We have to rely on handout photos from the government when we don’t have access,” says Sato.
The photo editor says that he blows up handout images to check for digital alterations and manipulations. In one example, AP pulled a photo of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un because a map on a table had been blurred.
In another case, a photo handed to AP of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro had been edited to remove Castro’s hearing aid, meaning the agency refused to circulate the altered picture.
Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day. C — The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) March 11, 2024
In a tweet signed by Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales said, “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.”
The admission from The Prince and Princess of Wales’ X account that the image was edited may have only come about because news agencies such as AFP issued the rare “kill” notice on the photo after it was apparent the photo had been manipulated.
However, the photo controversy has intensified speculation over Kate’s health and whereabouts. She hasn’t been seen in public since last year and the revelation that the official photo posted to mark Mother’s Day in the U.K. was doctored has seemingly sent the world into a frenzy.",2024-03-15T13:52:08Z,https://petapixel.com,PetaPixel

RIVERSIDE, CA — A young Southern California soldier who died in a POW camp during the Korean War will finally be laid to rest Friday at Riverside National Cemetery, and a funeral procession is planned across the region.
U.S. Army Cpl. Daniel De Anda, a native of Pico, was a member of G Company, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, 8th U.S. Army. He was just 22 years old when he was reported missing in action on Nov. 30, 1950, after his unit tried to withdraw from Kunu-ri, North Korea, following the Battle of Ch’ongch’on. De Anda died a prisoner of war in March 1951.
Remains from the POW camp where De Anda was held were returned to the U.S. by North Korea in 1954. They were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu. One set of remains designated ""Unknown X-14598"" was among the ""war unknowns."" The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred Unknown X-14598 from Punchbowl in August 2019 to conduct laboratory analysis.
Using chest radiograph comparison as well as dental, anthropological and mitochondrial DNA analysis, De Anda was accounted for by the DPMAA on Jan. 10, 2023. De Anda's remains were brought to Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. On Friday, they will be transported to Riverside National Cemetery for a formal interment with military funeral honors.
A procession route is planned. ""We reach out to the community ... to ask your support lining the [procession] route with flags for this hero's journey to his final resting place,"" Honoring Our Fallen CEO Laura Herzog said.
The procession will depart Rose Hills Memorial Park around noon, entering the Pomona (60) Freeway eastbound. The motorcade will travel roughly 50 miles on the 60, passing through the city of Industry, Diamond Bar, Pomona, Chino, Ontario, Eastvale, Jurupa Valley, Riverside and the western fringe of Moreno Valley before turning southbound onto Interstate 215 and exiting on Van Buren Boulevard, where it will turn westbound back into Riverside, entering the national cemetery via Harmon Street — the main entrance.

'Squid Game' star found guilty of sexual misconduct,"South Korea's ""Squid Game"" actor O Yeong-su has been found guilty of sexual misconduct, a local court said Friday, after he was charged with assaulting a woman in 2017.
The 79-year-old in 2022 became the first South Korean to win a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor in a series for his performance as a seemingly vulnerable old man in the mega-hit Netflix dystopian thriller.
The actor was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, the Seongnam Branch of the Suwon District Court told AFP.
He has been also ordered to complete 40 hours of classes on sexual violence, the court added.
The victim's own records of the assault and her claims are ""consistent ... and appear to be statements that cannot be made without actually experiencing them,"" judge Jeong Yeon-ju said, according to the court.
O was indicted in 2022 without detention on charges of sexually assaulting a woman, who has not been identified, on two occasions.
The incidents took place when O was staying in a rural area for a theatre performance in 2017, on a walking path and in front of the victim's residence, respectively, according to the Suwon District Court.
""Squid Game,"" a series that depicts a dark world where marginalized individuals are forced to compete in deadly versions of traditional children's games, quickly gained immense popularity on Netflix.
Within less than four weeks of its release in 2021, it attracted a staggering 111 million viewers.
The show's success has amplified South Korea's increasingly outsized influence on global popular culture, following global fame won by the likes of K-pop band BTS and the Oscar-winning film ""Parasite"".

Disgraced Yeong-su has received a suspended eight-month prison sentence and has been ordered to attend 40 hours of classes on sexual violence.
The majority of the hearings at the Seongnam Branch of the Suwon District Court were closed to the public.
But Judge Jeong Yeon-ju has since said that the victim's records of the assault were ""consistent...and appear to be statements that cannot be made without actually experiencing them"".
Yeong-su was charged in 2022 when an actress accused him of inappropriately touching her when the pair were on tour for a play, and again outside her house.
The actress has not been identified.
The actor has vehemently, and publicly, denied the allegations against him, insisting that he just held his alleged victim's hand.
At the time, Yeong-su said he had apologised to the woman, but added that it wasn't an admission of guilt.
""I just held her hand to guide the way around the lake,"" he told Korean news broadcaster JTBC.
""I apologized because [she] said she wouldn’t make a fuss about it but it doesn’t mean that I admit the charges.""
Just months before Yeong-su was charged, he became the first South Korean actor to win a Golden Globe and, in the same year, he was also nominated for an Emmy Award.
Squid Game fans seriously confused as Netflix drops first trailer for real life contest
Yeong-su was widely thought to be one of South Korea's most successful actors - until the charges against him.
South Korea's Ministry of Culture immediately pulled a government TV ad featuring Yeong-su off-air following the indictment.
He wasn't included in the cast for the second season of Squid Game, which remains Netflix's most-watched show of all time.
Anyone convicted of indecent assault in South Korea is subject to police monitoring - even after the completion of their prison term.
Since 2018, the MeToo movement in South Korea has been highlighting the prevalent climate of sexual harassment and abuse.
A wealth of allegations have emerged from the movement, bringing down some of the most powerful men in the country.
Executives in the K-Pop world have been accused of sexual exploitation and “pimping” girls out — while banning them from dating to keep their image squeaky-clean.
K-pop idol Baek Ji-young, 47, says she almost lost her career after her manager, Kim Shi-won, secretly recorded them having sex and then leaked the tape online when she attempted to change her contract.
She tried to sue him but he fled to Los Angeles, where he was jailed for having sex with a minor — which he also recorded.
Artists have also been embroiled in a string of sex scandals, including one known as the Burning Sun plot.
Police officials were arrested in the 2019 scandal in which women were drugged at nightclubs and offered to rich businessmen to rape.
Singer and TV host Jung Joon-young, 34, was jailed for five years for his part in the scandal, raping drunk unconscious women before posting footage to a chatroom.
Ex-Big Bang member Seungri was also involved and given 18 months for arranging prostitution for investors.

SEOUL, March 15 (UPI) -- U.S. and South Korean aircraft this week held a joint live-fire exercise focused on countering North Korean cruise missile and artillery threats, the South's Air Force said Friday. The five-day exercise began on Monday over the waters of the Yellow Sea and involved 40 aircraft including South Korean F-35A, F-15K, KF-16, F-16, FA-50 and F-4E jets. American A-10 and F-16 planes from the U.S. 7th Air Force, which is stationed in the country, also participated. Advertisement
""The training was conducted under a scenario of intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles launched by the enemy and precision striking the origin of the enemy's firepower provocation,"" the South Korean Air Force said in a press release.
The drills came in the wake of recent pointed threats from North Korea toward the South. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a long-range artillery firing exercise of units near the inter-Korean border that place the South Korean capital of Seoul within ""striking range.""
Kim also supervised the test of a new surface-to-sea cruise missile last month, as the North strengthens its defense posture near a contentious maritime border in the Yellow Sea.

On Thursday, state-run media reported that the North Korean leader drove a new battle tank during field exercises and called for preparations for ""actual combat.""
The allies' air drill coincided with their large-scale Freedom Shield joint exercise, which wrapped up on Thursday. The 11-day exercise focused on countering threats from the nuclear-armed North and included 48 joint field drills, almost twice as many as last year.
Pyongyang regularly condemns the joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills in the past as a pretext for its own missile tests.
The United States and South Korea have increased their military cooperation over the past two years in response to the North's provocations, with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets such as aircraft carriers, a B-52 nuclear bomber and a nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the Korean Peninsula.",2024-03-15T09:05:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
LCK Introduces Player Loan System Starting from 2024 Summer Split,"League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK), the organizer of the professional league for League of Legends esports in Korea, has announced the introduction of a player loan system starting from this year's summer split to enhance the league's competitiveness.
Riot Games, which conducts LoL esports in eight regions worldwide, has introduced loan systems in various regional leagues starting in 2024, and LCK has decided to align with the purpose and method of this introduction.
In implementing the loan system, LCK considered ways to positively impact both teams and players, aiming to elevate the overall competitiveness of the league while maintaining integrity.
Less experienced players will have the opportunity to secure playing time by being loaned to other teams, thus alleviating growth stagnation due to lack of experience and enhancing competitiveness. From a team perspective, loaning out players who have not been given playing opportunities allows for the assessment of their potential, and teams acquiring loaned players can expect short-term performance improvements by adding competitive players to their roster.
To loan a player, they must be registered on the team's roster. However, players cannot be loaned immediately after signing with a team; they must complete at least one split after the contract before becoming eligible. Additionally, a player who has been loaned out for two consecutive years must wait for one split before becoming eligible for loan again. Only direct player loans between two teams are allowed, and under no circumstances are third-party player loans permitted. Loaned players cannot be traded during the loan period.
Loans are only conducted within the same region. Players affiliated with the LCK roster cannot be loaned to foreign teams. Furthermore, loaned players are subject to restrictions on the number of matches they can play for the borrowing team based on their participation in the previous split. If a player participated in more than 50% of their team's total LCK matches in the previous split, they can only participate in LCK CL matches for the borrowing team. If a player participated in more than 50% of their team's total LCK CL matches in the previous split, they can only participate in LCK matches for the borrowing team. If a loaned player did not participate in any matches in the previous split, or if they participated in less than 50% of both their team's LCK and LCK CL matches, the borrowing team must choose whether to assign the player to either LCK or LCK CL for participation.
There is also a limit on the number of eligible players for loan. The combined total of players loaned out by a team and players loaned in by a team cannot exceed two. A team cannot loan out or loan in two players from the same team, and loans from the same team are limited to a maximum of one season. After the expiration of a one-season loan, a player cannot be loaned back to the same team. However, loans to different teams are allowed.
The loan period ranges from a minimum of one split to a maximum of one season. Loan applications and approvals are only possible during the off-season, after the team’s domestic and international tournaments are all over.
The loan system will be implemented starting from the 2024 summer split, and detailed information can be found in the rulebook.",2024-03-15T08:25:32Z,https://www.invenglobal.com,InvenGlobal

The Dodgers start the regular season against the San Diego Padres on March 20 when the division rivals face off in the first game of the Seoul Series. The series' second game will be played on March 21. Each game will be played at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul.
How to watch the Dodgers play in South Korea?
Games between the Dodgers and the Padres will be televised on ESPN and on SportsNet LA, the Dodgers' television home.
Here are the start times for Dodgers-Padres games:
Game 1: March 20 at 3:05 a.m. PDT
Game 2: March 21 at 3:05 a.m. PDT
The Dodgers will also play two exhibition games: against the Kiwoom Heroes of the Korea Baseball Organization on March 16 at 8 p.m. PDT, and against Team Korea on March 18 at 3 a.m. PDT. Both games will be televised on SportsNet LA.
Will Shohei Ohtani play in the Seoul Series?
Shoehi Ohtani is expected to make his Dodgers' regular-season debut in the Seoul Series after signing a 10-year, $700 million contract in December. He will be in the lineup as the team's designated hitter. The reigning AL MVP underwent right elbow surgery last September and will not pitch this season.
Ohtani and the Dodgers posted the first public photos of the two-way star and his wife, Japanese basketball star Mamiko Tanaka, as the team headed out to Seoul on March 14.
The Dodgers have landed in South Korea ahead of their games against the Padres. The team is preparing to kick off the regular season next week with the highly-anticipated Seoul Series.
Who will be pitching during the games in South Korea?
The Dodgers will have Santa Clarita native Tyler Glasnow pitch the first game against the Padres and Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start the second game.
Los Angeles traded for Glasnow during the offseason and the two sides agreed to a five-year, $136.5 million extension. Days later, the Dodgers added Yamamoto on a 12-year, $325 million deal.
For the Padres, Yu Darvish will start game 1 and Joe Musgrove will start game 2.
Who is part of the Dodgers' starting lineup?
The Dodgers will have Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman - three former MVPs - at the top of their batting order. Betts, Ohtani and Freeman were among the best hitters last year and will be an intimidating trio for opposing pitchers.
Dodger fans will see other familiar faces in the starting lineup, most likely catcher Will Smith, third baseman Max Muncy and outfielder James Outman. The addition of outfielder Teoscar Hernández is expected to bring even more power to Los Angeles' lineup.
A big question going into the season will be whether Gavin Lux can hold down second base. Manager Dave Roberts switched Betts and Lux in the infield after Lux's defensive struggles at shortstop. Lux, who tore his right ACL last year, will now slide to second base and Betts will start at shortstop.
Jason Heyward, Chris Taylor and Kiké Hernández will have platoon roles heading into the season.
When is the Dodgers season home opener?
The first regular season game at Dodger Stadium will be on March 28 when the Dodgers face the St. Louis Cardinals.
Between the Seoul Series and the home opener, the Dodgers will play three spring training games against the Angels.
Have the Dodgers played internationally before?
The last time the Dodgers played on an international field was in 2018 against the Padres in Monterrey, Mexico. The team also played in Sydney, Austrailia in the 2014 season opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Before that, the Dodgers played in several exhibition games overseas, according to MLB.
Has MLB had international season openers before?
The Seoul Series will be the ninth time MLB has held a season opener outside of the U.S. and Canada. The first international season opener was in 1999 in Monterrey, Mexico between the Colorado Rockies and Padres. The most recent was in 2019 in Tokyo, Japan with the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners.",2024-03-15T05:03:00Z,https://abc7.com,KABC-TV
Science News Roundup: FAA to oversee SpaceX-led investigation into Starship mishap; South Korea scientists tout 'beef rice' as source of protein for the future and more,"Following is a summary of current science news briefs.
FAA to oversee SpaceX-led investigation into Starship mishap
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it will oversee a SpaceX-led investigation into a mishap involving both the booster and the Starship vehicle. SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight on its third try earlier on Thursday, making it much farther than before with a cruise through low orbit before being destroyed during a return to Earth.
SpaceX Starship disintegrates after completing most of third test flight
SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight through space on its third try on Thursday, getting farther than ever before, but disintegrated on its return to Earth. During a webcast of the flight, SpaceX commentators said mission control lost communication with Starship from two satellite systems simultaneously while the spacecraft was re-entering the planet's atmosphere at hypersonic speed.
South Korea scientists tout 'beef rice' as source of protein for the future
South Korean researchers have grown beef cells in rice grains in what they say is a major step towards achieving a sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly source of protein that could replace farmed cattle for meat. Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University in Seoul, who led the research published in the journal Matter this month, said the ""beef rice"" is the first product of its kind. It uses grain particles as the base for cultivating animal muscle and fat cells.
Antarctic scientists warn of bird flu spread as penguin cases confirmed
Scientists in Antarctica are warning of the spread of deadly H5N1 avian flu virus after the disease was first confirmed on the frozen continent's mainland last month and has since been detected in local penguin and cormorant populations. The spread of the virus, which has decimated bird populations worldwide and hit South American wild bird and marine mammal populations hard, has raised alarm about the potential impact on Antarctica's huge penguin colonies.
China launch of DRO-A/B satellite on Wednesday not successful - state media
China's launch of a DRO-A/B satellite from Xichang satellite launch centre on Wednesday was not successful, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. The satellite did not enter the designated orbit, Xinhua said.
Study documents headaches experienced by astronauts in space
Research in the expanding field of space medicine has identified many ways in which a microgravity environment and other factors can meddle with the human body during space missions. A new study has added to the field by showing that astronauts are more likely to experience headaches in space than previously known. The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S., European, and Japanese space agencies who traveled aboard the International Space Station for up to 26 weeks. All but two of them reported experiencing headaches in space.
Why did menopause evolve? New study of whales gives some clues
Menopause is a rare trait among Earth's species, known to exist in only a few. Humans are one. Killer whales and four other toothed whales are the others. New research examines menopause in these whales, with findings that may help explain why this phenomenon evolved, given that it is known in just six of the 6,000-plus mammal species living today. It might be titled: the tale of the Helpful Grandma Whale.
Chemicals in plastics far more numerous than previous estimates, report says
At least 3,000 more chemicals are in plastics — from food packaging to toys to medical devices — than previously estimated by environmental agencies, a report published on Thursday found, raising questions over pollution and consumer safety. While the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had previously identified around 13,000 plastic chemicals, the report by a team of European scientists found more than 16,000 chemicals in plastics — a quarter of which are thought to be hazardous to human health and the environment.
Japanese firm Space One's Kairos rocket explodes on inaugural flight
Kairos, a small, solid-fuel rocket made by Japan's Space One, exploded just seconds into its inaugural launch on Wednesday as the firm tried to become the first Japanese company to put a satellite in orbit. The setback for Space One and the rocket industry in Japan comes as the government and investors ramp up support for the sector amid a national security buildup and skyrocketing demand for commercial satellites.

South Korea plans to speed up reforms to boost shareholder returns,"South Korea's financial regulator will look at speeding up the corporate reforms proposed last month and could reportedly add newer measures, after market players voiced concerns the announced steps might not be enough to tackle the so-called ""Korea discount.""
The Financial Services Commission held a meeting on Thursday with domestic institutional investors and the country's pension fund, where vice chairman Kim So-young said the schedule for the reforms announced earlier would be speeded up, according to a Reuters report.
""We will do our best to announce and implement before the previously planned schedule, as the market's expectations are high.""
In a statement issued after the meeting, the FSC said it aims to establish transparent markets, make capital market more accessible and push for shareholder returns to boost South Korea's undervalued stock markets.
The regulator said it would also encourage institutional investors to ""actively communicate with companies about the need to take voluntary measures to enhance valuations.""",2024-03-15T04:00:12Z,https://www.cnbc.com,CNBC

North Korean-linked cyber hackers have laundered $13 million worth of ether this week through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, data from blockchain analytics company Elliptic shows.
North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group funneled stolen crypto in 40 transcations into the virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash on March 13 and 14, according to research from Elliptic.
The laundered funds were part of the $100 million of cryptocurrency stolen from exchange HTX and its HECO cross-chain bridge in November 2023.
""Following common crypto-laundering patterns, the stolen tokens were immediately swapped for ETH, using decentralized exchanges. The stolen funds then lay dormant until yesterday, March 13, when the stolen crypto assets began to be sent through Tornado Cash,"" analysts said in a note.

Tornado Cash and similar mixers obscure funds by blending tokens from diverse sources before transferring them. The service was blacklisted by the US Department of the Treasury in August 2022. The department said the mixer had been used to launder more than $7 billion since it was created in 2019.
Shortly after the sanctions hit, Lazarus Group turned to Sinbad mixer to obscure its funds, but US authorities seized Sinbad in November, forcing Lazarus back to Tornado Cash.
Now, Tornado Cash keeps is up and running despite sanctions, as it operates on decentralized blockchains and smart contracts, putting it out of reach of authorities.
Lazarus Group has orchestrated hacks totaling over $3 billion in the last six years, per cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.

"Meet Mamiko Tanaka, former Japanese pro basketball player and Shohei Ohtani’s wife","On the eve of his first road trip as a Los Angeles Dodger, Shohei Ohtani answered one mystery about himself: the identity of his wife, Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka.
Ohtani posted on Instagram on Thursday a picture of himself with Tanaka, alongside new Dodgers teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto and translator Ippei Mazuhara. The group was about to board a flight to Seoul, South Korea, where the Dodgers will open the regular season with a two-game series against the San Diego Padres.
“Can’t wait!” Ohtani wrote.
Ohtani has used his social media feed for several major announcements in recent months. He revealed his decision to join the Dodgers in December on Instagram. On Feb. 28, he announced his marriage. He described his wife as a “normal Japanese woman,” which was interpreted to mean that his spouse was not a celebrity. The two became engaged last year. Tanaka joined him at spring training this year in Arizona.
Tanaka, 27, played for the Fujitsu Red Wave of the Women’s Japan Basketball League from 2019 to 2023. Ohtani has said the relationship did not influence his decision to remain in Southern California after six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels.
“She has a great understanding of my profession,” Ohtani said. “She’s willing to be wherever I want to play at. Ultimately, it was up to me. So it had nothing to do with it.”

Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine picks ex-admiral as chief priest,"Japan's Yasukuni Shrine has picked a former military commander as its chief priest in a move that could stir controversy over a site that other Asian nations see as a symbol of Japan's wartime aggression. Umio Otsuka, 63, a former Maritime Self Defense Force (SDF) commander and a one-time ambassador to Djibouti, confirmed his appointment, which marks the first time since 1978 for an ex-military official to assume the post.
The last retired military officer appointed as chief priest, Nagayoshi Matsudaira, enshrined 14 prominent convicted war criminals alongside the 2.5 million war dead honoured at the shrine, including World War Two-era prime minister Hideki Tojo. ""I feel very honoured that the next stage of my life will be to serve this shrine for peace, where the spirits of those who gave their precious lives for the country are commemorated and honoured,"" Otsuka told Reuters.
A spokesperson for Yasukuni Shrine, whose name means ""peaceful country"" in Japanese, declined to confirm his appointment. Visits to the shrine by senior Japanese political figures have drawn criticism from countries such as South Korea, which was under Tokyo's colonial rule for 35 years, and China, which Japan invaded.
Conservatives assert that Yasukuni, which was established in 1869 as Japan emerged from more than 250 years of isolation, is meant to commemorate all the nation's war dead and is not a shrine dedicated to those blamed for waging war on Japan's neighbours. Otsuka's appointment comes as Tokyo and Seoul deepen security cooperation with each other and their shared ally, the United States, in response to escalating regional threats from China, Russia and North Korea.
No serving Japanese prime minister has visited the shrine since Shinzo Abe went in 2013, prompting an expression of disappointment by then-U.S. President Barrack Obama.

South Korea sends scandal-hit ambassador to Australia,"However, analysts and government sources in Seoul said Mr Lee’s appointment should be viewed in the context of South Korea’s deepening defence relations with Australia. It is rare for Seoul to appoint a former minister to any diplomatic posting, let alone Canberra.
There are hopes President Yoon will visit Australia this year, although dates are unlikely to be discussed until after the April 10 parliamentary elections.
Anthony Albanese has not yet visited South Korea as prime minster, although Defence Minister Richard Marles went there last year, and Resources Minister Madeleine King travelled there in January.
The choice of envoy, said to be a personal pick by Mr Yoon, is the latest move by his government to prioritise relations with neighbour Japan and Australia as a hedge against a potentially, less-friendly US – its key ally – if Donald Trump were to win the November 5 presidential election.
Tensions are also rising on the Korean peninsula, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un warning he is preparing for war, although Canberra does not believe an attack is imminent.
Australia is increasing its contributions to security on the Korean peninsula by taking part in multilateral defence exercises and contingency planning, said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.

“At the same time, Canberra provides some diplomatic cover for Seoul while relations with Beijing remain sensitive,” Mr Easley said.
“Australia’s foreign policy shows that standing up for stability in the Taiwan Strait and maritime security in Asia, and standing against economic coercion in the region, are not unilateral-led attempts to gang up on China, but rather common efforts for maintaining a rules-based order.”
Another key focus of the relationship is South Korea’s booming defence industry, of which Australia is a major customer.
In December, Korean company Hanwha won a $US2.4 billon ($3.65 billion) deal to build 129 infantry fighting vehicles for the Australian Army. The company is building a manufacturing facility in Geelong, and South Korean companies are also bidding for contracts to build naval frigates for Australia.
While President Yoon’s policies towards Australia are unlikely to be affected by April’s election, as he will retain power until 2027, his ruling conservative party is battling to hold on to enough parliamentary seats to maintain a majority and pass legislation.
While South Korea and Australia do not have a Reciprocal Access Agreement similar to the one signed with Japan last year, both countries are looking at ramping up co-operation including joint exercises and training, access to each other’s facilities, and defence science.",2024-03-15T01:50:41Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review

While there's a lot of excitement about Ohtani's debut after he signed a record 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers this offseason, he won't be on the mound. Ohtani will not pitch in 2024 -- his role will primarily be as a designated hitter, though there's a chance he could play the field this season -- as he recovers from elbow surgery he underwent last September.
Los Angeles also added Tyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto this winter, and both are expected to start during the Seoul Series. Glasnow will start Wednesday's game against Yu Darvish of the Padres. Yamamoto will face Joe Musgrove in Thursday's contest. The Dodgers acquired Glasnow in a trade with the Tampa Bay Rays and signed Japanese star Yamamoto to a 12-year, $325 million deal in December. The Dodgers spent more than $1 billion to add Ohtani, Glasnow and Yamamoto this offseason.

Baseball-MLB star Ohtani shares photo of wife as Dodgers head to South Korea,"Shohei Ohtani and his Los Angeles Dodgers side shared photographs of the Major League Baseball star's wife on social media for the first time on Friday, as the team boarded a plane to head to South Korea for the MLB season opener next week.
There has been widespread speculation over the marital status of Ohtani, the dual-threat MLB star and a national hero in Japan. The identify of his wife was a hot topic across Japanese print and social media on Friday after pictures emerged showing the couple together. Japanese media named the woman as Mamiko Tanaka, who played in Japan's Women's Basketball League.
Ohtani posted a photograph on Instagram posing with Tanaka in front of a plane with the message ""Can't wait!"" in Korean followed by the national flag of South Korea. Tanaka also appeared in a video posted on the team's X account as Dodgers players and family members boarded a plane.
Late last month, Ohtani announced his marriage to a Japanese woman on Instagram but gave no details about his bride besides her nationality. At a press conference the following day he described her simply as a ""normal Japanese woman"". ""Ohtani's wife"" was the top trending topic on X, formerly known as Twitter, in Japan, after the photos were posted. National broadcaster NHK and top daily newspapers put the photo of the couple at the top of their web pages.
The Dodgers will play Korea Baseball Organization teams before facing the San Diego Padres next week. The teams are due to arrive at Seoul's Incheon International airport later on Friday. Ohtani, 29, won his second Most Valuable Player award last year after leading the American League with 44 home runs and notching 10 wins as a pitcher.
In December, he signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers after six years with the Angels.

This is what it’s like to live in North Korea’s firing line,"We are standing at a lookout where North Korean territory is faintly visible on the horizon. There is a distant thudding noise coming from somewhere out at sea, which Kim says is North Korean artillery fire. “Whenever I hear artillery fire, I get worried.”
Over the past week, North Korea’s reclusive leader has overseen military drills including simulations of storming border posts and demonstrations involving tanks. North Korean state media this week was full of images of Kim Jong-un surrounded by troops. Those drills came as the US and South Korea held annual joint military exercises of their own.
While Kim’s military posturing is nothing new for South Korea which has faced missile tests from the North for decades, the reclusive North Korean leader’s rhetoric is shifting. In January, he abandoned the doctrine of his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, and said Pyongyang would no longer seek peaceful reunification with Seoul. He described South Korea as a “hostile state” which needed to be annihilated.
While there are few in Seoul who believe Kim is suicidal enough to attack its more powerful neighbour, despite significant advances in his weapons capability in the past five years, security analysts say the change in language is evidence of a more confident dictator who has given up on negotiating with the West.

Diplomats and academics who met with AFR Weekend this week say South Korea is no longer up against an isolated and famine-ravaged regime, but a North Korea with powerful allies in Russia and China who share a common goal of destabilising the US-led world order.
“Ten to 15 years ago North Korea was an isolated regime, but today it is the dagger at the end of the bloc of authoritarian regimes, and it can do whatever it wants,” says Peter Lee, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a South Korean think tank.
“That makes it a far more dangerous threat to countries like South Korea and Japan, but also countries like Australia.”
Experts in Seoul who have been studying Kim and his family for decades say they are increasingly baffled by the unpredictable dictator’s motives. He is seen as less strategic and more prone to follow his ego than his father was. South Korea’s spy agency also believes he is grooming his 11-year-old daughter, Kim Ju Ae, as his successor. She is often seen accompanying him to military parades and missile tests.

At the same time, security experts warn he should not be underestimated, despite reports he is struggling to stem the flow of information about modern life in more affluent South Korea from his people.
Some believe the motivation for breaking with his grandfather’s principles by saying no unification for now and declaring that South Koreans are a different ethnic race instead of fellow countrymen is part of an effort to control the domestic narrative, which paints the North as a superior regime.
While Kim has historically sought to use his nuclear arsenal as leverage to negotiate sanctions relief, more recently his actions are seen to be driven by the shifting geopolitical landscape, where China and Russia are stepping up efforts to establish an alternative to the US-led world order.
“North Korean rhetoric and military exercises are telegraphing a potential kinetic provocation in the West Sea or against reconnaissance assets operating near its borders,” Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told AFR Weekend.
“Yet, North Korea is very unlikely to start a full-scale war when many of its soldiers are busy labouring on domestic construction projects, while Pyongyang is sending massive amounts of weapons to Russia, and as the US-South Korea alliance is strong.
“Instead, North Korea will attempt to politically divide its targets by raising tensions further during US and South Korean defence exercises and electoral campaigns.”
The heightened tensions in the region come ahead of South Korea’s legislative elections in April. While the polls will test President Yoon Suk-yeol’s authority, the outcome is unlikely to set back his efforts to deepen security ties with US allies such as Japan and Australia, or his more combative approach to manage North Korea’s sabre-rattling. Regardless of the election outcome, Yoon will remain in power until 2027.
The real game-changer, though, will be November’s US presidential elections. The very real possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House has many in Seoul worried.
Trump has warned the $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) that South Korea contributes to the cost of stationing US troops on the Korean Peninsula is not enough and wants an annual payment of $US5 billion. If Seoul refuses, Trump may threaten to pull its 28,500 US troops out. The Biden administration is now working to lock in a new agreement with Yoon’s government before the US election.

A former top Trump adviser, Alexander Gray, said in Tokyo this month that he did not believe the presidential candidate would abandon South Korea because it would not be in US interests. Not everyone is convinced, though.
“There is a lot of concern in Seoul about what a second Trump term might entail,” says the Asan Institute’s Lee. “That is partly because of how badly the country fared last time, but also because this alliance solidarity could become meaningless with a US administration that only cares about transactional bargaining.
“It would also put South Korea in a very vulnerable position vis-a-vis what overtures Mr Trump might send Kim Jong Un and his respect for leaders like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.”
Some of the residents on Yeonpyeong Island are also nervous about what Trump’s return to power means for the region.
“If Trump becomes president, it would not be good for South Korean national security. Trump is less concerned about South and North relations. Unlike Biden, Trump could just be a spectator if the North attacks the South,” Um Joo-sun, a 72-year-old retired construction engineer, says over coffee at the local bakery. “Me and my neighbours are living in constant fear about what will happen if the North attacks us.”
There are reminders everywhere on Yeonpyeong Island about Kim’s past attacks. The charred ruins of bombed-out houses in the middle of the main town have been turned into a museum charting attacks on the island in 1999, 2002 and 2010. Huge underground bunkers, some with hospital beds, power generators and rooms the size of a gymnasium, have been built into the sides of hills around town and can be occupied at any time.

Life here is a far cry from the world of K-pop, beauty salons and high-end department stores in Seoul. It is a quiet place with basic low-rise homes, many rebuilt after the 2010 attack, and rusting hulks of abandoned fishing vessels piled up on the shoreline. Most of the passengers on a ferry arriving from Seoul on the Saturday when the AFR Weekend visited were military personnel and their visiting families and girlfriends.
Like many frontier communities, the residents are faithful to their home and say they would not live anywhere else despite the island’s precarious position in geopolitics.

“Everywhere, there is the possibility of danger. Yes, we have been attacked, but this is our home and people make a living here. I don’t want people to see it as a war island,” says Kim Young-sun, 60, who works in the local observatory where tourists come to view North Korea from binoculars. Upstairs in the Island Cafe, a wall is covered with heart-shaped yellow and pink post-it notes full of messages from soldiers to their girlfriends and wives.
While she says she tries not to lose sleep about another attack, Kim believes the absence of Chinese fishing vessels in local waters since January is a worry. When they are present, the locals take it as a positive sign because they believe North Korea would alert China if its citizens were in danger.
Others, like tour guide Lee Myung-jae, 51, are still rattled by a 2010 artillery attack when she risked her life to run to the local school to find her then 10-year-old son.
“I was scared and had to hurry to protect my son. I was worried about my own safety too; I could have been killed,” she says.
In Seoul, the mood is more relaxed. While military service is compulsory for South Koreans, the country does not feel like it is on a war footing. Security analysts view the conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and potentially the South China Sea as more worrying.

Still, the shifting geopolitical tides and the uncertainty of a Trump presidency mean many are concerned. Two respected US analysts, former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker raised eyebrows in January when they published an article warning Kim had made a “strategic decision to go to war”. They estimate Kim has 50 to 60 nuclear warheads.
Some blame Yoon’s posturing and the West as much as Pyongyang for the heightened tensions.
“The ongoing power game between the US and China, coupled with the US’ strategic move to fortify its Indo-Pacific alliance on top of its NATO alliance to counter China, would worsen the tension and worsen the ongoing geopolitical tension across the world,” Yang Moo-jin, 63, president of the University of North Korean Studies, told AFR Weekend.
“One solution to defuse tension is for all stakeholders taking part in affairs with North Korea to adopt a balanced diplomatic approach and be willing to participate in an open dialogue, instead of instigating conflicts.

“I am very concerned that the tension in the Korean Peninsula would continue to escalate unless President Yoon Suk-yeol and Kim Jong-un take a step back and open up bilateral dialogue, while acknowledging each other’s interests.”
In its annual threat assessment, released this week, the US Intelligence Community concluded Kim hoped to use his closer ties with Russia to be accepted as a nuclear power.
“Today, it is pursuing stronger ties with China and Russia with the goal of increasing financial gains, diplomatic support, and defence co-operation. Kim almost certainly has no intentions of negotiating away his nuclear program, which he perceives to be a guarantor of regime security and national pride,” the report said.
It remains to be seen whether Trump will seek to reopen dialogue with Kim as he did with much fanfare during his last presidency. “Even if Trump returns to office, political reconciliation will be difficult while Kim looks to exploit cold war 2.0 geopolitics,” Easley says.
For the residents of Yeonpyeong Island, they are willing to hedge their bets, for now.
“I cannot say for sure whether it will happen again. I don’t know what is in Kim Jong Un’s mind. I can’t predict what he will do,” says tour guide Lee Myung-jae.",2024-03-15T01:02:32Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review
Quality time with dogs increases the power of brain waves associated with relaxation,"Spending quality time with dogs reduces stress and increases the power of brain waves associated with relaxation and concentration, according to a study published on March 13, 2024 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Onyoo Yoo from Konkuk University, South Korea, and colleagues.
Animal-assisted interventions, like canine therapy, are widely used in hospitals, schools, and beyond to help reduce anxiety, relieve stress, and foster feelings of trust. Studies of the potential benefits of animal interactions often take a holistic approach, comparing people's mood or hormone levels before and after spending time with a service animal. But this approach doesn't differentiate between types of interactions, like grooming, feeding, or playing with an animal, limiting our understanding of how each specific interaction impacts a person's health and well-being. To better understand how such animal-related activities affect mood, Yoo and colleagues recruited a small sample of 30 adult participants to each perform eight different activities with a well-trained dog, such as playing with a hand-held toy, giving her treats, and taking pictures with her. Participants wore electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes to record electrical activity from the brain while they interacted with the dog, and they recorded their subjective emotional state immediately following each activity.
The relative strength of alpha-band oscillations in the brain increased while participants played with and walked the dog, reflecting a state of relaxed wakefulness. When grooming, gently massaging, or playing with the dog, relative beta-band oscillation strength increased, a boost typically linked to heightened concentration. Participants also reported feeling significantly less fatigued, depressed, and stressed after all dog-related activities.
While not all participants had pets of their own, their fondness for animals likely motivated their willingness to participate in the experiment, potentially biasing the results. Nonetheless, the authors state that the unique relationships between specific activities and their physiological effects could serve as a reference for programming targeted animal-assisted interventions in the future.
The authors add: ""This study provides valuable information for elucidating the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of animal-assisted interventions.""",2024-03-14T19:16:00Z,https://www.news-medical.net,News-Medical.net

All England Championships: Lakshya Sen Reaches Quarters With Win Over Anders Antonsen,"India’s Lakshya Sen recorded a stunning three-game win over world no. 3 Anders Antonsen to progress to the quarterfinals but an error-prone PV Sindhu lost in the women’s singles second round of the All England Championships on Thursday.
The World No. 18 Sen, who had finished runner-up at the 2022 edition, fought his way back from a 2-8 deficit in the decider after losing the second game to prevail 24-22 11-21 21-14 over Antonsen, a three-time medallist at the World championships, in a controversial second round match.
Earlier Sindhu, a double Olympic medallist, seemed to be in good touch as she fought hard against the world No. 1 An Se Young of Korea but failed to curb her mistakes to slip to a 19-21, 11-21 loss.

It was the Indian’s seventh successive loss to the indomitable An Se Young, who had become the first Korean woman singles player to win the World Championships last year.
Sen came into the match with a 1-3 record against Antonsen, who had defeated the Indian in all the last three meetings.
But the Indian produced a good show and was leading 17-15 in the first game after some close battles initially. With two winners, Antonsen made it 17-17 but Sen was the first to gain two game points with a precise backhand flick at the corner.
The Indian squandered five-game points as Antonsen stayed alive.
Eventually, at 22-22, two power-packed smashes gave Sen his fifth game point and he sealed it this time when the Dane sprayed wide.
After the change of ends, Antonsen was on top of things, leading 11-7 at the break. The Dane kept a firm hold on the rallies as Sen committed too many errors and the second game slipped away quickly.

At 14-16, Antonsen was called for a fault for touching the net, which rattled the Dane. “Fault? Why? Touched the net? My racket or body?”, an animated Antonsen could be heard saying to the chair umpire.
Sen soon unleashed a forehand winner to move to 16-14, which he swelled to 18-14 when a defensive shot went wide from Antonsen.

"""Svartelistet"" etter Photoshop-tabben","Ikke lenger en pålitelig kilde, mener nyhetsdirektør, og trekker samtidig sammenligninger til Nord-Korea.
Søndag ble et bilde av prinsesse Kate trukket fra bildebyråer grunnet mistanke om manipulasjon. Mandag kom beklagelsen og erkjennelsen fra prinsessen.

Det ble delt i forbindelse med morsdagen. Det manipulerte bildet er fortsatt tilgjengelig på det kongelige-parets offisielle Instagram-konto, men med eksternt advarsel om at bildet er manipulert.

"North Korea says Kim Jong Un test drove a new tank, urged troops to complete ""preparations for war""","Seoul, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un joined troops training on a new tank model and drove one himself, state media reported Thursday, as his rivals South Korea and the U.S. wrapped up their annual military exercises. It's the third time Kim was reported to have observed military exercises since the start of the 11-day South Korean-U.S. drills, which he views as rehearsals for an invasion.
The visits with troops are a less provocative response from Kim than missile tests, which North Korea has ramped up since 2022, along with its belligerent rhetoric this year.
At the tank drills Wednesday, Kim praised the country's latest tank as ""the world's most powerful"" and told his troops to bolster their ""fighting spirits"" and complete ""preparations for war,"" according to the official Korean Central News Agency. The other two drills he inspected recently were dedicated to artillery firing and maneuvering exercises.

The tank was first unveiled during a military parade in 2020, and its rolling during Wednesday's drill indicates that it's ready to be deployed, South Korean experts said.
Photos of the tank released by North Korea show it has a launch tube for missiles — a weapons system the former Soviet Union already operated in the 1970s. The new tank could pose a threat to South Korea, said Yang Uk, an analyst at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, but it remained unclear whether North Korea has the capacity to mass produce the machines.
The North's Defense Ministry last week threatened ""responsible military activities"" in reaction to the South Korea-U.S. military drills, which involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last spring. The U.S. and South Korea have been expanding their training exercises in a tit-for-tat response to the North's weapons testing spree.
Concerns about North Korea's military preparations have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country's long-standing goal to seek peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and cement South Korea as its ""invariable principal enemy."" He said the new constitution must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war breaks out.
Kim's moves signal ""North Korea's fundamental change on its South Korea policy, beyond just rhetoric,"" as the North's previous push for inter-Korean unity had allowed it to make a steadfast call for the removal of U.S. troops in South Korea, a senior South Korean presidential official told a small group of reporters Monday. He requested anonymity, citing the delicate nature of the issue.
Observers say Kim likely wants to use his upgraded weapons arsenal to win U.S. concessions like extensive relief of international sanctions on North Korea. They say North Korea is expected to extend its testing activities and ramp up warlike rhetoric this year as South Korea holds parliamentary elections in April and the U.S. a presidential election in November.

Park Hyung-sik finds love in age of burnout with 'Doctor Slump',"1 of 3 | South Korean superstar Park Hyung-sik plays Yeo Jeong-woo, a successful plastic surgeon who has seen his life and career fall apart, in the Netflix rom-com ""Doctor Slump."" Photo courtesy of SLL/HighZium Studio
SEOUL, March 14 (UPI) -- Doctor Slump's Yeo Jeong-woo (Park Hyung-sik) seems to have it all -- he's a celebrity plastic surgeon with a successful practice and a massive social media following. But that perfect life comes tumbling down when a mishap during a surgical procedure leaves a patient dead. The once high-flying Jeong-woo suddenly finds himself saddled with debt, facing criminal charges and suffering from symptoms of PTSD. Advertisement
To make matters worse, he is thrust into an unwelcome reunion with his high school academic rival when he moves into a shabby rooftop apartment above Nam Ha-neul (Park Shin-hye).
Ha-neul, it turns out, is in a slump herself. Once on her way to a bright future as an anesthesiologist, her career has been derailed by an abusive boss and a clinical diagnosis of depression.
It's not exactly a classic setup for a romantic comedy, but Doctor Slump finds laughter and a love connection between characters who have fallen from grace. The series, produced by South Korean studio SLL, has struck a chord with audiences at home and abroad with its spotlight on the country's grueling work culture and cutthroat academic environment.
Advertisement
""I found that a lot of viewers were able to relate to the topics of the drama, which are slump and burnout,"" Park Hyung-sik told UPI.
Doctor Slump has topped the South Korean television charts since it premiered in late January and has been a fixture on Netflix's global Top 10 list.
Park Hyung-sik, a certified heartthrob whose credits include The Heirs, High Society, Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth, Strong Girl Bong-soon and Suits, said he was drawn to Doctor Slump for the way it addressed serious themes in ""an in-depth and entertaining way.""
The 32-year-old actor and singer said he could also relate to the challenges the characters face.
""There are times when I want to drop everything,"" he said. ""But I try not to let it consume me. I think I've done a good job of pulling myself together and focusing on something else as soon as I sense that.""
In Doctor Slump, the reunion of Jeong-woo and Ha-neul gets off to a rocky start, as both are instantly transported back to the intensity of their high school rivalry. In flashbacks, we see Ha-neul chugging packets of powdered coffee to fuel marathon study sessions, while Jeong-woo turns everything into a competition, from solving math equations at the chalkboard to simply walking to class.

But -- in classic Korean rom-com fashion -- the former enemies slowly turn into lovers as they bond over their shared misery. (A courtroom crime drama is a subplot, as Jeong-woo tries to figure out who is framing him for the operating room mishap.)
""I kept postponing everything and worked like a dog,"" Ha-neul says at one point. ""But look at me now. I slaved away and only ended up with depression.""
They find that stepping off the treadmill of high achievement gives them a chance to experience the simple pleasures in life that they never had time to enjoy -- like karaoke sessions, long walks under falling cherry blossoms and heartfelt conversations over countless bottles of soju.
""Let's take a break while we're at rock bottom,"" Jeong-woo says.
Doctor Slump's strongest appeal is undoubtedly the chemistry of its leads, who are among the most popular and prolific stars in South Korea. Their on-screen pairing also parallels a real-life reunion, as the two are working together for the first time since starring in The Heirs a decade ago.
""It felt familiar and new at the same time,"" Park Hyung-sik said. ""It was the first time we'd worked together for a long period, so it was new, but we quickly got in sync.""

And even when the tone is light and romantic, the series never lets go of its grounding in real-life problems -- including a straightforward portrayal of treating mental health challenges, which still carry a stigma in South Korea.
""Just as we see a doctor when we're injured or sick, I hope visiting a doctor for our mental illnesses is considered natural and this series will help it,"" he said.
Doctor Slump is streaming on Netflix, with the final two episodes of Season 1 set for release on Saturday and Sunday.",2024-03-14T14:28:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

There was a cap for “regular” subsidies when buying a carrier phone, but the cap was lifted

There’s an article in the Korean Ajunews , titled:A rough translation of the report claims that this is possible after changes to the Mobile Device Distribution Improvement Act, aiming to lower household communication costs.Changing mobile carriers (number portability) in South Korea now comes with the potential to receive an additional support of up to 500,000 KRW (South Korean won; 500,000 KRW are approximately $380) on top of “regular” subsidies. Until not so long ago, there was a cap for such “regular” subsidies (applied when purchasing a device through national carriers), but it was recently lifted Prior to the change, the government capped carrier subsidies at 240,000 KRW (~$180). Mobile carriers in South Korea are now alluring users with subsidies between 55,000 KRW ($42) and 500,000 KRW for a newdevice and a mobile plan.The biggest change is, of course, the provision of transition support funds. Korean carriers could now pay up to 500,000 KRW in transition support funds covering cancellation fees, SIM card issuance costs, and loss of long-term subscription benefits when changing rival plans.Considering this, if one were to port their number and purchase a, they could receive support totaling up to 1.15 million KRW in these new funds: “regular” subsidies and “transition” subsidies. Notably, some mobile retailers are offering additional, even higher subsidies at 15% of the carrier's, thus making in to 1.15 million KRW in total support. Since the basemodel is priced at 1.155 million KRW, it could essentially become a 'free phone'.Kim Hong-il, Chairman of the Korea Communications Commission, emphasized that these amendments aim to reduce the financial burden on consumers and encourage a more competitive market. However, whether this will invigorate true competition remains uncertain, as carriers show hesitance towards heavy subsidy investments.",2024-03-14T12:27:14Z,https://www.phonearena.com,PhoneArena

South Korea scientists tout cultured ‘beef rice’ as source of protein for the future,"SEOUL – South Korean researchers have grown beef cells in rice grains in what they say is a major step towards achieving a sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly source of protein that could replace farmed cattle for meat.
Professor Hong Jin-kee of Yonsei University in Seoul, who led the research published in the journal Matter this month, said the “beef rice” is the first product of its kind. It uses grain particles as the base for cultivating animal muscle and fat cells.
In the research, rice grains were treated with enzymes to create an optimal environment for cell growth, then infused with bovine cells that are cultivated to achieve the final hybrid product, which resembles a pinkish grain of rice.
The beef rice contains approximately 8 per cent more protein and 7 per cent more fat than conventional rice. Prof Hong noted the protein is 18 per cent animal-based, making it a rich source of essential amino acids.
The Yonsei team is not the first to work on lab-grown meat products. Companies around the world have launched cultivated meat; one of the latest involves plant-based chicken and eel cultivated from a soy base, marketed in Singapore.
Prof Hong’s team said rice has an advantage in terms of safety relative to soy or nuts because fewer people are allergic to it.
“If successfully developed into food products, cultured beef rice could serve as a sustainable protein source, particularly in environments where traditional livestock farming is impractical,” he said.
Priced at about US$2 (S$2.70) per kilogram, and with a far smaller carbon footprint than traditional beef products, cultured beef rice could compete on grocery shelves, Prof Hong said.
He said challenges remain from a technical standpoint and in terms of winning over customers with flavour and texture.
Diner Keum Dong-kyu, who recently sampled the rice beef at a Korean barbecue restaurant in Seoul, said the idea is innovative.
“But honestly, I don’t think it can replicate the juiciness or texture of real beef.”
Germany tourist Christian Krammel, who was more positive, said: “Now, it does not compare to beef yet, but as I see the research is in early stages, I would say it’s a great way forward.” REUTERS",2024-03-14T11:45:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times

On Thursday, U.S. and South Korean forces staged live-fire drills near the inter-Korean border, the South's Army said in a press release. The drills, which began last week, involved 300 personnel and South Korean K1A2 tanks, K21 armored vehicles and FA-50 fighter jets.
North Korea regularly condemns the allies' joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills in the past as a pretext for its own missile tests.
Last week, Kim oversaw an artillery firing drill that included a demonstration of long-range units with the range to bombard Seoul.
The United States and South Korea have increased their military cooperation over the past two years in response to the North's provocations, with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets such as aircraft carriers, a B-52 nuclear bomber and a nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the Korean Peninsula.",2024-03-14T06:44:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
North Korea’s Kim ‘drives’ new tank during mock battle,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a military demonstration involving a new battle tank, state media KCNA reported on Thursday, in the latest show of force by the isolated state as South Korea and the United States wrapped up joint drills.
Kim expressed “great satisfaction” that the new type of main battle tank successfully demonstrated its striking power in its first performance display on Wednesday, KCNA said.
The “training match” was designed to inspect the combat capabilities of tank crews and make them familiar with combat action on different tactical missions, it said.
“Swiftly weaving their way through various worst combat circumstances, heavy tanks hit targets at once with powerful strikes and broke through strong defence lines with high manoeuvrability,” the report said.
The 105th Tank Division, which was declared the winner of the mock battle, was the unit which occupied the South Korean capital Seoul during the Korean War, KCNA said.
Kim was joined by senior officials including Defence Minister Kang Sun Nam at the event.
In a photograph published by KCNA, the leader of the reclusive state could be seen with his head peaking out of a tank as the state media reported he drove the tank himself.
Meanwhile, other photographs showed Kim sporting a leather jacket and surrounded by troops, and also tanks with the North Korean flag blasting ammunition on a field.
The mock battle comes as joint annual drills involving South Korea and the U.S. were due to wrap up on Thursday. The drills, known as the Freedom Shield exercises, were the first to take place since Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military pact aimed at de-escalating tensions in November.
As part of the drills, South Korea’s army said the combined forces had conducted a joint live fire exercise at a training base in the city of Pocheon in the past week.
The live fire drill featured tanks, armoured cars as well as FA-50 fighter jets, the army said in a statement.
North Korea has long condemned such military drills as rehearsals for war, while Seoul has portrayed the exercises as purely defensive.
Kim’s appearance at the demonstration comes after he guided an artillery firing drill by the Korean People’s Army, the country’s military force, last week.
The drill involved units near the border that are in firing range of “the enemy’s capital,” KCNA said, referring to Seoul, which has nearly 10 million residents.",2024-03-14T05:04:31Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail
Kim Jong Un: इस देश पर अटैक की तैयारी कर रहा उत्तर कोरिया? तानाशाह किम जोंग उन करवा रहे सेना की जबरदस्त ट्रेनिंग!,"दक्षिण कोरिया की सीमा के पास ही ट्रेनिंग इस मीडिया रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक दक्षिण कोरिया (south Korea) की राजधानी सियोल में जहां करीब 10 मिलियन लोग रहते हैं, वहां की सीमा के पास ही किम जोंग उन सेना की हथियारों के साथ ट्रेनिंग करा रहे हैं। हैरानी की बात ये है कि इन हथियारों की ड्रिल में सीमा के पास की इकाइयां शामिल थीं, जो दक्षिण कोरिया की राजधानी सियोल की फायरिंग रेंज में हैं। रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक इस सैन्य प्रशिक्षण को टैंक कर्मचारियों की युद्ध क्षमताओं का कड़ाई से निरीक्षण करने के लिए किया था। ये इस तरह से डिजाइन किया गया था कि वो सच में एक युद्धक्षेत्र है और उत्तर कोरिया की सेना को युद्ध में जवाब देना है।

"Kensington Palace Not A 'Trusted Source' Amid Kate Middleton Photoshop Scandal, AFP Director Says","Topline
The global news director of Agence France-Presse, one of the world's biggest news agencies, told the BBC that Kensington Palace is no longer a ""trusted source"" after releasing a doctored photo of Kate Middleton and her three children, and said AFP’s decision to “kill” the photo of Middleton was a rare, dramatic move normally reserved for North Korean or Iranian propaganda.
A picture shows stories in Britain's national newspapers about the altered mother's day photo ... [+] released by Kensington Palace on March 10. AFP via Getty Images
Key Facts
Phil Chetwynd, global news director of AFP, told Ros Atkins of BBC Radio 4’s ""The Media Show” that the agency works with Kensington Palace “all the time” and it was considered to be a “trusted source” before it provided the altered photo of Kate and her children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. AFP, the Associated Press and other news wires issued a “kill notice” for the photo on Sunday, asking its member sources to stop circulating the picture because it had been altered to a degree that it no longer met ethical standards—a dramatic move that Chetwynd said has previously been taken for news issued by the ""North Korean news agency or the Iranian news agency, to give you some background or context.” To issue a kill notice is a “big deal,” he added, saying that “to kill something on the basis of manipulation” is rare and happens maybe once per year. Chetwynd said AFP asked Kensington Palace for the original, unaltered photo or photos and did receive a reply. When asked if the palace was still to be trusted as a source, Chetwynd answered candidly: “No. Absolutely not. Like with anything, when you’re let down by a source, the bar is raised and we’ve got major issues internally.”
Key Background
Public interest in the whereabouts of Kate Middleton has continued to grow since Kensington Palace in January announced she had been hospitalized for a planned abdominal surgery and would postpone all of her upcoming engagements while she recovered, which could take months. Before the announcement, the Princess of Wales had not been seen or heard from since Christmas Day. After the surgery, Kate is said to have returned home to Windsor on Jan. 29 to continue her recovery. As public speculation about her health and whereabouts continued to grow, Kensington Palace on Sunday, March 10, released a photo of Kate and her three children to celebrate Mother’s Day in the United Kingdom. The palace said the photo was taken by Prince William, Kate's husband. Almost immediately, eagle-eyed royal watchers noticed a number of odd inconsistencies in the photo that suggested it had been majorly edited or altered. That same day, agencies like AFP and the Associated Press issued the kill notices, asking news agencies to stop circulating the photo because it “appeared the source had manipulated the image."" AFP said the modifications made to the photo were in ""violation of the ethical standards of the profession."" The next day, Monday, Kate issued an apology for causing “confusion” and said she occasionally experiments with editing images like “many amateur photographers.”
Crucual Quote
“It’s actually not even very well photoshopped. There are clearly a lot of issues with the photo,” Chetwynd said. “It shouldn’t have been validated. I think as soon as it was, all of the photo editors at all of the major agencies immediately saw there was a problem and got together and spoke about it and said ‘what do we do?’”
What To Watch For
Another update from the palace. In seeming response to the backlash of the edited photo release on Sunday, Middleton was photographed in the backseat of a car leaving Windsor Castle the next day. That photo, taken by photo agency Goff Photos, is also under scrutiny for photo editing. The agency has denied doctoring the photo. Kate has not been seen since and Kensington Palace has issued no other statements on her wellbeing or whereabouts.

Founder Of Chip-Testing Firm Rides AI Boom To Become South Korea’s Newest Billionaire,"Lee Chae-yoon, Leeno Industrial's founder and CEO. COURTESY OF LEENO
I nvestor frenzy over artificial intelligence boosted shares of Leeno Industrial, an under-the-radar semiconductor company in South Korea, by more than 70% since November. The stock surge has made Lee Chae-yoon, the company’s founder and CEO, South Korea’s newest billionaire—and the second in the country, home to some of the biggest names in the chip industry that makes AI work, to be minted from the AI boom.
With a 35% stake, Lee, 73, is the largest shareholder of Leeno Industrial, which is listed on South Korea’s technology-rich Kosdaq stock exchange. Forbes estimates Lee’s net worth at $1 billion as of Thursday’s stock market close.
Based in the southern port city of Busan, Leeno makes parts for semiconductor-testing equipment that checks chips for defects. The company’s main products are IC Test Socket, which helps test chips to ensure they work, and Leeno Pin, a pin that helps check for defects in chips and printed circuit boards. Leeno says it has 1,020 customers globally, including Jay Y. Lee’s (no relation to Lee Chae-yoon) Samsung Electronics, Chey Tae-won’s SK Hynix and Jensen Huang’s Nvidia.
Like many companies in the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry, Leeno reported a fall in revenue and earnings in 2023 amid weak demand for smartphones and personal computers. For the first nine months of 2023, the chip testing maker reported that revenue dropped 27% year-over-year to 197.6 billion won ($151 million), while net income fell 21.4% from the previous year to 83.5 billion won.
But investors believe the AI boom, powered by Nvidia’s graphics processing unit chips, will boost Leeno’s earnings. A similar scenario has played out at Hanmi Semiconductor, which saw its shares jump 600% in the past 12 months despite a drop in earnings and revenue in 2023. The stock surge, driven by investor optimism that its semiconductor-manufacturing equipment will be used to make chips for AI, made Kwak Dong Shin, the company’s CEO and largest shareholder, a billionaire last July.
“The emergence of new devices such as on-devices, and that the demand for R&D is increasing due to the fact that Meta, Google, Amazon, etc., are developing their own NPUs, will be a positive sign for the company’s future performance,” Jessica Kwag, a senior analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities who has a buy rating on Leeno, said in an emailed comment about the company’s stock-price rise. NPUs, or neural processing units, are chips designed for deep and machine learning applications.
“I also think the stock performed well because this very conservative company has a lot of room for improvement, given its plans to double the capacity,” Kwag added. In December 2022, Leeno announced it had acquired a 72,519-square-meter industrial facility in Busan for 75.5 billion won (about $60 million) to expand its production capacity.
In its third-quarter report, Leeno said demand for semiconductor-testing equipment is rising, driven by technological trends like AI, Internet of Things, AR, VR and autonomous driving.
Lee founded Leeno—the name is a combination of Lee’s and his wife’s surnames—in 1978, nine years after graduating from Kwangsung Engineering High School in Busan. The company listed on Korea’s technology-rich Kosdaq stock exchange in 2001. In 2018, Lee was appointed chairman of the regional innovation council in Busan, South Korea’s second-biggest city.
Lee is the latest Asian billionaire to make a fortune from the semiconductor sector. Other chip billionaires in the region include Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s largest maker of advanced chips, and Tsai Ming-kai of Taiwan chip designer MediaTek. In South Korea, Jay Y. Lee’s Samsung Electronics is the world’s largest memory-chip maker and the only other contract chip manufacturer besides TSMC capable of making today’s most advanced chips. South Korean Chey Tae-won’s SK Hynix is the world’s No. 2 memory-chip manufacturer. The Uchiyama family of Tokyo-based Lasertec, a semiconductor-testing equipment maker, feature among Japan’s 50 Richest.

Prøvekjøringen skal ha skjedd under det som omtales som en treningskamp mellom ulike stridsvognbataljoner i Nord-Korea.
Det sørkoreanske nyhetsbyrået Yonhap skriver at stridsvognen ser ut til å være en oppgradert versjon av en stridsvogn som ble vist frem for første gang under en militærparade i oktober 2020.

Spending time with a dog can help to relieve stress: study,"No arf-ing kidding.
Any canine owner can tell you that dogs relieve stress — now, a new study backs them up.
Researchers from Konkuk University in South Korea discovered that spending time with dogs helps people relax and concentrate.
Dogs really do make people feel less stressed. Shutterstock
For the study, published in Plos One, the experts recruited 30 adults and measured their brainwaves via electrode headsets, while they interacted with a lovable poodle named Aro.
They did the following eight activities with Aro for 3 minutes each: meeting, walking, playing, feeding, hugging, massaging and photographing.
Researchers found that walking a dog made a person feel more relaxed, brushing a dog improved participants’ concentration and playing with a dog yielded all of the above.
When playing with Aro and a squeaky toy, researchers had stronger alpha brain waves, which are associated with relaxation. Walking her in a park trail also produced alpha waves.
When participants brushed the dog and massaged her they produced more beta brain waves, which are correlated with concentration.
The researchers also asked people how they felt after each activity with Aro and they all reported feeling less stress and depressed.
The participants all said that their moods improved after hugging Aro and feeding her treats.

“This study demonstrated that specific dog activities could activate stronger relaxation, emotional stability, attention, concentration and creativity by facilitating increased brain activity,” the study authors wrote.
This isn’t the first study to show that spending time with dogs is good for people’s mental health.
A 2022 study published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology found that spending just 20 minutes with an animal can decrease cortisol, the stress hormone, and increase oxytocin, the hormone associated with love and bonding.

North Korea’s Kim test drives new tank and orders troops to prepare for war,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un joined troops training on a new tank model and drove one himself, state media reported Thursday, as his rivals South Korea and the US wrapped up their annual military exercises.
It is the third time Mr Kim was reported to have observed military exercises since the start of the 11-day South Korean-US drills, which he views as rehearsals for an invasion.

At the tank drills on Wednesday, Mr Kim praised the country’s latest tank as “the world’s most powerful” and told his troops to bolster their “fighting spirits” and complete “preparations for war,” according to the official Korean Central News Agency.

The other two drills he inspected recently were dedicated to artillery firing and manoeuvring exercises.
The tank was first unveiled during a military parade in 2020, and its rolling during Wednesday’s drill indicates that it is ready to be deployed, South Korean experts say.
Photos of the tank released by North Korea show it has a launch tube for missiles, a weapons system the former Soviet Union already operated in the 1970s.

The new tank could pose a threat to South Korea, said Yang Uk, an analyst at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, but it remains to be seen whether it can be mass-produced.

The North’s Defence Ministry last week threatened “responsible military activities” in reaction to the South Korea-US military drills, which involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last spring.

The US and South Korea have been expanding their training exercises in a tit-for-tat response to the North’s weapons testing spree.
Concerns about North Korea’s military preparations have deepened since Mr Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country’s long-standing goal to seek peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and cement South Korea as its “invariable principal enemy”.

He said the new constitution must specify that North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.

Mr Kim’s moves signal “North Korea’s fundamental change on its South Korea policy, beyond just rhetoric,” as the North’s previous push for inter-Korean unity had allowed it to make a steadfast call for the removal of US troops in South Korea, a senior South Korean presidential official told a small group of reporters Monday.
Observers say Mr Kim likely wants to use his upgraded weapons arsenal to win US concessions like extensive relief of international sanctions on North Korea.
They say North Korea is expected to extend its testing activities and ramp up warlike rhetoric this year as South Korea holds parliamentary elections in April and the US a presidential election in November.
“The South Korean-US training is over, but the North’s isn’t over yet,” Mr Yang said. “They won’t just stand still … they’ve been talking about war.”",2024-03-14T00:00:00Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie,BreakingNews.ie
"US-South Korea defense talks on track, but November not a hard deadline-US official","U.S.-South Korean talks on sharing the cost of keeping American troops in South Korea are on track and ahead of schedule, but the U.S. side does not necessarily see a hard deadline ahead of the November U.S. election, a senior Biden administration official told Reuters.
The two sides named envoys this month to launch a new early round of talks for a deal to take effect in 2026. South Korean media said the aim was for an agreement before any comeback by Donald Trump, who during his presidency accused Seoul of ""free-riding"" on U.S. military might. Trump
demanded Seoul pay as much as $5 billion a year for the deployment of some 28,500 American troops as part of efforts to deter nuclear-armed North Korea. The U.S. official said the talks were ""very much on track and ahead of schedule.""
""I can't say at this moment quite how soon they'll wrap, but we are not seeing major hurdles. And we're seeing a lot of political will on both sides,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We're fairly confident that our incentives are aligned, and that we will get these negotiations done. So we'd like to make quick progress, but ... don't necessarily see November as a hard deadline.""
South Korea began shouldering the costs of U.S. deployments, used to fund local labor, the construction of military installations and other logistics support, in the early 1990s. The current agreement is set to expire in 2025, with negotiations on a successor pact usually held just before the end of the existing one.
During Trump's presidency, both sides had struggled for months to make progress, before reaching a deal when Seoul agreed to increase its contribution by 13.9%, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades. Trump is set to face off against President Joe Biden in the November election.
A senior South Korean presidential official said this week Seoul expects no fundamental shift in relations with the United States even if U.S. voters elect a new president, but hopes to make progress on defense cost-sharing talks and other issues this year.

Korea Sets Release of Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' With Robert Pattinson,"South Korean cinema-goers will get a three-day jump on the rest of the world when the Bong Joon-ho-directed “Mickey 17” releases in January 2025 in time for the Lunar New Year holidays.
Warner Bros. Pictures says that the Robert Pattinson-starring sci-fi film will open in Korea on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, ahead of its global outing on Jan. 31.
The film was originally announced as opening in cinemas in March 2024, but WBD recently pushed that back by nine months to allow the picture to be completed. Production had been affected by Hollywood’s writers’ and actors’ strikes in 2023.
“Mickey 17” is Bong’s first feature as director since “Parasite,” which became the first non-English language movie to win best picture at the Oscars. In addition to writing and directing, Bong also produces the upcoming film through his company Offscreen. Additional producers include Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner of Plan B and Dooho Choi of Kate Street Pictures.
The film is adapted from Edward Ashton’s 2022 novel, described by publisher St. Martin Press as a high-concept cerebral thriller in the vein of “The Martian” and “Dark Matter.” Pattinson plays an “expendable” — a disposable employee on a human expedition sent to colonize an ice planet — who refuses to let his replacement clone take his place. The cast also includes Naomi Ackie, Steven Yeun, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo.
“Director Bong’s creativity, vision and imagination always exceed expectations. ‘Mickey 17’ will surprise audiences with its original story and characters, unpredictable plot development and humor, as well as great production qualities. Korea, director Bong’s mother country, was our first choice in terms of where to debut the film. All of us here at Warner Bros. are very excited to share ‘Mickey 17’ with audiences in Korea and beyond,” said Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, president of international distribution Andrew Cripps.",2024-03-13T23:01:04Z,https://variety.com,Variety

The military event was designed to strictly inspect the actual combat capabilities of tank crews and make them familiar with combat action methods on different tactical missions, KCNA reported.
""Swiftly weaving their way through various worst combat circumstances, heavy tanks hit targets at once with powerful strikes and broke through strong defense lines with high maneuverability,"" the report said. Kim was joined by senior officials including Defence Minister Kang Sun Nam at the event.
The leader of the reclusive state was pictured in one photo sporting a leather jacket surrounded by troops in front of a tank. In another, multiple tanks with the North Korean flag were firing ammunition on a field. Kim also emphasised the need to organise intensive exercises simulating an actual war and training matches for enhancing combat capability to be able to carry out any combat mission promptly and accurately in any contingency.
Kim's appearance at the demonstration came days after he guided an artillery firing drill by the Korean People's Army, the country's military force, last week. The drill involved units near the border that are in firing range of ""the enemy's capital,"" KCNA said, referring to South Korean capital Seoul, which has nearly 10 million residents.

"Hyundai, Kia to recall nearly 1,70,000 electric vehicles over possibility of abrupt breakdown during driving","Follow us on Image Source : AP Hyundai
Hyundai Motor and its sister company Kia Corp will recall about 1,70,000 electric vehicles (EVs) over problems with software in the charging systems. The recall was announced by the automobile giant and was echoed by South Korea's transport ministry on Thursday after several complaints.
Hyundai will recall 1,13,916 EVs in the country, affecting five EV models, including Ioniq-series and Genesis models, the ministry said. Kia will recall 56,016 EVs.
Why did Hyundai, Kia announce the recall?
Errors have been found in the software of the integrated charging control units used in 1,70,000 Hyundai and Kia EVs, which could make it difficult to power a low-voltage battery and lead to the possibility that the vehicles could stop while driving, the ministry said.
""Hyundai Motor and Kia will take prompt actions to prevent customer inconvenience and will continue to prioritize the safety of our customers and their vehicles,"" Hyundai Motor Group said in a statement.
The voluntary recalls are due to start on March 18.
Kia, and Hyundai recalled their cars in US last year
Earlier last year, Hyundai and Kia recalled nearly 3.4 million vehicles in the US and suggested owners park them outside due to the risk of engine compartment fires. The recalls cover multiple car and SUV models from the 2010 through 2019 model years including Hyundai’s Santa Fe SUV and Kia’s Sorrento SUV.
The automakers had advised owners to park outdoors and away from structures until repairs were done. The company took the major step after Hyundai reported 21 fires in the affected vehicles in the US, and another 22 “thermal incidents” including smoke, burning and melting of parts, the documents say. Kia reported 10 fires and melting incidents.

North Korea: Kim Jong Un hosts ‘training match’ with new battle tank days after firing drill near North Korea’s Seoul,"North Korea has showcased its military strength through a tank demonstration led by its leader, Kim Jong Un. This exercise was reported on March 14 by state media KCNA.
It highlighted Kim's involvement and satisfaction with the performance of a new battle tank. This marks the tank's debut in demonstrating its capabilities. KCNA called it a “training match"".
Kim Jong Un, along with Defence Minister Kang Sun Nam and other top officials, observed as tank units manoeuvred through challenging simulated combat conditions. These tanks showed precision in hitting targets and agility in breaking through defensive lines.
“Swiftly weaving their way through various worst combat circumstances, heavy tanks hit targets at once with powerful strikes and broke through strong defense lines with high maneuverability,"" Reuters quoted the report as stating.
The demonstration aimed to evaluate the combat readiness of the tank crews and acquaint them with various combat strategies for different tactical missions. By simulating realistic war scenarios, the exercise intended to refine the combat capabilities of these units, ensuring they can execute missions swiftly and effectively under any circumstances.
Kim stressed the importance of conducting rigorous drills that mimic real-war situations. Such exercises are crucial for enhancing the military's overall combat proficiency. It enables the country to respond promptly and accurately to any emergency.
‘Enemy’s capital'
This military display comes shortly after Kim Jong Un directed an artillery firing drill near the border. The exercise included units stationed close to the border, within striking distance of ""the enemy's capital"", as per KCNA.
It referred to Seoul, the capital of South Korea, which is home to almost 10 million people.

MAX and Le Sserafim’s Huh Yunjin Team up on ‘Stupid in Love’: Watch,"MAX is totally stupid in love, and Le Sserafim’s Huh Yunjin is helping him spread the word.
The pop singer, songwriter and actor (real name: Max Schneider) teams up with the K-pop icon on “Stupid in Love,” the opening track on his new album Love In Stereo.
The fresh cut is bursting with pop vitality, and, since the stroke of midnight, is accompanied with an official music video that follows Max on his travels from Los Angeles, CA to Seoul, South Korea where the pair get down to moving and grooving for the cameras.

“Stupid in Love” came about in a moment of serendipity. Max made his own luck; he was visiting South Korea to work with a producer on music for BTS, when one of the lads suggested the idea of a collaboration with Le Sserafim.
He showed up to a meeting, “and they gave me this gift, which is a really beautiful thing in Korea — a lot of times you give your gift as an album and write a letter,” he tells People. “Yunjin wrote me a letter, and it was like, ‘I hope we get to meet and work together,'” he recounts. “It was really endearing, so I extended my trip to see her live.” The connections run deeper than a love of pop music; both artists were raised in New York.
Trending on Billboard
Le Sserafim is hot right now. The South Korean pop group became a Billboard Hot 100-charting act for the first time this year, thanks to the single, “Easy,” debuting at No. 99.
The group’s five-track EP of the same name bowed at No. 8 on the Billboard 200. Also, Easy started at No. 2 on both the World Albums and Top Album Sales charts, while the title track roared to No. 6 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, marking the group’s second, and top charting, top 10 effort.
Max enjoyed a breakthrough with his tender pop hit “Lights Down Low” featuring gnash, which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart back in 2016. The New Yorker has also collaborated with the likes of BTS and bandmate Suga, Hayley Kiyoko, Noah Cyrus and Chromeo, many of whom assisted on his 2020 project, Colour Vision.

Samsung reveals two mega budget Android phones with a major premium upgrade and battery that 'lasts two days',"SAMSUNG has launched a pair of smartphones that won't break the bank despite flaunting some premium level features.
It's been a busy year for the Korean tech giant already, having launched big AI boasting Samsung Galaxy S24 phones in January.
1 Samsung's new phones start from £339 Credit: Samsung
But now it's time for some new arrivals in the mid-range price point.
The two new devices are called the Galaxy A55 5G and the Galaxy A35 5G.
It's the first time Samsung has included its top level security upgrades on the budget Galaxy A series of handsets.
And there's also a killer battery that Samsung claims can last up to two days on a single charge.
They flaunt improved cameras capable of taking better snaps in the dark too.
Both are secured by Samsung Knox, the company's multi-layer security platform that's designed to keep critical information safe and protect against bank-raiding vulnerabilities.
A 5000mAh battery is on board - which is the same size as the company's top-of-the-range Galaxy S24 Ultra and bigger than any iPhone battery too.
The only real difference between the two is a slightly different chipset under the hood to power things - the A55 is a bit stronger on that front.
And the cameras aren't identical either, with the selfie cam coming in at 32-megapixels on the A55 compared to 13-megapixels on the A35.
Aside from that, they look exactly the same with a 6.6-inch display and four colour options.
The Samsung Galaxy S24 has a number of big AI features
These include:
Awesome Ice Blue
Awesome Lemon
Awesome Lilac
Awesome Navy
""Our ambition is to bring the latest technologies to everyone,"" explained James Kitto, Vice President and Head of MX Division, Samsung UK and Ireland.
""We’re really pleased to be opening up even more possibilities on our competitively priced Galaxy A series devices, including offering Samsung Knox Vault for the first time on this line-up, meaning that users can enjoy our outstanding mobile experiences with even more confidence and security.""
Prices start at £339, depending on the model and storage size you go for.
Both are available to buy from March 20.

"Russia Could Soon Receive More Weapons From North Korea, Analysts Say","Maritime shipments of North Korean weapons to Russia appear to have resumed after a monthlong pause.
Satellite imagery appears to show Russia-flagged cargo ships return to the North Korean city of Rason, which it and three other U.S.-sanctioned vessels have visited dozens of times since last summer to take on suspected war materiel destined for the Ukrainian battlefield, North Korea-focused analyst group NK Pro wrote Monday.
Washington has accused Pyongyang of aiding Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which reached the two-year mark on February 24.
The Kim Jong Un regime's munitions factories have been running at full capacity, with more than 6,700 containers carrying millions of munitions believed to have been shipped to Russia in exchange for essential resources like food, according to South Korean defense authorities.
Howitzers with Russia's 9th Guards Artillery Brigade fire at the Luzhsky training ground near Saint Petersburg, Russia. Ukrainian intelligence has said Russia has imported some 1.5 million artillery rounds from North Korea. Howitzers with Russia's 9th Guards Artillery Brigade fire at the Luzhsky training ground near Saint Petersburg, Russia. Ukrainian intelligence has said Russia has imported some 1.5 million artillery rounds from North Korea.
Newsweek reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry and North Korean Embassy in China with written requests for comment.
Sunday marked the first time since February 12 that near-daily satellite surveillance imagery captured a ship at either port.
Medium-resolution photos provided to NK Pro by Planet Labs appear to show cranes removing containers from a vessel matching the description of the Lady R that was docked at Rason Port's Pier 1, where the Russian ships have in the past offloaded cargo before being loaded at Pier 2.
Items believed to be containers earmarked for export began accumulating at Pier 2 in the two days before the suspected Russian vessel arrived, which is consistent with past shipments.
Newsweek could not independently confirm the ship in question was the Lady R.
Past analysis traced the Lady R to Russia's Vostochny, where it was loaded with containers early last month, then to waters east of country's far-eastern port city of Vladivostok. There the ship remained until it disappeared between March 7 and 9, just before its alleged reappearance at Rason.
Russia is already expanding its own munitions production to maintain its ground operations in Ukraine. Despite the expansion, fluctuating shortages, especially of artillery ammunition like 152-millimeter shells, challenging Russia's long-term military effectiveness in the conflict.
Ukrainian defense intelligence agency Main Intelligence Directorate, also known as GUR, estimated last month that Russia had imported some 1.5 million artillery shells from its reclusive neighbor.
""But these munitions are from the 70s and 80s. Half of them do not function, and the rest require either restoration or inspection before use,"" the agency's No. 2 said.
Pyongyang has been signaling strengthened ties with Moscow while shelving attempts to lower the temperature on the Korean Peninsula, where North-South relations are at their most unstable in decades.

Queste celle trasparenti possono trasformare le finestre in panneli solari: i dati sulla perovskite,"Queste celle trasparenti possono trasformare le finestre in panneli solari: i dati sulla perovskite Il Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) ha annunciato di aver raggiunto livelli record in termini di potenza ed efficienza nelle celle solari in perovskite semitrasparenti. L’obiettivo dei ricercatori è ovviare ai principali limiti dei pannelli fotovoltaici attualmente disponibili, ovvero la necessità di spazio e l’impatto estetico.

Nel cammino verso la neutralità carbonica, ovvero il raggiungimento dell'equilibrio tra le emissioni prodotte e l'assorbimento di carbonio, le energia rinnovabili svolgeranno un ruolo decisivo. Tra tutte, ricercatori e ingegneri stanno puntando soprattutto sul potenziamento degli strumenti per sfruttare l'energia solare, oggi considerata la fonte primaria per la realizzazione della transizione energetica e la decarbonizzazione.
Una buona notizia su questo fronte arriva dalla Corea del Sud, dove l'ente di ricerca nazionale, il Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER), ha appena raggiunto un importante traguardo in fatto di tecnologie all'avanguardia per lo stoccaggio di energia solare. Gli scienziati dell'istituto hanno infatti annunciato un passo avanti nella progettazione delle celle solari in perovskite semitrasparente.
Si tratta di un particolare minerale che per le sue particolari proprietà potrebbe rivoluzionare il settore del fotovoltaico, come già diversi progetti e ricerche stanno dimostrando. Quella sulle celle solare semitrasparenti è una di queste.

Le novità dalla Corea del Sud
Gli scienziati del KIER hanno annunciato di aver raggiunto un nuovo record di efficienza e potenza nelle celle solari in perovskite: i dati da loro ottenuti parlano di un'efficienza del 21,68%, che le rende le più efficienti tra le celle solari di perovskite che utilizzano elettrodi trasparenti al mondo. Inoltre, queste sarebbero in grado di conservare l'energia solare che immagazzinano a lungo, garantendo il 99% della loro efficienza iniziale fino dopo 240 ore di funzionamento.
Queste celle semitrasparenti potrebbero rappresentare una svolta nel settore dell'energia solare, perché una volta installate nelle finestre di edifici e abitazioni potrebbero trasformare quest'ultime in collettori di energia solare, perfettamente integrate nell'ambiente. In poche parole e semplificando la questione, questo potrebbe significare trasformare le finestre in pannelli solari.
Le potenzialità delle celle solari semitrasparenti
Per trasformare i realtà questo progetto – spiegano gli scienziati coreani – e fabbricare queste celle solari di perovskite semitrasparente è necessario sostituire gli elettrodi metallici che costituiscono le celle solari opache convenzionali con elettrodi trasparenti che permettono alla luce di passare.
Tuttavia realizzare questo passaggio non è stato così facile: i primi test compiuti su materiali semitrasparenti hanno infatti mostrato una netta riduzione delle proprietà di trasporto della carica e della stabilità delle celle. Sebbene inizialmente le cause del problema non fossero chiare, attraverso particolari studi in laboratorio gli scienziati coreani sono riusciti prima a identificare il problema e poi a risolverlo.
Il team di ricerca ha poi applicato i risultati ottenuti in laboratorio nella realtà, avviando la produzione delle prime celle solari tandem bifacciali del Paese che utilizzano la luce riflessa dalla parte posteriore e quell'incidente dalla superficie anteriore.
Il settore delle celle solari di perovskite semitrasparenti è da qualche anno oggetto di forti interessi e investimenti perché potrebbe rappresentare una soluzione a quelli che sono oggi i principali ostacoli a un'applicazione massiva dei pannelli fotovoltaici: ovvero la disponibilità di spazio fisico che richiedono per l'installazione e il loro impatto estetico sul paesaggio, un aspetto quest'ultimo criticato da molti.
Trasformare delle comuni finestre in collettori di energia solari, come promettono di fare le celle solari in perovskite, potrebbe offrire una soluzione capace di integrarsi con l'ambiente e senza richiedere spazi aggiuntivi appositi.",2024-03-12T12:08:23Z,https://www.fanpage.it,Fanpage.it
"On the Tripwire of a ‘Red Line,’ It’s Often Presidents Who Trip","When President Biden declared over the weekend that he was drawing a “red line” for Israel’s military action in Gaza, he appeared to be trying to raise the potential cost for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as their relationship plummets to new depths.
But he never said what would happen, exactly, if Mr. Netanyahu ignored him and continued Israel’s military operation by invading the southern city Rafah, a step that Mr. Biden has said — repeatedly — would be a major mistake. It is unclear whether he hesitated because he did not want to signal what response he might be preparing, or because he did not want to be criticized if he backed away from whatever action he is contemplating.
Or perhaps, given his long experience in the Senate and the White House, he remembered that drawing red lines turned out badly for Barack Obama when it came to Syria, and for George W. Bush when it came to North Korea and Iran. American allies in the Middle East were stunned by Mr. Obama’s reversal. Mr. Bush was later judged to have invaded a country that had no nuclear weapons — Iraq — while the North tested its first nuclear weapon on his watch.
Mr. Biden’s line-drawing was immediately dismissed — and matched — by Mr. Netanyahu, who shot back: “You know, I have a red line. You know what the red line is? That Oct. 7 doesn’t happen again.” The prime minister was referring, of course, to the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel, left scores more as hostages and precipitated a war now in its sixth month.",2024-03-12T10:13:41Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
KGM Torres EVX: Neuer elektrischer Geländewagen aus Korea im Test,"Ssangyong war gestern KGM Torres EVX im Test: Es muss nicht immer Kia oder Hyundai sein Von dpa Aktualisiert am 12.03.2024 - 08:31 Uhr Lesedauer: 3 Min. Torres EVX: Der Geländewagen wurde nach einem Nationalpark in Chile benannt. (Quelle: KGM/KGM/dpa/dpa-bilder) News folgen
Nach einer Umbenennung mischt das koreanische Unternehmen KGM im wachsenden Markt der elektrischen Geländewagen mit. Der Torres EVX ist der erste.
Koreanische Elektroautos gibt es mittlerweile reichlich, und alle paar Wochen kommt ein neues dazu. Im Mai rollt der Torres EVX an die Ladesäule zu einem Schätzpreis im mittleren fünfstelligen Euro-Bereich (vermutlich rund um die 40.000er-Marke). Der elektrische Geländewagen kommt von der kleinsten, aber zugleich ältesten Automarke Koreas – und die war bislang als Ssangyong bekannt.
Doch nachdem Ssangyong pleite war, hat der Stahlkocher KG das Unternehmen übernommen, noch ein M für Mobility ans Kürzel gehängt und die Marke fit für den Neuanfang gemacht.
Den Aufbruch signalisiert der Torres, der als Geländewagen von 4,72 Metern in der Mittelklasse antritt – und nach den Verbrennern nun erstmals auch mit Elektroantrieb angeboten wird.
Ecken und Kanten, die auffallen
Zwar blicken die Koreaner damit hoffnungsfroh in die Zukunft, sind beim Design aber erfreulich rückständig. Denn während die allermeisten elektrischen Geländewagen mit Rücksicht auf die Reichweite zu Stromlinien-SUV im Raumschiff-Look geworden sind, leistet sich der Torres weiter Ecken und Kanten und damit Charakter.
Ja, auch er hat eine LED-Leiste im Kühlergrill, mit der auf modern macht. Doch lassen sich die Designer vom sauberen Antrieb nicht die Abenteuerlust austreiben. Stattdessen haben sie ihm eine Front gezeichnet, die rustikaler wirkt als etwa bei Land Rover Defender oder Mercedes G-Klasse. Sie leisten sich sogar Haltegriffe auf der Haube, wie man sie sonst nur beim Ford Bronco findet.
Zudem gibt es am Heck zumindest als Blechwulst die Andeutung eines außen angeschlagenen Ersatzrades, selbst wenn der Torres damit von hinten weniger gelungen aussieht als von vorn, weil die Täuschung eben auf den ersten Blick auffällt.
Groß, bunt und digital: So sieht es innen aus
So hartgesotten und abenteuerlustig der nach einem Nationalpark in Chile benannte Geländewagen außen auch auftreten mag, so modern und zivil geht es innen zu. Der Torres bietet bei 2,68 Metern Radstand auch ohne die bei reinen Elektroautos übliche Skateboard-Plattform nicht nur ausreichend Platz für Kind und Kegel. Zudem lässt sich der Kofferraum mit 703 bis 1.662 Litern als vergleichsweise groß bezeichnen.
Und obendrein findet sich eine überraschend vornehme sowie bisweilen erstaunlich farbenfrohe Materialauswahl. Das Digitalcockpit ist schlank samt großem Touchscreen, mit kabellosen Ladeschalen und jeder Menge bisweilen etwas aufdringlicher Assistenzsysteme.
Unterwegs mit Strom: Was der Akku kann
Der Antrieb des Torres EVX allerdings kann mit der suggerierten Abenteuerlust nur schwerlich mithalten.

"South Korea sees no change in US ties regardless of November election, says official","SEOUL – South Korea expects no fundamental shift in relations with the United States even if American voters elect a new president, but hopes to make progress on defence cost-sharing talks and other issues in 2024, a senior presidential official said.
The official, speaking with a small group of journalists on March 11, said South Korea does not devise its policy based on predictions on the US presidential election in November, but that both sides will try to advance efforts to bolster security partnerships before that.
The allies have agreed to launch early talks on sharing the cost of keeping US troops in South Korea, and will accelerate discussions to boost Seoul’s say in operating US extended deterrence, including the American nuclear umbrella, the official said.
“There is an incentive for the Biden administration to work more actively on the issues as it wraps up its first term in 2024,” the official said.
“We share the need to make some achievements, and that’s why both sides have agreed to begin the defence cost-sharing negotiations and complete the work on extended deterrence.”
The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said its delegation visited South Korea in December to discuss the defence cost-sharing deal and would work with Seoul to prepare for talks on the next agreement.
Former president Donald Trump, favoured to be the Republican candidate in the election, had accused South Korea, a key Asian ally, of “free-riding” on US military might, called for stopping what he said were “expensive” war games, and demanded that Seoul pay as much as US$5 billion (S$6.6 billion) a year for the US deployment.
If Trump is elected, South Korea will work with his government, but the alliance will remain unchanged in part because of solid support from the US Congress for greater bilateral cooperation and a trilateral partnership involving Japan, the official said.
“There’s a difference between what you say as a candidate and what you actually do as a responsible head of state who carries out global policies,” the official said.

South Korea criticizes senior doctors for threatening to resign to support their juniors' walkouts,"Doctors stage a rally against the government's medical policy in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, March. 3, 2024. South Korea's government expressed deep regret over the news that some senior doctors could join the protracted walkouts by thousands of junior doctors, saying Tuesday, March 12, the people wont understand another collective action that threatens the lives of patients.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)
SEOUL – South Korea's government criticized senior doctors at a major hospital Tuesday for threatening to resign in support of the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations.
About 12,000 junior doctors in South Korea have been off the job for a month to protest a government plan to sharply increase medical school admissions. Officials say the plan is meant to add more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging society, but doctors say universities can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in the number of students, and that would eventually hurt the quality of South Korea’s medical services.

The government began steps a week ago to suspend the licenses of the striking doctors, after they missed a government-set Feb. 29 deadline for their return.
The walkouts now threaten to enter a critical phase as senior doctors at the Seoul National University Hospital and its affiliated hospitals decided Monday to resign en mass if the government doesn’t come up with measures that can address the dispute by early next week. Senior doctors at other major university hospitals could take similar steps.
“If the government doesn’t take steps toward sincere, reasonable measures to resolve the issue, we decided to submit resignations, starting from March 18,” Bang JaeSeung, leader of the Seoul hospital's emergency committee, told reporters Monday.
But the committee's decision doesn't make participation mandatory, so it's unclear how many doctors could turn in resignations. There are a total of about 1,480 medical professors at the Seoul National University Hospital and its three affiliated hospitals, most of whom concurrently work as doctors there.
Most doctors who submit resignations will likely continue to work to prevent a medical crisis, unless hospital authorities accept their resignations immediately, emergency committee officials said. But by law, they said the doctors' resignations will be automatically processed a month after their submissions.
Last week, the University of Ulsan College of Medicine in the southeast also decided to let its senior doctors submit resignations on a voluntary basis, according to Kim Mi-na, head of the university's emergency committee.
In a briefing Tuesday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo called the Seoul National University Hospital doctor’s decision “very regrettable.” He said they should work with the government to persuade the junior doctors to return to work.
“The people would find it difficult to understand another collective resignation that would put the lives of patients at risk,” Park said.
He said that Health Minister Cho KyooHong met some of the striking junior doctors on Monday, but he refused to provide details of the meeting. There were no immediate reports of a breakthrough.
It was the first meeting between the government and the strikers since authorities began taking a series of administrative steps on March 4 to suspend the strikers' licenses. The steps include dispatching officials to confirm the absences of the strikers, sending notices about the planned suspensions, and giving them opportunities to respond before the license suspensions take effect.
Officials have said the striking doctors would face minimum three-month license suspensions and prosecutions. No suspensions have been reported completed yet.
The striking junior doctors represent only about 6.5% of the country’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals like the Seoul National University Hospital, they account for about 30%-40% of the total doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training. Their walkouts have subsequently caused numerous canceled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals and burdened South Korea’s medical service.
In early February, South Korea's government said it would increase the country's medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say South Korea's doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world, and that more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatment due to increased competition.
The doctors' protests have failed to win public support. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.

South Korea doctors’ strike: government moves to suspend thousands of medical licences,"South Korea’s government has started taking steps to suspend the medical licences of thousands of striking doctors, as concern grows that the month-long dispute is affecting frontline health care services.
The walkout by almost 12,000 doctors from 100 teaching hospitals has led to surgery cancellations, longer waiting times and delays in treatment, including for patients seeking emergency care, according to media reports.
The health ministry said it had put in motion procedures that could see 4,900 of the striking doctors lose their licences if they continue to defy orders to return to work.
The ministry also said it had sent administrative notifications, following up on warnings that strikers faced a three-month suspension – a punishment that could delay their ability to qualify as specialists for at least a year.
The increasingly acrimonious dispute began as a protest against government plans to dramatically raise the number of trainee doctors to address shortages in rural areas and greater demand on services caused by South Korea’s rapidly ageing population.
But the 11,994 striking doctors, who make up 93% of the trainee workforce, claim the recruitment of 2,000 additional students a year from 2025 will compromise the quality of services. Instead, they have called for improvements to pay and conditions.
This week the health ministry said it would assign 20 military surgeons and 138 public health doctors to boost staff numbers at selected hospitals, but denied that the country’s health services had descended into chaos.
Chun Byung-wang, director of the ministry’s health and medical policy division, suggested that doctors who return will avoid punishment. “The government will take into account the circumstance and protect trainee doctors if they return to work before the administrative measure is complete,” Chun said.
He added: “The government will not give up on dialogue. The door is always open. The government will respect and listen to opinions of the medical community as a companion for the medical reforms.”
In an attempt to resolve the dispute, the government last week announced measures to improve pay and conditions for trainee medics, as well as a review of continuous 36-hour shifts – a key grievance among junior medics. But the concessions have failed to placate doctors.
Demands are growing for the two sides to negotiate.
“Doctors and the government are not in a boxing ring,” the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial. “People’s patience is wearing thin … the exit from this quagmire must be found through dialogue between the two sides.”
Critics of the recruitment plan have accused the country’s conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, of using the medical reforms to boost his People Power party’s prospects at next month’s national assembly elections.
A poll published last week by the Yonhap news agency found 84% of respondents supported hiring more doctors, and 43% said striking physicians should receive severe punishments.",2024-03-12T05:06:24Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
East Asia’s baby bonuses aren’t solving falling birth rates,"Governments across Asia—in Singapore and Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul—are facing a crisis: plummeting birth rates.
For several decades now, people in East Asian economies have had fewer and fewer children. Last year, South Korea beat its own record for having the world’s lowest birth rate, reporting 0.72 births per woman for 2023, down from 0.78 in 2022. Singapore reported 0.97 births per woman, the first time the rate has fallen below one. Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, with a median age of 49.5. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China are all reporting falling birth rates as well.
All of these economies have fertility rates far below 2.1, the “replacement rate” which allows for a stable population. They haven’t reported a rate above 2.1 for years, if not decades.
A low birth rate leads to a shrinking population, and a smaller workforce to produce the goods and services that lead to economic growth. Slower economic activity results in drops in fiscal revenue, giving fewer resources to a government that now needs to provide welfare for a growing elderly population.
Academics often point to the cost of childcare, poor work-life balance, a lack of support for new parents (particularly mothers), and the stresses of modern society as reasons for falling birth rates. “In all the cosmopolitan cities, the fertility rate tends to be much lower because [people have] a lot of choices. The higher the development, [the] more urbanized, the more education that women get, the smaller the family size,” Paul Cheung, director of the Asia Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, says.
Faced with this looming crisis, Asian governments have turned to a straightforward solution: Give prospective parents money if they have kids. The connection is simple to understand. If a major barrier to having children is the cost of childcare, then alleviating that cost with extra cash should change someone’s economic calculus.
Except it hasn’t worked. Even Singapore, which Cheung suggests had a “way more generous [policy] than all the Asian countries,” has not succeeded in arresting the decline in fertility.
“Low birth rates are a reflection of big institutional, cultural, structural problems,” said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor of social science and public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “Throwing a bit of money at it is not going to fix it.”
What are governments currently doing to stop falling birth rates?
Cheung, before his stint as an academic, was the director of Singapore’s population planning unit between 1987 and 1994. He helped start Singapore’s pronatalist policy, offering a relatively more generous set of incentives to encourage more births. The government even organized events to help single Singaporeans to meet.
Singapore’s government officially inaugurated its baby bonus scheme in 2001. The most current payout is 11,000 Singapore dollars ($8,263) for each first and second child and 13,000 Singapore dollars ($9,766) each for the third and subsequent child.
Other governments are also trying to dole out incentives. Japan increased its lump-sum childbirth benefit to 500,000 yen ($3,400) in April last year. Starting this October, the government will also offer 15,000 yen ($102) a month to households after the birth of a first and second child until the age of 2, and then continue providing 10,000 yen ($68) till high school. The government will offer more money to families with more than two children.
South Korea has increased its incentives, too. The government gives 2 million Korean won ($1,519) to parents when a baby is born, which increases to 3 million won ($2,279) for the second child. Parents will also get an allowance of up to 18 million won ($13,674) in total for the first two years of the child’s life.
Hong Kong, on the other hand, is offering a one-off cash allowance of HKD 20,000 ($2,557).
Singapore’s birth rate is declining at a slower pace than that of other Asian economies, only falling below 1.0 last year. (By comparison, Hong Kong’s fertility rate first fell below 1.0 in 2001, and hovered around that level before falling back below 1.0 again in 2020). Singapore’s population is still stable, but that may be the result of the country’s more liberal immigration policies, compared with Japan and South Korea.
All these measures seem to do is “delay the population decline a little into the future,” Cheung says.
‘I feel sorry for the government’
The scary thought for demographers may now be that there’s no easy fix for falling fertility. Even Nordic countries, whose more generous pro-child policies were credited with keeping birth rates relatively high, have seen fertility collapse after the COVID pandemic.
“The strange thing with fertility is nobody really knows what’s going on,” Anna Rotkirch, a research director at Family Federation of Finland’s Population Research Institute, told the Financial Times earlier this year. The demographer, who advised former prime minister Sanna Marin on population policy, now thinks fertility decline is “not primarily driven by economics or family policies. It’s something cultural, psychological, biological, cognitive.”
Research from Singapore implies that a drop in fertility could be the result of something more fundamental in how people live in modern society. Tan Poh Lin, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore, found rates of sexual intercourse among married heterosexual couples in Singapore—a “high-stress” society—were lower than the ideal frequency to conceive, generally considered to be five or six times every 30 days. There were “strong negative effects of both stress and fatigue, especially during weekdays,” she writes. Other surveys in Japan and South Korea report similar findings.
But if monetary incentives or better social welfare programs and work-life balance, as in northern European countries, are not getting birth rates to what they should be, then what can Asian economies do to raise them?
“I feel sorry for the government because it’s the only organization or institution doing anything,” Gietel-Basten said. “In reality, everyone has to take responsibility for this. Companies have to change their attitude and recognize children are a social good, and that parents should be supported and not penalized,” he says. “But that costs money.”
Some companies in Asia have made high-profile offers to support employees having children. In February, a South Korean construction firm, the Booyoung Group, offered a bonus worth 100 million won ($76,000) to encourage female employees to have children. China’s Trip.com Group also offered some employees a 10,000 yuan ($1,391) annual bonus for households for every child under the age of five.
But there’s no quick solution, says Gietel-Basten. Instead, he suggests that governments focus on other economic well-being issues—like youth unemployment, job security, and a sense that work is being valued—and hope that indirectly improves fertility rates.
In mainland China, “there’s not even jobs for the young people who are alive now,” he says. “Why do you want to have more children?”",2024-03-12T04:00:00Z,https://fortune.com,Fortune
South Korea's land minister bearish on property as population ages,"South Korea won't see a repeat of the sharp home price gains it did in the past as its population rapidly ages and economy slows, the country's land minister said, vowing to promote public rental accommodation to improve access to housing.
""The population is ageing and the economy is growing by just 2% to 3% each year. There is no way house prices will rise as they did in the past,"" Park Sang-woo, minister of land, infrastructure and transport, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday. ""In the past, the economy grew by 7% to 10% every year, and there were two or three kids in each family. There will never be a 'deja-vu' of that for this generation.""
South Korea's median house prices hit a peak in June 2021 after rising 45% over five years, according to Korea Real Estate Board data. It has since fallen 19% following an aggressive interest rate cycle by the central bank. Still, South Koreans cite high housing costs as the biggest reason behind nose-diving births and marriages. The country's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, hit a fresh record low in 2023.
According to the ministry's annual survey, house prices in 2022 were 6.3 times higher than households' annual income, easing slightly from 6.7 in 2021. In the capital Seoul, however, the price-to-income ratio was 15.2, up from 14.1 a year earlier. The government is working to provide a more affordable housing.
This year, it has rolled out cheap mortgages for newly weds who plan to have a baby. To restore work-life-balance in the wider Seoul area where 45% of population live, the government plans a high-speed underground rail network to connect less expensive housing markets in outskirts of Seoul to jobs in the city's centre. At the same time, the government will provide a greater range of long-term public rental homes through the corporate sector by easing regulations.
It will also help young people invest in assets other than real estate, he said. With real estate demand still weak, Park said he shared the views of financial authorities that unprofitable property projects needed to be restructured.
Last December, Taeyoung Engineering & Construction, a mid-sized South Korean builder, rescheduled its debt, fanning concerns about debt repayment troubles in the sector. ""The structure of real estate project financing, which had worked just fine, is now being shaken by slowing demand and rising input costs,"" Park said. ""We are making various efforts to stop that.""

US Intel Sounds Alarm on North Korea's Use of Chemical Weapons,"A new U.S. intelligence report published on Monday raised alarms about North Korea's deployment of chemical weapons, among other threats posed by the hermit kingdom.
The report, an annual worldwide threat assessment from the U.S. intelligence community, was compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. In it were discussed the recent actions and movements of nations antagonistic to the U.S., such as China and Russia, and the state of certain classifications of attack, including nuclear strikes and cyber attacks.
Amongst the information contained in the report was a breakdown of North Korea, the intensely isolated and authoritarian East Asian nation known for its frequent threats against South Korea and the U.S. At one point, the report noted North Korea for its use of chemical weapons while discussing the ways in which they are used outside of ""state-on-state military operations"" and might develop in the future.
""The use of chemical weapons, particularly in situations other than state-on-state military operations, could increase in the near future,"" the report explained. ""During the past decade, state and non-state actors have used chemical warfare agents in a range of scenarios, including the Syrian military's use of chlorine and sarin against opposition groups and civilians, and North Korea's and Russia's use of chemical agents in targeted killings. More state actors could use chemicals in operations against dissidents, defectors, and other perceived enemies of the state; protestors under the guise of quelling domestic unrest; or against their own civilian or refugee populations.""

Newsweek reached out to foreign defense experts via email for further insight on Monday evening. Any responses received will be added to this story in a later update.
Notably, North Korea has been accused of orchestrating the plot that saw Kim Jong-nam, the older brother of leader Kim Jong-un, assassinated using a chemical weapon, VX nerve toxins, which were smeared on his face by two unwitting women at an airport in Malaysia.
Elsewhere, the report said that North Korea and Kim will continue to seek partnerships with key foreign allies as it pursues economic stability, security, and global acceptance as a nuclear power, all of which it said have been hampered by ""nearly two decades of severe UN sanctions and its self-imposed COVID-19 lockdown.""
""Today, it is pursuing stronger ties with China and Russia with the goal of increasing financial gains, diplomatic support, and defense cooperation,"" the report explained. ""Kim almost certainly has no intentions of negotiating away his nuclear program, which he perceives to be a guarantor of regime security and national pride. In addition, Kim probably hopes that he can use his bourgeoning defense ties with Russia to pursue his goal of achieving international acceptance as a nuclear power.""
As part of this goal, the report noted that North Korea has been providing munitions to Russia for use in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
As of January 2023, North Korea was estimated to have around 30 nuclear warheads, with the materials on hand for the creation of 50-70 more, according to the Arms Control Association.",2024-03-11T22:40:33Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek

"South Korea initiates process to suspend licenses of 4,900 striking doctors","The walkout began on February 20 and aimed to increase the number of doctors to address shortages.
The Health Ministry issued administrative notifications to thousands of trainee doctors.
Military doctors will commence working in civilian hospitals starting from Wednesday this week.

On Monday, South Korea announced that it had initiated procedures to suspend the medical licenses of 4,900 junior doctors who resigned and ceased working to protest government medical training reforms, resulting in healthcare chaos. The walkout, which began on February 20, revolves around government plans to significantly increase the number of doctors. The government asserts that this increase is crucial to address shortages and South Korea’s rapidly aging population, while the medics contend that it will deteriorate service quality.
At the last count, nearly 12,000 junior doctors, constituting 93 percent of the trainee workforce, were absent from their hospitals, despite government orders to return to work and threats of legal action. This compelled Seoul to deploy military medics and allocate millions of dollars from state reserves to assist.
On Monday, the Health Ministry announced that it had issued administrative notifications — the initial step towards suspending the medical licenses of the doctors — to thousands of trainee doctors who defied specific orders to return to their hospitals.
“As of March 8 (notifications) have been sent to more than 4,900 trainee doctors,” Chun Byung-wang, director of the health and medical policy division at the health ministry, told reporters.
The government had previously cautioned striking doctors that they would face a three-month suspension of their licenses, a penalty that, according to the government, would postpone their ability to qualify as specialists by at least a year.
Chun urged the striking medics to return to their patients.

“The government will take into account the circumstance and protect trainee doctors if they return to work before the administrative measure is complete,” he said, indicating doctors who come back to work now could avoid the punishment.
“The government will not give up dialogue. The door for dialogue is always open … The government will respect and listen to the opinions of the medical community as a companion for the medical reforms,” he added.
Last week, the government unveiled new measures aimed at enhancing pay and conditions for trainee medics, along with initiating a review of the continuous 36-hour work period, which junior doctors strongly criticize.
The strikes have resulted in the cancellation of surgeries, extended wait times, and postponed treatments at major hospitals.
Seoul has activated military doctors and allocated millions of dollars from state reserves to alleviate service deficiencies but has refuted claims of a full-blown healthcare crisis.
Chun announced that military doctors would commence working in civilian hospitals starting from Wednesday this week.

Under South Korean law, doctors face restrictions on striking, and the health ministry has requested police to investigate individuals linked to the work stoppage.
The government aims to increase medical school admissions by 2,000 students annually from next year to tackle what it deems one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations.
Doctors express concerns that the reform will degrade the quality of service and medical education, but proponents accuse medics of attempting to protect their salaries and social status.

""You know, internally here, inside the bubble, you hear Republicans say, you know, we need to get a result,"" Johnson complained. ""You know, we need to effectively govern. To me, that's almost code words for we've got to do Democrat-lite.""

Johnson said he preferred a version of conservatism that believed ""we have to stop this madness.""
""So there's a fair amount of stopping that's being required here, and I think we'd be far better off if we never passed another piece of legislation,"" he remarked. ""Obviously, you've got to fund the government, but we need to fund it at a far lower level.""
The Senate, however, passed the temporary funding measure, and President Joe Biden signed it into law.
Johnson has introduced numerous pieces of legislation during his time in the Senate.

South Korea deploys military and other doctors to strike-hit hospitals,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea planned to start deploying military physicians and doctors from public health centers to strike-hit hospitals on Monday to help care for patients affected by the walkout of nearly 12,000 trainee doctors from 100 hospitals over government reform plans.
Twenty military surgeons along with 138 public health doctors will be assigned to 20 hospitals for four weeks, Health Minister Cho Kyoo-hong said at a meeting on Sunday.
The number of military physicians called on to help so far was only a small fraction of the roughly 2,400 military doctors, according to a defense ministry briefing.
The government has denied the walkout, which started on Feb. 20, has caused a full-blown health crisis, but some hospitals have had to turn away patients and delay medical procedures.
As of Friday morning, nearly 12,000 protesting doctors at 100 hospitals had left their posts in a dispute over a government plan to increase medical school admissions, health ministry data showed, defying pressure from the authorities to return to work.
South Korean officials have been trying to coax the doctors to return to work by warning them that their medical licenses could be suspended but so far appear to have had little success with the tactic.
The health ministry said notices had been sent to more than 4,900 doctors as of Friday to instruct them that the authorities could start suspending licenses if they did not explain their action.
Doctors who returned to work before the administrative measure to suspend licenses was complete would be “given leniency,” Cho told KBS Radio on Monday.
The government has the power to order doctors back to work if it deems there is a serious risk to lives and public health.
The government has said the plan to increase annual medical school admissions by 2,000 starting from 2025 is vital to remedy a shortage of doctors in one of the world’s fastest-aging societies.
The striking doctors argue that simply adding medical students will not address pay and work conditions and could possibly exacerbate the problems.
Critics of the policy also accuse President Yoon Suk Yeol of picking a fight over medical reforms to benefit his party ahead of parliamentary elections in April.
A survey published last week by the Yonhap news agency found that 84% of respondents supported adding more doctors, while 43% said striking physicians should be sternly punished.",2024-03-11T09:20:29Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News

Der neue Titel ist dieser zufolge nicht für Jugendliche geeignet.
Die Altersfreigabe könnte eine baldige Ankündigung zum Release-Termin andeuten.
Das Silent Hill 2 Remake ist schon seit 2022 angekündigt, doch viele Informationen hat Konami bisher nicht bekannt gegeben. Das könnte sich allerdings schon bald ändern.
Wie der Gematsu auf X (ehemals Twitter) zeigt, hat der kommende Titel in Korea mittlerweile eine Alterseinstufung erhalten. Dieser zufolge ist das Silten Hill 2 Remake nicht für Jugendliche geeignet.
Enthalten sind übermäßige Gewalt, übermäßig viel Blut, Ausdruck von Gewalt und Ekel. Diese Angaben überraschen wenig, denn immerhin hat Silent Hill eine Altersfreigabe ab 16 erhalten und das originale Silent Hill 2 ist sogar erst ab 18 Jahren verfügbar.

Trump former advisers sound the alarm that he praises despots in private and on the campaign trail,"CNN —
To Donald Trump, Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán is “fantastic,” Chinese leader Xi Jinping is “brilliant,” North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is “an OK guy,” and, most alarmingly, he allegedly said Adolf Hitler “did some good things,” a worldview that would reverse decades-old US foreign policy in a second term should he win November’s presidential election, multiple former senior advisers told CNN.
“He thought Putin was an OK guy and Kim was an OK guy — that we had pushed North Korea into a corner,” retired Gen. John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff, told me. “To him, it was like we were goading these guys. ‘If we didn’t have NATO, then Putin wouldn’t be doing these things.’”
Trump’s lavish praise for Hungarian Prime Minister Orbán while hosting him at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, just days after all but sealing the Republican nomination on Super Tuesday, shows it’s a worldview he’s doubling down on.
""The Return of Great Powers"" by CNN's Jim Sciutto. From Penguin Random House
“There’s nobody that’s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orbán,” Trump said, adding, “He’s the boss and he’s a great leader, fantastic leader. In Europe and around the world, they respect him.”
The former president’s admiration for autocrats has been reported on before, but in comments by Trump recounted to me for my new book, “The Return of Great Powers,” out Tuesday, Kelly and others who served under Trump give new insight into why they warn that a man who consistently praises autocratic leaders opposed to US interests is ill-suited to lead the country in the Great Power clashes that could be coming, telling me they believe that the root of his admiration for these figures is that he envies their power.
“He views himself as a big guy,” John Bolton, who served as national security adviser under Trump, told me. “He likes dealing with other big guys, and big guys like Erdogan in Turkey get to put people in jail and you don’t have to ask anybody’s permission. He kind of likes that.”
“He’s not a tough guy by any means, but in fact quite the opposite,” Kelly said. “But that’s how he envisions himself.”
Alleged praise for Hitler
Trump allegedly reserved some of his most unnerving praise for Hitler, who led Nazi Germany during World War II.
“He said, ‘Well, but Hitler did some good things.’ I said, ‘Well, what?’ And he said, ‘Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.’ But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said, ‘Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing,’” Kelly recounted. “I mean, Mussolini was a great guy in comparison.”
“It’s pretty hard to believe he missed the Holocaust, though, and pretty hard to understand how he missed the 400,000 American GIs that were killed in the European theater,” Kelly told me. “But I think it’s more, again, the tough guy thing.”
Trump’s admiration for Hitler went further than the German leader’s economic policies, according to Kelly. Trump also expressed admiration for Hitler’s hold on senior Nazi officers. Trump lamented that Hitler, as Kelly recounted, maintained his senior staff’s “loyalty,” while Trump himself often did not.
“He would ask about the loyalty issues and about how, when I pointed out to him the German generals as a group were not loyal to him, and in fact tried to assassinate him a few times, and he didn’t know that,” Kelly recalled. “He truly believed, when he brought us generals in, that we would be loyal — that we would do anything he wanted us to do,” Kelly told me.
When asked to respond to the allegations from the former Trump administration officials, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not comment on the substance of what they told me but stated, “John Kelly and John Bolton have completely beclowned themselves and are suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. They need to seek professional help because their hatred is consuming their empty lives.”
In 2021, a spokeswoman for Trump denied allegations that the former president had praised Hitler.
White House spokesperson Andrew Bates responded to Trump’s alleged praise for Hitler in a statement on Tuesday, saying that Biden has called the Nazi leader a “demonic figure.”
“No American should ever praise the genocidal monster who committed the Holocaust. Just like it is incumbent on all leaders not to associate with Neo Nazis and Holocaust deniers. Hundreds of thousands of American service members – heroes, not ‘suckers’ or ‘losers’ – gave their lives to defeat that evil. Admiring Hitler is an insult to their memory. President Biden is committed to bringing all Americans together based on our shared values,” Bates said.
‘Shocked that he didn’t have dictatorial-type powers’
Trump’s former advisers say he most consistently lavished praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bolton recalled a comment from Trump during the 2018 NATO summit. Following sometimes tense encounters with NATO leaders, Trump said his meeting with Putin, the leader of America’s great power adversary, “may be the easiest of them all. Who would think?”
“He says to the press as he goes out to the helicopter, ‘I think the easiest meeting might be with Vladimir Putin. Who would ever think that?’” recalled Bolton. “There’s an answer to that question. Only one person. You. You are the only person who would think that. The shrinks can make of that what they will, but I think it was ‘I’m a big guy. They’re big guys. I wish I could act like they do.’”
“My theory on why he likes the dictators so much is that’s who he is,” Kelly said. “Every incoming president is shocked that they actually have so little power without going to the Congress, which is a good thing. It’s Civics 101, separation of powers, three equal branches of government. But in his case, he was shocked that he didn’t have dictatorial-type powers to send US forces places or to move money around within the budget. And he looked at Putin and Xi and that nutcase in North Korea as people who were like him in terms of being a tough guy.”

“Trump believed in the power of his personal charisma and diplomacy,” recalled Matthew Pottinger, his deputy national security adviser, who was deeply involved in Trump’s meetings with North Korean leader Kim and Chinese President Xi. “He had almost unlimited faith in it. That was as true with Kim as it was with Xi — but also with allies too.”
Trump has continued to praise authoritarians in his 2024 presidential campaign.
At a town hall organized by Fox News in July 2023, Trump said, “Think of President Xi: central casting, brilliant guy. When I say he’s brilliant, everyone says, ‘Oh, that’s terrible.’ He runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist: smart, brilliant, everything perfect. There is nobody in Hollywood like this guy.”
In an interview with Fox that same month, Trump lavished praise on Putin as well, describing him as smarter than President Joe Biden. “These are smart people, including Macron of France. I could go through the whole list of people, including Putin .… These people are sharp, tough, and generally vicious,” Trump said. “They’re vicious, and they’re at the top of their game. We have a man that has no clue what’s happening. It’s the most dangerous time in the history of our country.”

Trump’s affinity for authoritarians represents a defining issue for the US as the 2024 election approaches. Several of his own former advisers believe, in a second term, he would bring a fundamental shift in the US’ vision of itself and its role in the world, including potentially pulling the US out of NATO and reducing the US’ commitment to other defense alliances.
“NATO would be in real jeopardy,” Bolton told me. “I think he would try to get out.”
Many veterans of the Trump administration have a similar warning for Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion. “US support for Ukraine would end,” said a senior US official who served under Trump and Biden.
“The point is, he saw absolutely no point in NATO,” Kelly said. “He was just dead set against having troops in South Korea, again, a deterrent force, or having troops in Japan, a deterrent force.”",2024-03-11T08:00:37Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network

An Irish ‘chancer’ abroad: I swapped TV stardom in Seoul to become a doctor,"Greystones man Neil Smith: 'I want to share my story with as many people as possible back home who are thinking about a career in medicine.'
At the age of 25, armed with a passion for musical adventure, a very heavy Fender bass guitar and not enough clothes for the bitter east Asian winter, I boarded a plane for South Korea.
A chancer from Greystones who barely scraped an electrical engineering degree at DIT, I wanted to escape the recession for a year or two and be the next Joe Strummer. Little did I know, this decision would shape the next 11 years of my life where I had a belter of a time as an indie musician, music teacher and a Korean-speaking reality TV celebrity.
With the unwavering support of my wife, our journey took a turn again, leading us to Varna, Bulgaria, where I embarked on the pursuit of a medical education.
Stepping foot in Seoul for the first time felt like landing on the set of Blade Runner. The city pulsated with neon-lit, 24/7 nightlife, packed subway carriages and streets adorned with an array of bustling, steamy restaurants – a stark contrast to Dublin in 2010.

Although many find Seoul overwhelming, it was a symphony that resonated with me. I instantly immersed myself in the vibrant indie music scene as a bass player, embracing the unique and energetic rhythm of the city.
Having entered the country on an English as a second language teaching visa, my foray into education took a back seat when opportunities on TV and grand stages presented themselves.
[ Why many Irish people chose Vancouver to go for a holiday or a longer stay ]
Auditioning successfully, I became a part of renowned Korean bands, playing rock festivals where I performed in front of tens of thousands, including opening for iconic touring bands such as Foo Fighters, Kasabian and Motörhead. We toured Japan, China and Taiwan. Working in a daily environment of Korean bandmates and managers, I seized the opportunity to learn to speak Korean.
Seeking independence and greater artistic control, I formed my own four-piece indie band, The Scarlet Pillows, as lead singer. We caught the attention of reality TV producers and I was cast on TV and Netflix shows that had millions of viewers. People began stopping me in the street asking me for photos and I was getting mobbed during nights out with friends. I even did an interview live on the Dave Fanning show on RTÉ 2FM and he played one of my songs. However, amid all of this fortune, an insistent tap on my shoulder began to command more of my attention, gradually turning my head in a different direction.
The weather is class, the beer is cheap, rent is extremely low and the beach is a dream
For some time, perhaps since my early 30s, I had begun daydreaming of a completely different path, however. Having got the very best out of my youth, I gradually developed a desire to assist those facing obstacles that hinder them from enjoying similar experiences. I felt that becoming a doctor was the best way to achieve this.
Registering as a mature student in Ireland wasn’t possible due to my extended residence outside the EU. This limitation led me to discover Bulgarian universities offering medical programmes in English. After careful consideration, we chose Varna, an unspoiled gem of a warm, sunny beach town on the Black Sea.
I persuaded my Korean wife not only to support my pursuit of a medical degree at the age of 37, but also to accompany me to eastern Europe. We got married not long before leaving Korea and her support has been relentless. I wouldn’t have been able to attempt this without her and the steadfast backing from both our families.
As I approach the end of my third year at Medical University Varna, I’m absolutely loving the course and being in a hospitable environment. Bulgaria, being an EU country with a majority of young people proficient in English, offers a smoother transition for Irish individuals compared with Korea.
[ Co Leitrim to Birmingham: Get the boat, get the start, get on ]
Thanks to the budget airlines, getting home for visits is much easier too. Many Irish medical students study in Poland and Hungary, but honestly, they’re missing out on the craic over here. The weather is class, the beer is cheap, rent is extremely low and the beach is a dream.
Although the entry requirements are more lenient than medical universities back home, it doesn’t mean that the course is any easier. It’s very intense and I’m working flat out to get past each exam session. As the bureaucracy of applying to the university can be difficult to get around, my wife and I started a company, Irish Doctors Bulgaria, to assist fellow Irish students with their applications.
I want to share my story with as many people as possible back home who are thinking about a career in medicine. With strong ambition it’s definitely possible.

This SUV is the most luxurious SsangYong ever,"KG Mobility, formerly (and still, in Australia) known as SsangYong, has revealed a new flagship version of its Rexton SUV.
Previewed by the Rexton Limousine concept at last year’s Seoul motor show, the Rexton Summit ditches the second- and third-row benches of the regular SUV.
In their place are two Nappa leather-upholstered, power-adjustable second-row seats, which can recline by 140 degrees and slide by 16.8cm.

These are separated by a console with a refrigerator, touchscreen and wireless phone charger, while ahead of the chairs are pair of 14-inch screens that allow passengers to watch streaming services like Netflix.
The company also says the Rexton Summit uses a “super surround system”, though the translated spec sheet only makes note of a six-speaker system.
The interior is offered in either Snow Beige or black.
The Korean brand also says the Rexton Summit has a “newly designed acceleration logic and a power booster to enable smooth yet explosive acceleration”, as well as retuned suspension and 20-inch “low-noise” all-terrain tyres.

We’ve contacted SsangYong Australia to confirm if there are any plans to bring this model to Australia.
The Rexton recently received an update, bringing a new dashboard design with a larger, free-standing 12.3-inch touchscreen display and touch-capacitive climate control switchgear.
The company says the Rexton has new lower body mounts to give it a “more rounded feel from secondary ride inputs”.
Australian-market models, however, continue to miss out on features like adaptive cruise control which are offered in Korea.

Dodgers’ Tyler Glasnow set to face Padres’ Yu Darvish to open MLB season in South Korea,"The Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres on Monday announced their starting pitchers for the teams’ widely anticipated season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea. Tyler Glasnow and Yu Darvish will take the mound March 20 at Gocheok Sky Dome, with Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Joe Musgrove scheduled to follow on March 21. The two games will be the first MLB regular-season contests played in South Korea.
The first game of the series will mark the Dodgers debuts of both Glasnow and Shohei Ohtani, two of the three blockbuster acquisitions from L.A.’s historic offseason. The third newcomer, Yamamoto, will get his introduction in the second game.
For Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim, the first Asian-born middle infielder to win a Gold Glove Award, the series will mark his homecoming inside his former home ballpark in the Korea Baseball Organization. Darvish will throw the first pitch of this major-league season a year after winning the 2023 World Baseball Classic with Ohtani, Yamamoto and new Padres teammate Yuki Matsui.
Here are your starting pitcher matchups for next week's #SeoulSeries! 💪 pic.twitter.com/hPGT1o9luP — MLB (@MLB) March 11, 2024
Significance for Dodgers
The Dodgers acquired Glasnow over the winter and promptly extended him to a nine-figure deal because they believe the 30-year-old’s elite stuff can help win them games in October. Now, he’s going to be among the faces at the front of one of the most anticipated season openers in the franchise’s history. If not for the club’s other billion-dollar signings of Shohei Ohtani and Yamamoto, Glasnow would very well be the winter’s headliner, with the club messaging strongly this spring that the best is yet to come for the tall right-hander.

“Just to sign (an extension) here, that all being a reality feels crazy,” Glasnow said. “Then when they told me I was the Opening Day starter, I definitely felt a lot of pride and excitement.”
Ohtani figures to be part of the club’s future rotation after inking a 10-year, $700 million deal this winter, but will be restricted to designated hitter duty this summer after undergoing elbow ligament reconstruction surgery in September; his rehab as a hitter this spring quickly turned a Dodgers debut in Seoul into a near-certainty, and the two-time AL MVP will be sandwiched between a pair of fellow former MVPs (Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman) in the No. 2 spot in the batting order as they take on Ohtani’s Samurai Japan teammate, Darvish, in the opening game.
Glasnow’s selection leaves Yamamoto, given the biggest contract ever for a pitcher before so much as appearing in a big league game, to start the second game. The Japanese right-hander’s Major League Baseball debut will come under the spotlight of an international stage, kicking off a 12-year, $325 million deal for a club that has been fascinated by him for years.
“We feel both guys are top-end guys,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said, noting the decision was influenced in part due to wanting to ensure Yamamoto get extra days of rest. — Fabian Ardaya, Dodgers staff writer
Significance for Padres
With two established big-league starters on their roster, the Padres always were going to start Darvish and Musgrove in Seoul. The only question was in what order.
Padres manager Mike Shildt wound up informing Darvish last week that he would get first honors. For Darvish, it will be his third Opening Day start in four seasons with San Diego. It will be a chance to further distance himself from a year ago, when he barely pitched in the World Baseball Classic and spring training, then endured a bumpy start to his 2023 campaign.

And, a short flight away from their native Japan, it will be an opportunity for Darvish to face WBC teammate Ohtani in his first official Dodgers plate appearance.
“I think it’s pretty special for our game,” Shildt said. “I think it’s pretty special for international baseball, especially for Major League Baseball. I think it says a lot about where the game has grown to, where the game is going. And look, we don’t plan for these things to happen, but they tend to work out, and I think it’s really a fantastic thing for Major League Baseball, and the Japan fan base is going to be pretty excited about it, I’m sure.”
The upcoming, irregular schedule means the Padres can afford to be creative with their pitching plans. Michael King, a less-than-fully-established starter who evaluators believe could emerge as San Diego’s best pitcher, will be available out of the bullpen in Seoul.
And the Padres could opt to start either Darvish or Musgrove in their domestic opener March 28 at Petco Park. Shildt indicated there is a good chance those honors will go to Musgrove, a San Diego-area native. — Dennis Lin, senior Padres writer

Jesse Lingard helps break record on home debut in South Korea,"FC Seoul star Jesse Lingard helped set a new K-League record this week on his home debut.
Lingard made the shock move to South Korea earlier this year on a free transfer after his contract at Nottingham Forest expired last summer.
3 Lingard was named on the FC Seoul bench on Saturday
The England international signed a two-year deal with FC Seoul and he was called the K-League's biggest ever arrival.
And his popularity with his new fans was proven on Saturday after they broke the K-League record attendance during FC Seoul's 0-0 draw against Incheon.
Lingard's signing prompted huge excitement in South Korea with 51,670 fans packing into the Seoul World Cup Stadium.
That saw the record attendance in the division smashed as supporters flocked to watch the former Manchester United man in action in the Gyeongin derby.
Before a ball had even been kicked, a fan park dubbed 'the Lingard zone' was set up to sell merchandise based on the Englishman.
There were two-hour queues for tickets to the match, as well as separate stands based solely on Lingard-based wares.
However, while there were fans desperate to see the 31-year-old in action, he was named on the bench initially.
It did not take long before the attacking midfielder was on, though, taking Takuya Shigehiro's spot after 30 minutes.

And he was given a standing ovation from the fans inside the stadium as they got to see their man in action.

One flick in particular sparked jubilation from the spectators, showcasing some of the dazzling skills he showed in patches in the Premier League.
Lingard could have won the match for FC Seoul late on, too, when he was presented with a glorious chance in the 83rd minute.
However, when the ball fell to his feet, he scuffed the shot and it went high and wide, though it appeared to hit a bobble.
Speaking after the match, the ex-West Ham loanee said: ""Probably should have won in the end. I had a couple of half-chances.
""Not enough clear chances, but I think we can build on this. I think it's all about mindset and confidence coming into these games.
""In front of a big crowd, first home game - amazing support throughout.

Even Korea is starting to prefer the iPhone over Samsung's Galaxy phones,"For years, Samsung smartphones have been the best-selling devices in South Korea, where the company has been based since 1938. However, the iPhone continues to surge in popularity, showing Samsung that its top spot in its home country may not be as solid as you might think.
Even worse, Apple and the iPhone officially outsold Samsung devices around the globe in 2023, breaking a 12-year streak held by the Korean tech firm as the world's top smartphone seller. So, what's driving this shift in smartphone popularity? Today, we'll explore Apple's edge over Samsung, why the smartphone manufacturer might be slipping, and whether Apple is poised to continue its hot streak.
Samsung vs Apple by the numbers
iPhone sales in Korea are rising, as Apple overtakes Samsung globally
Close
Samsung leading the market share in South Korea feels like a given since the company has been based in the East Asian country for nearly 90 years. Samsung represents 66 percent of the smartphone market share in South Korea, nearly triple that of Apple, which sits at only 29 percent.
Nothing lasts forever, though, and a recent spike in South Korea's iPhone sales could spell doom for Samsung in the long run. A report from the Korea Herald noted that the iPhone 15 lineup's sales — including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max — have increased substantially in the country, jumping 41.9 percent in the first month since its release in October 2023 compared to the iPhone 14.

According to numbers from the International Data Corporation (IDC), Apple is officially the top smartphone seller in the world, surpassing Samsung in 2023 by 8 million units, which is even more troubling for the tech giant. That’s right, while Samsung sold an admittedly impressive 26.6 million units, Apple edged them out with 234.6 million units sold. This now puts Apple at 20.1 percent of the global smartphone market share, while Samsung falls to a close second at 19.4 percent of the market share.
Why is Samsung losing market share?
Apple’s popularity and the expanding Android market
There are plenty of reasons that Samsung could be hemorrhaging users in its home country and beyond. For starters, the Android market is crowded, so it's harder and harder to stay in the fight as competitors get better and better. Between Huawei gaining popularity in China, Google establishing the value of the Pixel lineup every year, and Xiaomi undercutting on price, the competition is nothing if not stiff. That, combined with the fact that its devices are getting a bit boring with every iteration, means that Samsung is no longer the undeniable option for Android users.

On top of that, the barriers to top-dollar smartphones appear to be lessening, with high-end devices now representing 20% of the global smartphone market. That means that the decidedly expensive iPhone is not viewed as the unattainable tech symbol it was previously.
All that to say, Samsung isn’t doing enough to compete with a company that has proven its worth when it comes to marketing, particularly when Apple is making moves to finally catch up to the Android way of life.
Apple’s acquiescence
Will Apple’s adoption of USB-C and RCS messaging help?
One of the main reasons Apple has overtaken Samsung around the globe may be that the iPhone is finally getting some Android features that users have wanted for years. The boom in the iPhone 15 lineup is at least partially due to the installation of the USB-C charging port, which the company was forced to adopt thanks to an EU decision that requires all devices sold in Europe to enact the standard by fall 2024. Apple is also planning to finally include RCS messaging for texting between Android and iPhone, again forced by the EU.

That’s not all, though. In Korea specifically, carriers have helped Apple to add call recording to the iPhone, a feature that has been available on Samsung devices for years. While it may seem innocuous, the ability to record a call has been incredibly popular with Korean users, and it was cited as a primary reason that many citizens decided to make the switch. Lower prices driven by carrier deals also make iPhones more accessible to users.
Yes, Android devices are almost universally ahead of the iPhone when it comes to features. But with innovation becoming harder and harder to come by, Apple continues to catch up in areas that matter to users. And if Samsung can’t keep ahead, there could be a new top dog in South Korea before long.",2024-03-10T12:00:13Z,https://www.androidpolice.com,Android Police
South Korea to finish sending licence suspension notices to doctors in walkout,"SEOUL – South Korea will complete sending out this week its first licence suspension notices to thousands of doctors who have walked off their jobs in protest at a government plan to increase medical school enrolment.
The doctors who receive notices will have to submit their views to the government by March 25, and a failure to do so could ultimately lead to the suspension of their medical licences for several months, Yonhap News agency reported at the weekend, citing government and medical industry sources, and other local media.
About 90 per cent of the country’s 13,000 trainee doctors failed to report to work by the end of a February deadline set by the government, Yonhap said.
The walkout will soon enter its fourth week, with no signs of a quick ending.
Trainee doctors are similar to medical residents and play key roles in emergency care.
President Yoon Suk-yeol has stood by his plan to increase enrolment by 2,000 seats a year at medical schools from the current 3,058.
The government said the change is needed to ease a doctor shortage that is among the most acute in the developed world, and is essential for supporting the medical system in the rapidly ageing country.
Mr Yoon’s government has threatened to revoke the licences of doctors for leading a labour action it says violates medical laws.
The notices are part of the procedure for suspending the licences of thousands of trainee doctors for three months for defying the return-to-work order, a move that could set them back on their career paths and affect employment prospects.
The labour action could widen next week, with academics from the Medical Professors Association of Korea group threatening to resign over the government plan, Yonhap said.
The doctors contend the proposal to increase enrolments would not fix fundamental problems such as a concentration of doctors in urban areas and a lack of specialists in fields seen as risky and lower paying. They want to see changes to the malpractice system that give more protection to physicians.
Polling indicates the public is siding with the government, seeing the reform as a way to cut waiting times for health care.
South Korean doctors rank near the best paid among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in comparison with average wages.
This has led to criticism the labour action may be more about protecting their earning power rather than improving the healthcare system.
Mr Yoon’s approval rating has climbed during the walkout to its highest since July 2023. This could help his conservative People Power Party in April elections as it tries to take control of Parliament from the progressive Democratic Party.

"Padres roster projection 2.0: Manny Machado likely DH in South Korea, clearing path at 3B","PEORIA, Ariz. — It’s about to get weird. The San Diego Padres are scheduled to land, after a roughly 13-hour flight, well past midnight Friday in Seoul, South Korea. On that Sunday, they’ll play the first of two exhibition games (against the South Korean national team and then the LG Twins). The regular season opens March 20 with the first of two games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Then the Padres will fly to San Diego, catch up on rest, host the Seattle Mariners for a pair of exhibitions and — finally, on March 28 — open their domestic regular season against the San Francisco Giants.
The Padres, if they want, could start the same two pitchers March 20-21 and March 28-29. They don’t have to announce their fourth and fifth starters until they return to San Diego. “And we probably won’t,” manager Mike Shildt said. They likely will take their final decisions regarding an initial, 26-man roster down to the wire; the team can bring 31 players to South Korea, and all of those players will be eligible to play in the exhibitions at Gocheok Sky Dome.

With an irregular spring training quickly approaching its conclusion, here is a guess on how things could shake out.
Lineup
1. Fernando Tatis Jr., RF
2. Jake Cronenworth, 1B
3. Xander Bogaerts, 2B
4. Manny Machado, DH
5. Ha-Seong Kim, SS
6. Luis Campusano, C
7. Jurickson Profar, LF
8. Graham Pauley, 3B
9. Jackson Merrill, CF
Machado went 3-for-3 with a double Saturday in his best offensive showing of this Cactus League, and it may not have been a coincidence; the third baseman recently took a break from throwing after experiencing some soreness that is not unusual for someone who underwent significant elbow surgery in the offseason. Machado will restart his throwing program Sunday, Shildt said after Saturday’s game.
“He took a four- or five-day period of just letting things rest (in terms of) the combination of hitting and throwing,” Shildt said. “We just said, you know what? Let’s get the bat going, which … he was able to display today. … Once that gets going, he’ll start throwing again.”
So, as many have predicted, will Machado be the Padres’ designated hitter — not their starting third baseman — on March 20?
“I think that’s probably pretty safe,” Shildt said.
This was always a distinct possibility for Machado coming off right elbow extensor tendon repair. He will ease back, at some point, into regularly playing third base. In the meantime, Pauley has emerged as a strong contender to fill in at third base (and first base) in Machado’s defensive absence. Yes, between Pauley and Merrill — who essentially has been a roster lock for some time — the Padres could start two rookies on Opening Day with limited experience above Single A.

Of course, that wouldn’t be ideal. Team officials still have not ruled out the possibility of a reunion with Tommy Pham (at this point, perhaps after the Seoul Series), but there would have to be more than a little compromise for the two sides to reach an agreement. If they both make the roster, how Merrill and Pauley perform under the bright lights in South Korea could help inform the Padres’ willingness to re-examine the trade market or move closer to Pham’s asking price (or the asking price of other remaining free agents).

Bench
• Kyle Higashioka, C
• Brett Sullivan, C
• José Azocar, OF
• Eguy Rosario, UTIL
The Padres could opt to carry three catchers at the outset. Sullivan, who bats lefty, has some experience at third base and in the outfield (and some recent Cactus League time at first base). He has minor-league options left, as do Azocar and Rosario. Perhaps the Padres, who remain conspicuously thin in the outfield, instead will carry a non-roster invitee such as Óscar Mercado or Tyler Wade, who made an appearance in center field Saturday.
Saturday also saw recent minor-league signee Brad Miller, another lefty hitter, appear at first base. Miller, 34, hit 20 home runs for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2021, but he has only a .606 OPS over the past two seasons. Still, occasional time at first base might be a path onto a roster that could feature more than a little inexperience — if not on March 20, maybe down the road.
“It’s a position he’s comfortable with,” said Shildt, who managed Miller for the St. Louis Cardinals in 2020. “We don’t have a ton of depth there, natural depth, so he provides that as well. He’s a guy who can DH, a guy who can pinch hit. … Obviously (Miller was) late to camp, so we’ll see what it looks like.”
Rotation
• Joe Musgrove, RHP
• Yu Darvish, RHP
• Michael King, RHP
• Jhony Brito, RHP
• Matt Waldron, RHP
Waldron scattered seven hits across 4 1/3 innings of one-run ball Saturday, and the knuckleballer appears to have solidified his case to make the team as a back-end starter or long reliever. Waldron has pitched to a 1.35 ERA this spring, and he leads both the Cactus and Grapefruit leagues with 13 1/3 innings of work. What more could he have done in Arizona to help himself?
“The answer really is effectively nothing,” Shildt said. “I mean, he’s been effective every time he’s been out. … He’s done everything we’ve asked.”

These are only exhibitions, but Waldron has outperformed December acquisition Randy Vásquez, who has options left (and who could serve as a big-league long reliever himself). With Musgrove and Darvish expected to start the two games in Seoul — and with more than a week between that series and domestic Opening Day — King and whoever else is penciled into the rotation might be available out of the bullpen at Gocheok Sky Dome. Whether those pitchers throw in the preceding exhibitions could affect their availability or lack thereof.
Bullpen
• Robert Suarez, RHP
• Yuki Matsui, RHP
• Wandy Peralta, LHP
• Steven Wilson, RHP
• Enyel De Los Santos, RHP
• Tom Cosgrove, LHP
• Woo-Suk Go, RHP
• Pedro Avila, RHP
Matsui seems to be recovering and rehabbing well after being sidelined by back spasms. He will need to continue on his current trajectory; the Padres aren’t ready to commit to his being on the active roster for the season opener.
“I feel good about the possibility,” Shildt said. “I wish I knew, clearly, but he’s trending in a very good place.”
With Matsui expected to face hitters early this week, the Padres on Saturday got scoreless innings from — in order — Stephen Kolek, Steven Wilson, Wandy Peralta and likely closer Robert Suarez.
“I won’t say you’ll mimic Peralta in the eighth every time, but he’s definitely a guy at the back end of the bullpen,” Shildt said. “It’s a look we wanted to see, and we got to see it today. It looked good.”
Avila has a 9.82 ERA this spring, but his lack of options could encourage the Padres to hang on to him, potentially as a long reliever. Avila, who has a 3.11 ERA in 18 career regular-season appearances, cannot be sent to the minors without first being subjected to waivers. But the Padres also must consider what have been strong springs for Jeremiah Estrada and Kolek, a Rule 5 draftee.

Kina bygger krigsskip langt raskere enn USA.,"Kina ruster opp krigsflåten i rekordfart. USA ber om hjelp til å bygge skip raskere.
Kina har allerede verdens største krigsflåte. Den skal bli enda større.

Kortversjonen Kina har verdens største krigsflåte, og den vokser. USAs flåte klarer ikke å holde tempoet oppe. Sammendraget er laget ved hjelp av kunstig intelligens (KI) og kvalitetssikret av Aftenpostens journalister. Kortversjon er kun for abonnenter
USAs marineminister Carlos Del Toro besøkte nylig Japan og Sør-Korea. Budskapet var klinkende klart: USA trenger nye penger, ekspertise og arbeidskraft for å gjenåpne stengte og inaktive amerikanske skipsverft. Det går rett og slett for sent med byggetakten sett i forhold til Kina.
Kinesiske verft har mer enn 200 ganger større kapasitet for skipsbygging enn USA. Det viste en lekkasje fra amerikansk etterretning i fjor høst. Det betyr at overtaket i antall krigsfartøyer bare kommer til å øke i årene fremover.
Har slått alarm
USA hadde tidligere et titall offentlige eide verft for bygging av marinefartøyer. I dag er det bare fire igjen. Noen av de nedlagte verftene brukes nå til andre formål, men kan være mulig å gjenåpne, tror amerikanerne.
Kinas raske oppbygging av krigsflåten har fått den amerikanske regjeringen til å slå alarm: Kineserne har nå verdens største skipsbyggingsindustri i ryggen.
Kampstyrken er ventet å øke fra minst 370 skip og ubåter i dag til mellom 425 og 440 rundt 2030.
Antall er ikke alt
Riktig nok anses den amerikanske flåten enn så lenge for å være teknologisk overlegen. Og antall skip er ikke nødvendigvis det viktigste. I en rapport til den amerikanske kongressen understreker marinen at det er store forskjeller på sammensetningen av Kina og USAs flåtestyrker.
Kina har flere dieseldrevne angrepsubåter, fregatter og korvetter.
USA har flere og bedre hangarskip, atomdrevne ubåter, kryssere og jagere. De er bedre samkjørt og har lang trening i å operere på verdenshavene.
Men Kina er i ferd med å ta igjen forspranget. Og de lærer raskt, selv om satsingen på sjømakt historisk sett er av relativt ny dato.
Nikkei Asia skriver at amerikanske verft, enten de er private eller offentlig eid, sliter med å konkurrere med andre industrier på lønn. Dermed får de ikke tak i nok arbeidskraft.
Den antatt alvorligste flaskehalsen for amerikanerne gjelder ubåter og missiljagere (destroyere).
Hittil er det bygget to atomdrevne ubåter pr. år, men nå er takten nede i 1,2. Også produksjonen av nye guidede missildestroyere går for sakte, ifølge Congressional Research Service.
Men amerikansk lov kan bli en sperre.
Fakta Ordliste Hangarskip. Krigsskip med start- og landingsbane for luftfartøyer. Gjør det mulig å bruke luftmakt over store avstander uten å være avhengig av lokale baser. Omkring ti land i verden opererer med hangarskip. Krysser. Moderne kryssere er generelt de største krigsskipene i en flåte etter hangarskip og amfibieangrepsskip. Kan utføre bl.a. eskortetjeneste og selvstendige angrepsoppgaver. Jager (destroyer). Et hurtiggående krigsskip av middels størrelse bevæpnet med torpedoer, antiubåtvåpen og ofte missiler. Fregatt. Et lite til middelstort, hurtig krigsskip. Moderne fregatter brukes spesielt som eskorte for hangarskip og konvoier, til luftforsvar og i jakt på ubåter. Korvett.

Tid og penger å spare, men loven står i veien
USAs ambassadør i Japan, Rahm Emanuel, fulgte marineministeren på et besøk til storkonsernet Mitsubishis verft i Yokohama.
Emanuel ser for seg at private, japanske verft skal kunne stå for vedlikehold, reparasjoner og overhalinger av amerikanske krigsskip. Det er det tid og penger å spare på fremfor å sende skipene hjem til USA. Og det vil lette trykket på amerikanske verft som dermed kan bygge nye skip i stedet.
Men amerikansk lov står i veien. Det er ikke tillatt å la amerikansk-baserte skip å bli overhalt, reparert eller vedlikeholdt ved verft utenfor USA eller Guam.
Dette er ment å beskytte jobber i USA. I et valgår er det en dårlig idé å skulle endre loven. Men å be om investeringer som vekker til live sovende amerikanske verft, er uproblematisk.",2024-03-09T20:29:22Z,https://www.aftenposten.no,Aftenposten
The North Korean refugees sold to Chinese husbands,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —
Chae-ran sets the plate of sliced oranges and dragon fruit on the floor, a few feet from the pile of bedding where she sleeps.
At 35 years old she is starting over again, alone in a foreign country, without so much as a photograph or letter from her old life – just a sparse room with bare white walls. But it’s home, and the first place she’s had to herself after a life lived in the shadows.
Chae-ran is among a number of women who fled North Korea – only to be trafficked and sexually exploited in China, where a gender imbalance has created a black market for brides.
She managed to stage a second escape nearly two decades later, through Laos and Thailand. But opportunities for others to take the same path have narrowed since the pandemic, experts say – leaving untold numbers of North Korean girls and women trapped in servitude.
CNN is identifying Chae-ran by a pseudonym for the safety of her family back in North Korea – and the son she left behind in China.

Escape and exploitation
Chae-ran made her first escape after finishing high school. She’d been assigned a job at a coal mine, like her father and most people in their village near the Chinese border – but the teenager didn’t want to spend her life doing hard labor, deep underground.
She’d seen other villagers crossing the river that separates North Korea from China to find work and wanted to help support her family. So, one day, without telling her mother, she and a friend left home with the help of a broker – people who plan and facilitate the journey out of North Korea for a fee. She remembers it was early evening in autumn; the sky was still light when she crossed the river.
But upon reaching the other side, she and her friend were put into cars and driven into northwestern China, where they were given a choice, she said: entertain customers at a bar, or marry a Chinese man.
“I wanted to cry but I knew nothing could change even if I did,” she said, speaking in Korean during a conversation with CNN. “I thought I couldn’t work at a bar so that left me only one option, marrying a Chinese man.”
Shortly afterward, Chae-ran says she was separated from her friend, who she never saw again, and introduced to the man who had bought her, a Chinese farmer eight years her senior.
“I didn’t like the man because he was short, but I didn’t want to be sold again so I stayed quiet,” she said.
She was brought to the man’s village, in the mountains of northeastern Hebei province, close to the capital Beijing. “Honestly, they seemed poorer than my family,” she said. “The houses in the village were made from mud and stones, and the windows didn’t have glass but thin paper.”
Since she couldn’t speak Chinese, she couldn’t communicate with the farmer or his family, and felt she couldn’t run away. That was 17 years ago.
Many like Chae-ran leave their isolated home nation hoping to find freedom and opportunity once across the Chinese border, only to be trafficked by the brokers they hired. One 2019 investigation by the London-based Korea Future Initiative (KFI) claimed that tens of thousands of North Korean girls and women were being exploited this way, including some as young as 12.
Men far outnumber women in China, largely due to its former one-child policy and families’ traditional preference for sons. Human traffickers are reportedly attempting to fill that gap by selling North Korean girls and women – some into marriage, while others are enslaved in brothels or made to perform graphic acts on webcams, according to researchers and organizations that help refugees.
Once a victim enters a forced marriage, she is often raped, given no choice but to have children, and compelled into domestic or manual labor, according to the KFI report.
CNN was not able to independently verify claims made in the report. Other reports by the US State Department and rights groups including Human Rights Watch have reached similar conclusions.
Chae-ran said her so-called “husband” didn’t treat her badly, but she was required to obey him, and he presented her as his wife. Within eight weeks of being sold, Chae-ran became pregnant. She said she didn’t want to have a child with him and attempted to induce a miscarriage, but failed and gave birth to a son.
“The baby was so beautiful,” she said. “When I saw my pretty baby, I changed my mind.”
She resigned herself to living in China for the rest of her life.
Living in the shadows
There are few ways out for trafficking victims like Chae-ran.
China considers North Korean refugees to be economic migrants, and forcibly deports them back to North Korea – where, as alleged defectors, they face imprisonment, possible torture or worse, activists say.
That forces refugees to live in the shadows, without legal status or protections, often unable to speak the language and with no way to reach loved ones back home.
Chae-ran and her husband’s family moved to a nearby town a few years later, where she found work washing dishes. Later, when she began learning Chinese, she worked at a supermarket, a tea shop and as a food delivery courier.
During that period, she also met other North Korean refugees in the same situation – with their status public knowledge in the village, she said. CNN is not disclosing the location to protect Chae-ran’s identity.
According to the KFI report, the buying of a North Korean wife is “always known to the local community” but rarely reported to authorities. Some locals argue their village would not survive otherwise, given the skewed gender ratio and China’s falling birthrate.
Some refugees in the town, like Chae-ran, had no identification documents and lived under the radar for fear of arrest and deportation back to North Korea – meaning they are often denied job opportunities, access to health care, and the ability to move freely. But, she said, a few others did have documents that gave them better access to resources.
According to researchers and experts, authorities in some parts of China have begun issuing so-called “residence permits” to North Korean women married to Chinese men, for a “considerable financial price.”
These aren’t official state-issued ID cards, but rather a document used by China’s public security forces for surveillance purposes, according to Kim Jeong Ah, a former North Korean refugee who was trafficked in China, and now heads the organization Rights for Female North Koreans (RFNK).
Speaking at the United Nations in September, Kim described how these residence permits allow North Korean refugees to get jobs and use public transport within the region – but not to travel beyond their local area, or to access medical care. She added that many women are coerced or threatened by local authorities into registering for the permit, and face strict government surveillance afterward.
Chae-ran claimed her husband and in-laws refused to pay for the documents, leaving her feeling exposed and fearful of detection by Chinese authorities. She had to be careful not to get into accidents when riding her bicycle; she avoided upsetting local residents who threatened to report her to the police; she felt afraid just seeing a police car.
“I lived in China, but I didn’t exist as a person,” she said.

Surveillance under Covid
Life in China only got worse during the pandemic, with the country imposing an unrelenting zero-Covid policy. Residents needed mandatory tests and health QR codes to enter most public places – neither of which Chae-ran could access without identity documents.
When her son’s school asked all parents to submit proof of negative Covid test results, she had to explain to the teacher she was a North Korean refugee. With facial recognition used in parts of China to track individuals’ health status, it felt impossible to hide from the authorities. She confined herself at home, well into the third year of the pandemic.
The pandemic restrictions also made some North Korean trafficking victims more vulnerable to abusive relationships or domestic violence, said Sokeel Park, the South Korea country director for international nonprofit Liberty in North Korea (LINK), which helps North Koreans resettle in the South.
Chae-ran’s son had been the only thing keeping her in China all these years, but she felt she couldn’t keep living in hiding and isolation. When she floated the idea of fleeing to South Korea to her son, then 16, he said he didn’t want to leave.
The other North Korean refugees she’d met in town had connections to brokers who could help them escape, while church organizations and non-profit groups discreetly helped raise funds for the journey. One day last April, she told her family she was going to work; instead, she and a group of refugees fled, traveling across the country to China’s southern border. She didn’t tell her son she was leaving.
From the southern border, they crossed through several neighboring countries and trekked along the Mekong River to Thailand, where they turned themselves in to local police and were put in a Thai detention center.
“It was so hot in the detention center that I even had heat rashes. People in the cell were fighting over everything,” she said. “The hardest thing for us was not knowing when we’ll be able to leave for South Korea.”
A South Korean embassy official helped organize Chae-ran’s eventual journey to South Korea, visiting her and other North Korean refugees in detention and bringing them food. He was the only warm person she met on her long journey to escape, she said, recounting the experience through tears.
A new life in South Korea
In late May, Chae-ran finally arrived in South Korea. Like all North Koreans who enter the South, she underwent security checks and spent time in a facility that teaches defectors to assimilate into society before finally starting her new life in November, six months later.
With financial support from the government, she rented a studio apartment and bought appliances like a washing machine and a television. Churches and non-profit organizations helped her obtain basic goods like winter blankets, utensils and dishes.
Chae-ran was especially excited to receive her South Korean identification documents. “When I got my ID card for the first time, I felt so happy,” she said. “I came to (South) Korea for this one thing, and I finally have it.”

But even with support, adjusting to life in South Korea can often be difficult for refugees.
Some have described struggling with culture shock, loneliness, unemployment or poor working conditions – and hostility from South Koreans, especially in recent years as North Korea has ratcheted up tensions with its neighbor.
In that time, fewer defectors have crossed the border to start a new life. Just 196 North Koreans entered South Korea last year, according to the Unification Ministry – more than the previous two years during the pandemic, but a steep drop from pre-pandemic levels. And most of those defectors left North Korea long ago, staying in third countries for years before arriving in Seoul, according to the ministry.
“It has become much more difficult to escape from inside North Korea,” said Park, from LINK.
Those stuck in China now have fewer avenues of escape because the network of brokers helping transport North Koreans out of the country collapsed during the pandemic, Park said.
Brokers who remain have raised their prices due to increased risks and surveillance, while newcomers to the business are inexperienced, making it a risky gamble for North Korean refugees. That’s not to mention the tightened border security in China and neighboring countries.

For now, Chae-ran is planning for her future. She hopes to one day visit China as a tourist with her newly obtained passport to see her son, who she was able to contact through her sister-in-law in China. She’s received a barista certificate, is working on her driver’s license, and has applied to take a nail care class at the government training facility.
While it can be overwhelming to start from square one – especially in a country with social stigma against North Korean defectors – she’s determined to make it work.
“I’ll face anything, everything,” she said. “I’m aware of discrimination against people like me in this society, but no matter how bad that is, it will be much better than living in China.”",2024-03-09T00:07:12Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network
Apple is paying Samsung and LG $2.9 billion for the OLED panels to be used on the iPad Pro (2024),"A new report from Korea Economic Daily says that Apple has ordered 8.5 million OLED panels from its suppliers for the new iPad Pro (2024) premium tablets due to be unveiled sometime this month. Yes, the new top-of-the-line 11-inch and 12.9-inch (or 13-inch some say) tablets will be the first iPads to feature an OLED display. Compared to LCD screens, OLED displays deliver more accurate colors, deeper blacks, higher contrast ratios, and lower power consumption. They are more expensive so we could be in for some kind of sticker shock when the new iPad Pro models are introduced.
Other reports say that the 8.5 million OLED panels ordered by Apple should be enough to keep the iPad Pro assembly lines humming through the end of this year. In January, we told you that
Other reports say that the 8.5 million OLED panels ordered by Apple should be enough to keep the iPad Pro assembly lines humming through the end of this year. In January, we told you that Apple had originally ordered 10 million OLED panels for the iPad Pro (2024) series but had reduced it by as many as two million panels.
The new report updates this information claiming that Apple has decided on a final amount of 8.5 million OLED panels for the iPad Pro (2024), which will be divided between Samsung Display and LG Display. Samsung Display will produce 4 million OLED panels for the 11-inch iPad Pro while LG Display will make 4.5 million OLED panels for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.
Apple is reportedly spending $290 for each 11-inch display made by Samsung Display and $390 for the 12.9-inch screen produced by LG Display. Overall, the tech giant is spending $2.9 billion for OLED panels. China's BOE, which does supply Apple with OLED panels for some iPhone models, was believed to be in the running for some of this business but will not be supplying Apple with any of the OLED panels for the new iPad Pro (2024) models.
In addition to the new iPad Pro (2024) series, Apple is expected to introduce the iPad Air (2024) at the same time this month. For the first time, there will be two iPad Air models as a variant sporting a 12,9-inch LCD display will join the traditional unit that is equipped with a 10.9-inch LCD screen.",2024-03-08T20:47:32Z,https://www.phonearena.com,PhoneArena
Kim Jong Un Sends Warning to West Amid US-South Korea Drills,"North Korea has issued a stark warning to South Korea and the United States by carrying out large-scale artillery drills.
On March 4, the U.S. and South Korea began Freedom Shield, their annual joint military exercises, which will continue until March 14. During the exercises, North Korea began conducting large-scale artillery drills along its western coast.
As the Freedom Shield exercises continue, the international community watches closely, aware of the delicate balance of power and the potential for escalation in this historically volatile region.
A spokesperson for North Korea's Ministry of National Defense said, ""The large-scale war drills staged by the world's biggest nuclear weapons state ... in the Korean Peninsula, where a nuclear war may be ignited even with a spark, can never be called 'defensive,'"" reported Korean Central News Agency, a state media outlet.
North Korea's drills featured a powerful display of long-range artillery capabilities to reinforce its stance that it has a formidable deterrent against perceived threats.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's aggressive military posture and readiness drills underscore the heightened state of alertness on the Korean peninsula.
Kim's directive for the military to prepare for ""merciless and rapid strikes"" in the event of actual warfare reflects an escalating rhetoric and apparent readiness for confrontation.
The drills were initiated with ""power demonstration strikes of long-range artillery divisions"" situated along the border area, NK News, a specialist publication focusing on North Korea, reported Friday, citing the state media outlet Rodong Sinmun.
These divisions, tasked with a critical role as a war deterrent capable of targeting enemy capitals, executed the exercises to bolster their ""combat mobilization readiness and ability to fight in an actual war,"" Rodong Sinmun added, according to NK News.
Visuals accompanying the report showcased an array of launchers firing in unison toward the sea, indicating the scale and intensity of the drills.
Analysis by NK News suggests these exercises took place in Onchon County near Nampho on the west coast, deploying artillery westward despite claims of operations in border regions. The drills involved at least 20 240 mm multiple rocket launchers and at least 32 self-propelled guns of various types mounted on older trucks in the first Hongyan-Steyr series.

Kim Minseok, a research fellow at the Korea Defense and Security Forum, told Newsweek that South Korea may not be concerned about North Korea's drills.
""The North Korean provocations that Kim Jong Un enjoys the most, and the South Korean military is most nervous about, are ballistic-missile and long-range-multiple-rocket-launcher fire. However, North Korea used 122 mm, 130 mm, 155 mm, [and] 220 mm field artillery and multiple rocket launchers in this drill—no large 400-plus mm multiple rocket launchers and short-range ballistic missiles,"" he said.
Reuters reported Friday that South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff observed North Korea firing multiple rocket-launcher shells and self-propelled artillery shells toward the Yellow Sea from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time Thursday.
The JCS is closely monitoring these military activities amid the ongoing Freedom Shield exercises with the United States, which this year involves twice the number of troops compared to previous iterations, Reuters reported.
Further complicating tensions, North Korea has attempted to jam GPS signals near the South Korean border since Tuesday, an act that the JCS warned could have serious consequences despite causing no immediate damage, Reuters reported.

""North Korea's artillery fire drills are demonstrations to show off their numbers, not tactical exercises. Firing hundreds of field artillery pieces at once in a dense area only measures that they were fired. Modern artillery combat is more about firing accurately from a dispersed position, like the 'shoot and scoot' artillery tactic,"" Kim, the research fellow, told Newsweek.",2024-03-08T16:08:55Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
SK hynix To Invest $1 Billion Into Expanding Semiconductor Packaging Facilities In South Korea,"SK hynix is reportedly investing $1 billion in upscaling current semiconductor packaging facilities as AI demand surges to new levels.
SK hynix Gears Up For Future Demand, As The Firm Expects The AI Hype To Pour In Huge HBM Orders
SK Hynix is witnessing massive market interest, with companies like NVIDIA and AMD seeing the South Korean firm as the first option for their HBM sourcing. This is evident because SK hynix has seen that this year's supply is already selling out.
The firm is now gearing up for a dominant FY 2025, and part of it is expanding existing facilities to cater to the enormous demand from the industry. BNN Bloomberg reports that SK hynix is investing $1 billion in South Korean facilities, as disclosed by the firm's Head of Packaging Development Lee Kang-Wook.
The main focus of the company with this capital injection would be to improve chip packaging since the firm believes it's the next area of interest for the semiconductor markets. Since HBM is playing a primary role in creating the AI equipment fueling the computing power, the necessary advancements are crucial, starting with the onboard packaging.
The first 50 years of the semiconductor industry has been about the front-end. But the next 50 years is going to be all about the back-end. - Lee Kang-Wook
SK hynix looks to an innovative period going further from here. With the company's interest in the industry, the South Korean manufacturer is expected to ramp up its ongoing developments in the HBM sector. The firm was recently said to have reached the testing stages of its 12-layer HBM3E type and had already sent it for qualification tests to NVIDIA. SK hynix was also rumored to have built a strategic alliance with TSMC, where the main focus was collaborating on next-gen HBM standards such as HBM4 for future AI GPUs.
The HBM industry is turning out to be competitive, with companies like SK hynix, Micron, Samsung Foundry, and others presenting their solutions for the markets. The critical point of distinction lies in how each firm deals with colossal demand while ensuring an innovative approach.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided an artillery firing drill by the Korean People’s Army, the country’s military force, state media KCNA reported on Friday.
The drill, carried out on Thursday, involved units near the border that are in firing range of “the enemy’s capital,” KCNA said, referring to the South Korean capital of nearly 10 million residents and added it “fulfilled important military missions for war deterrence.”
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said North Korea’s military test-fired multiple rocket launcher shells and self-propelled artillery shells toward the Yellow Sea on Thursday.
The JCS said it was monitoring the North’s military activities as joint drills conducted by South Korean and U.S. militaries are underway. The drills, known as the Freedom Shield exercises, began on Monday with twice the number of troops joining compared to last year.
North Korea has also made “multiple attempts” to jam GPS signals near the border in South Korea since Tuesday, the JCS said in a separate statement, adding no damage was caused but warning of consequences.

Thursday’s artillery drill by North Korea aimed to increase combat readiness and war capability, KCNA said.
Kim urged the military to push forward with preparations so the artillery sub-units could “take the initiative with merciless and rapid strikes at the moment of their entry into an actual war.”
“He stressed the need to train all the artillery men of the whole army into experts in artillery engagement ... and set forth important tasks for rounding off the artillery war preparations,” the report said, referring to the leader of the reclusive state.
Photographs published by KCNA showed balls of flame from artillery fire and Kim dressed in a black leather jacket and flanked by soldiers watching from a dug out.
Seoul’s defense minister, Shin Won-sik, visited the Capital Defense Command on Thursday and ordered a firm response if North Korea made provocations aimed at the capital.

Ola’s Krutrim Needs Korea’s Align AI,"Listen to this story
The recent Krutrim fiasco has put the spotlight on the complexities and potential pitfalls of deploying LLMs without adequate oversight and analysis. The repercussions often come in the form of misrepresentation and biases sparking backlash from users and the developer community.
These instances have underscored the need for a sophisticated analytics tool capable of navigating the intricacies of AI-native products. Enter Align AI, a Korea-based analytics tool designed specifically for AI-native products.
Align AI, often likened to “Google Analytics for ChatGPT-like chatbots”, offers a seamless way for companies to collect all user interaction data, including conversation data, with just a few lines of code.
This capability is crucial for identifying and addressing potential issues such as prompt injection attacks or biases in AI responses, thereby safeguarding against business and legal risks.
In an interaction with AIM, Yeop Lee, head of product at Align AI, explained how their product is revolutionising the way companies handle conversational AI analytics.
Subscribe to our Newsletter Join our editors every weekday evening as they steer you through the most significant news of the day, introduce you to fresh perspectives, and provide unexpected moments of joy Email Sign up Your newsletter subscriptions are subject to AIM Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.
Lee emphasised the platform’s ability to address and mitigate risks associated with conversational AI. “Leveraging our natural language universal search, as well as our insights feature, we’ve been able to capture all sorts of risks that customers may be facing,” Lee stated, highlighting a case where Align AI helped a customer detect and prevent prompt injection attacks by malicious users.
Align AI’s value proposition extends beyond monitoring, to include analytics aimed at product improvement and revenue generation. “The first [value] is monitoring… making sure that these aren’t happening and the product is running the way it’s supposed to,” Lee explained.
The second value revolves around analytics, focusing on enhancing the product to increase user willingness to pay.
The Birth of Align AI
GiJung Kim, CEO and founder of Align AI, shared the unique journey and vision behind the creation of Align AI.
Starting as a B2C generative AI consumer-level product team in 2021, the team’s focus was always on building a superior AI product for users. However, they encountered a significant challenge: the absence of a robust tool to analyse user interactions with their AI.
This gap in the market led to the pivot towards developing Align AI. “There was no good tool for us to analyse how our users are interacting with our own AI,” Kim, recounted.
This realisation came as early as 2020, but the team’s commitment to their B2C product delayed addressing this issue until a fortunate turn of events in March 2023, when they sold their product to Sandal, a listed company in Korea. This sale provided the necessary resources and freedom to focus on solving the problem of analysing user interactions for AI-native products.
Kim also highlighted the origin of the team, which started as a research team in a university lab, later disrupted by COVID-19. This disruption led them to live together and embark on an AI project, laying the foundation for what would become Align AI.
“We weren’t expecting to build Align AI from the beginning… we were just riding the generative AI wave,” Kim stated.
Tech Stack
The founder provided an in-depth explanation of how their product processes and utilises conversational data from clients.
Once the data is ingested, Align AI focuses on making it readable through indexing and programmatic labelling, which allows for efficient searching and extraction of important data. “We need to index the data well, and we need to extract the important data well, and then we need to index that as well,” Kim stated.
This process enables Align AI to match conversation data with search queries effectively. Kim described a re-ranking method used to organise search results according to their relevance to the user’s query, ensuring that clients can easily access the information they need.
Align AI’s backend primarily uses Go (Golang), with the frontend in React. For AI components, they utilise both OpenAI API and their proprietary AI models, depending on the task.
“For most of the generating part, we have to stick with OpenAI because performance-wise, it’s the best in the market,” Kim mentioned, highlighting the blend of open-source models and OpenAI’s API to achieve optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
He explained, “For retrieving the data or just getting the keywords out, like extracting the keyword, those parts, actually open source models are good enough and a lot cheaper.”
Align AI also focuses on building its own embedding models to reduce dependency on OpenAI.
Clientele and Focus on Indian Market
In terms of clientele, Align AI has expanded beyond Korea, onboarding customers from the US, EU, and India, with a focus on English-speaking users in the early stages. The Indian market, in particular, is seen as a key area for expansion due to its strong engineering focus and proficiency in English.
Kim expressed high expectations for the Indian market, considering it a significant focus area for their expansion. “India is going to be a very important market for us,” Kim stated, noting the proficiency in English among Indian users as a key advantage for early-stage understanding of customer needs.
During a visit to the Machine Learning Developers Summit (MLDS) organised by AIM, Kim observed a vibrant community of Indian engineers and entrepreneurs actively engaging with frontier technologies, including AI chatbots.
This encounter led to unexpected connections with Indian entrepreneurs, who began signing up for Align AI’s product without any targeted marketing efforts from the company. “We began forging connections with Indian entrepreneurs. They were able to find our product and they started signing up,” Kim recounted, highlighting the organically piqued interest in Align AI within the Indian tech community
Align AI founded in 2021 by Gijung Kim, Joowon Kim, and Juyoung Jeong has undergone two rounds of funding, including a recent $3.5 million seed round, and is looking to address the challenges of multimodality in AI, anticipating a future where virtual humans interact with users in real-time in a highly personalised manner.
What’s Next?
Kim also shared insights into the company’s future vision, emphasising the shift towards hyper-personalised AI experiences. He believes that AI integration into products is inevitable, likening the initial versions of AI that users interact with to children who need to learn and grow.
This perspective underscores the value of Align AI’s product in enhancing AI interactions. “Hyper-personalised experience is the future. We have to shift the focus not only to the company, but more towards individuals,” Kim stated, highlighting the need for multimodality and the evolving landscape of AI interactions.
Kim also discussed the importance of multimodal data analysis, predicting the emergence of virtual humans interacting with users in real-time in a highly personalised manner within the next few years. This vision emphasises Align AI’s role in advancing conversational AI analytics and supporting the growth of AI-native products.
Align AI is poised to make a significant impact in the Indian market and beyond, with a strong product offering and a vision that aligns with the needs of a tech-savvy and English-proficient user base.",2024-03-08T10:27:01Z,https://analyticsindiamag.com,Analytics India Magazine
South Korea to boost young doctors’ pay even as it denies healthcare is in crisis,"SEOUL - South Korea will move quickly to improve pay and working conditions for young doctors, the government said on March 8, tackling a key demand by medical trainees who have walked off the job, but denying there was a full-scale healthcare crisis.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said the current practice of forcing young doctors to work 36 hours at a stretch was partly responsible for their protest walkout and must be changed.
""We will start the trial as soon as possible,"" he said, adding that the government would consider limiting to 24 hours the period that resident doctors and interns must work continuously.
More than 10,000 medical interns and resident doctors are protesting against a government plan to increase medical school admissions by 2,000 a year to tackle a shortage of doctors. The country has one of the world’s fastest-ageing populations.
The striking doctors argue that simply adding medical students will not address pay and work conditions, and could possibly exacerbate the problems.
While not backing off the government’s plans for more medical students, the proposals outlined by Mr Han appeared aimed at finding common ground with the protesters.
The striking doctors and medical associations that have been critical of the government did not immediately publicly comment on the proposals.
From March, trainee doctors in paediatrics will receive a monthly allowance of 1 million won (S$1,010), and the government plans similar payments for other trainee doctors, Mr Han said.
It will start with those in essential specialisations such as emergency medicine and general surgery and will allocate additional government funds, he said.
President Yoon Suk-yeol has spearheaded a package of medical reform plans and taken a hard line against the protesters, moving to suspend their medical licences for defying return-to-work orders.
While he said their action had created ""chaos"" in major hospitals that employ trainee doctors as a key share of their staff, officials said on March 8 that the situation has stabilised, partly because other doctors and nurses took on extra work.
""To suggest, as some have done, that we have a healthcare crisis is an exaggeration,"" said Vice-Health Minister Park Min-soo.",2024-03-08T09:11:57Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
Vantage | How South Korea became a cultural superpower,"Today, culture is one of South Korea’s largest exports. It has helped the nation become Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, cementing its credentials as a cultural superpower

South Korea’s creative rise came from its lowest point, after the Korean War of the 1950s, when it was emerging from abject poverty. However, by the turn of the century, it had come a long way. It was going to become an electronic success story, but that’s when South Korea suffered a second blow.
Advertisement
In the economic crash of 1997, Seoul was forced to ask the IMF for a bailout—still known as the “Day of National Humility.” It was a loan of 60 billion dollars. Collective sacrifices were made to pay off the debt. That was an emotional low point, but then Seoul made up its mind to turn things around.
South Korea needed “national rebranding,” and the government took cultural identity and turned it into an exportable commodity.
“Hallyu” (Korean wave) was born—the phenomenal growth of Korean pop culture—from K-pop to K-beauty.
Today, culture is one of South Korea’s largest exports. It has helped the nation become Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, cementing its credentials as a cultural superpower.

Pop culture
Gangnam Style wriggled its way across the world, making history as the first YouTube video with one billion views.
This breakthrough smoothed the road for K-pop, and today, the industry is massive. Bands like BTS and Blackpink have conquered the world. BTS reportedly adds about four billion dollars to the South Korean economy each year. K-pop is practically the biggest part of its content industry, which hit a record high in 2021 with a value of 12.4 billion dollars.

It dwarfed earnings from home appliances and vehicles, for which South Korea was once popular.
Korean dramas and films are big business as well. Four years ago, “Parasite” won an Oscar. Three years ago, “Squid Game” became the most watched show on Netflix.
Netflix is investing 2.5 billion dollars in South Korean projects. Disney and Apple TV are commissioning more Korean shows.
Advertisement
Food and cosmetics
Korean cuisine is penetrating global markets. It is worth 77 billion dollars. Meanwhile, K-beauty is the latest rage. Hordes of tourists are flocking to South Korea to buy cosmetics like snail mucin and face masks. The k-beauty market is expected to be worth 18 billion dollars in 2030.
South Korean culture is a big hit, and it has achieved that through a near-perfect marriage between public and private effort after the IMF crisis.
Advertisement
Kim Dae-jung, the then Korean president, threw money at the content industry and laid its foundation. But just as the government pushed funding, private players stepped in and poured billions of dollars into creative industries, and this boosted the industry.
Literature
The Korean wave shows no signs of stopping. Many say that the next big thing is literature. There is a growing demand to learn the Korean language. So South Korea wants to tap into this. It wants to export stories and share them with the world.
Every nation has powerful stories; most nations would want to share them; the key is to figure out how. As they say, heroes are made by the path they choose, not the powers they are graced with.

North Korea showcases artillery that poses a deadly threat to the South,"By Brad Lendon, CNN
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) — North Korea on Thursday showed off its long-range artillery systems, thousands of weapons that it could use to strike the South with little warning while causing tens of thousands of casualties, according to experts.
The North’s artillery drills come at a time of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula as the United States and South Korea conduct their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which the South Korean military said will focus on deterring North Korea’s nuclear threats.
North Korea’s Defense Ministry on Monday denounced the 11-day US-South Korea joint exercises as “provocative” and “reckless,” and warned North Korean forces will monitor “adventurist acts” and conduct “responsible military activities” to bring what it called an unstable security situation under control, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Thursday’s artillery exercise was the North’s second drill this week, a day after its ground forces appeared to infiltrate border guard posts during maneuvers.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un observed both drills and was seen in photos provided by state media.
A KCNA report on Friday said the artillery drill sent a message to the South.
“The drill started with the power demonstration firing of the long-range artillery sub-units near the border who have put the enemy’s capital in their striking range and fulfilled important military missions for war deterrence,” the KCNA report said.
Kim stressed the importance of preparing “for regular combat mobilization so that all the artillery sub-units can take the initiative with merciless and rapid strikes at the moment of their entry into an actual war,” the report said.
Ever-present threat
North Korea’s artillery systems have been making headlines in recent weeks as Pyongyang is arming Russian forces with them for combat in Ukraine.
Since August, Pyongyang has shipped about 6,700 containers to Russia, which could accommodate more than 3 million rounds of artillery shells or more than 500,000 rounds for multiple rocket launchers, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.
While those weapons present a big challenge for Ukraine’s defenders, they are also an ever-present looming threat for South Korea and the US military forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula.
Artillery strikes are almost impossible to defend against, experts say.
A 2020 report from the RAND Corp. think tank said North Korea’s artillery systems, with nearly 6,000 big guns within range of major South Korean population centers, present as great a danger to the South as Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programs.
“If fired at civilian targets, those nearly 6,000 systems could potentially kill more than 10,000 people in only an hour,” the RAND report said.
In one scenario, a one-minute barrage on a 2.4-square-kilometer area of the capital Seoul using just 54 multiple rocket launchers, predicted more than 10,000 casualties.
“Because (North Korean) shelling could kill many thousands in just an hour, with little warning, it would be difficult for the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States, once the bombardment had begun, to halt it, or otherwise protect the ROK population, before it could do very serious harm,” the report said.
Even retaliatory strikes by South Korea and the US would be difficult to execute, the report said.
“Much of the DPRK’s artillery is located in heavily fortified hardened artillery sites (HARTS) with air defense capabilities deployed to their rear. These physical protective measures make air strikes and counter-battery fire against the DPRK artillery a challenge for U.S. and ROK forces,” the report said.
Kim has drawn an increasingly harder line against South Korea in recent months, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and instructing the country’s army, munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US.
In January, Kim called the South the North’s “primary foe and invariable principal enemy” and ordered a reunification monument in the North Korean capital to be demolished.

Kim said artillery units must “take the initiative with merciless and rapid strikes at the moment of their entry into an actual war,” KCNA said.
North Korea’s forward-deployed long-range artillery guns pose a serious security threat to Seoul, a city with 10 million people which is about 40 to 50 kilometers (25 to 30 miles) from the border with North Korea.
North Korea’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it would conduct unspecified “responsible military activities” in response to the annual South Korea-U.S. military drills that are to end on March 14. Kim visited a western operational training ground on Wednesday and called for stronger war fighting capabilities.
The South Korean-U.S. drills began on Monday and involve a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last year.
North Korea views South Korea-U.S. military exercises as a major security threat, calling them a preparation to launch attacks on the North. Seoul and Washington officials have said their drills are defensive in nature.
North Korea has sharply accelerated its missile testing activities since 2022 in part of efforts to develop more powerful nuclear-capable weapons targeting the U.S. mainland and South Korea. The South Korean and U.S. militaries have expanded their drills in response.
Experts say North Korea likely aims to use a modernized arsenal to win sanctions relief from the United States when diplomacy restarts. They say North Korea could increase its weapons tests and dial up warlike rhetoric this year as the United States and South Korea hold major elections.",2024-03-08T00:56:04Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail

"Wartime footage, anger with Seoul, and a gift from Vladimir Putin: Is North Korea (actually) planning to go to war?","Beyond firing artillery rounds into the sea and launching spy satellites, North Korea has been busy removing references and images of reunification with South Korea from its state-run websites, creating alarm among experts.
The moves are the latest concrete evidence that the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, might be implementing a pledge made in January where he called South Korea a ""primary foe"" and concluded that reunification was no longer possible.
Pyongyang's decision to abandon the decades-long goal of reunification — in addition to rekindled relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin — has contributed to escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, to a degree that has some experts tabling the possibility that conflict might be imminent.
Here's a look at what's led to the current situation, how experts are interpreting the shifts in rhetoric amid the current global context, and whether or not yet another conflict might genuinely be on the brink of breaking out.
What has been going on？

The initial bombshell came when Mr Kim called for a rewriting of the country's constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful reunification with South Korea — and to cement Seoul as an ""invariable principal enemy"" — in a speech to the Supreme People's Assembly earlier this year.
During his speech, Mr Kim blamed South Korea and the United States for raising tensions in the region, citing their expanded joint military exercises, deployments of US strategic military assets, and their trilateral security cooperation with Japan as turning the peninsula into a dangerous war-prone zone.
Following Mr Kim's speech, the North's assembly abolished key government agencies that have been instrumental to decades of exchanges with Seoul.
Satellite imagery of Pyongyang showed that a major monument in the capital that symbolised the goal of reconciliation with South Korea was destroyed after the speech.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that articles containing unification references have consistently been removed from North Korea's platforms and messaging: for example, a red-coloured logo of the Korean Peninsula has been removed from the North's official Foreign Trade site banners.
Mr Kim's remarks were made amid escalating tensions on the peninsula.
Since January, the North has fired hundreds of artillery shells into the sea near the disputed maritime border with the South and tested what it said was a solid-fuel missile fitted with a hypersonic warhead.
Last month, the North's state media reported that the Supreme People's Assembly had voted to scrap all agreements with its neighbour aimed at promoting economic cooperation.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol criticised this move to define his country as hostile, saying it showed Pyongyang's ""anti-national and ahistorical"" nature.
Seoul has also ramped up joint military exercises with Japan and the US focused on countering the North's potential use of nuclear weapons, which Mr Kim has portrayed as invasion rehearsals.
What's the significance and how are experts interpreting it?

Since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a stalemate, both Koreas have had policies that treat each other differently than other countries.
That included relying on special agencies and ministries for inter-Korean relations rather than their foreign ministries, and embracing policies for a future peaceful reunification, usually envisioning a single state with two systems.
Colin Alexander, a senior lecturer of political communication at Nottingham Trent University, said scrapping the rhetoric of reunification is a ""strategic observation the North has made about politics in the South"".
""South Korea has oscillated between being more inclined towards reunification and [then] moving really far away from it,"" he said.
While South Korea's former president Moon Jae-In pushed for greater dialogue with the North, the current conservative government led by Mr Yoon took a much harder stance towards its neighbour.
""My interpretation is that North Korea is interpreting this inconsistency with a lot of frustration … and what they realise is [reunification] is so unachievable within the present outlook, that they must move towards a policy which is more realistic.""
Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also recently said that the North has been recalibrating its regional approach since the collapse of the 2019 Hanoi summit.

""But now, with advanced nuclear and missile capabilities — and the support of Russia and China — Mr Kim feels confident enough to make these changes, which amount to his most consequential proclamations on external affairs since taking power in North Korea,"" Mr Panda said.
Russia and North Korea have forged closer ties since Mr Kim and Mr Putin met in September last year and pledged to promote exchanges in all areas as their respective international isolation has deepened over Russia's war in Ukraine and the North's ongoing nuclear weapons developments.
As a symbol of their rekindled ties, Mr Putin recently gifted Mr Kim with a Russian-made Aurus luxury limousine — the same type of car Mr Putin is often seen riding around in himself.
Could the situation lead to war?

Rising tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul have led many experts to scramble to speculate over the last few months on what sorts of scenarios may lie ahead.
In a report published on the US-based 38 North project, former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker said the situation on the peninsula was ""more dangerous than it has been at any time since early June 1950"", shortly before the start of the Korean War.
The authors added in no uncertain terms that they believe Mr Kim ""has made a strategic decision to go to war"" and that ""the danger is already far beyond the routine warnings in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo about Pyongyang's 'provocations'"".
Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, added that the policy changes could be perceived as helping North Korea justify using nuclear weapons against the South, as it has increasingly threatened in recent years.
""If they give up on peaceful unification and redefine South Korea as a hostile enemy country with no diplomatic relations, the contradiction of using nuclear weapons against the same people will be eliminated,"" Mr Hong said.
But other analysts, as well as officials in Washington and Seoul, say they have spotted no serious signs Pyongyang intends to take imminent military action.
For example, South Korean Defence Minister Shin Won-sik wrote off the claims of increasing risk of war during a recent radio interview as ""excessive exaggeration"", adding that such interpretations play into the hands of North Korea's psychological warfare.

Dr Alexander added that Mr Kim's war threats should also be understood in the context of the North's culture where ""national prestige is built around military issues"".
""Because of this propaganda concept North Korean government created domestically, it leads them to having to consistently discuss the military and its readiness [for war].""
But North Korea does not have a ""rationale"" to actually start a war, Dr Alexander said.
""[Because] if North Korea were to attack the South or anywhere else, there will be significant negative consequences for it.""

Where to invest and what to buy in emerging markets,"Investors, however, should not view emerging markets as a uniform group.
They span the spectrum in geography, development and degrees of resiliency. This creates a diversified opportunity set for portfolios. A judicious combination of emerging market exposures could drive attractive performance.
Sovereigns offering attractive yields
So, where can investors find value in emerging markets this year?
The best opportunity looks to be within emerging market hard currency sovereigns – government bonds issued by emerging market countries in stable currencies such as US dollars.
As emerging markets continue to normalise from their multi-year shock, their economies remain resilient, and financing needs will be manageable.
Advertisement
Based on current yields, emerging market hard currency sovereigns’ returns are already attractive.
Even a mild spread tightening could raise their total returns to double digits, while core developed market sovereign bonds yields are declining. Spread tightening refers to the reducing difference in yields between two bonds of the same maturity but different credit quality.
Against the backdrop of declining inflation, mild economic growth and the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy easing, the spreads between higher-quality developed market investment-grade assets and riskier high-yield emerging market bonds will probably tighten.
Regionally, there are opportunities in central Europe, Latin America and Asia.
To avoid default risk, some countries – including Zambia, Ghana and Sri Lanka – are likely to embark on sovereign debt restructuring, a process in which the government changes the terms on loans to make them easier to pay back.
This could ultimately be positive for investors.
Advertisement
Other structural changes that positively affect segments of emerging markets include reducing supply chain reliance on China, and the prospect of increased foreign direct investment across other emerging markets.
There is value in emerging market corporate BB-rated and BBB-rated bonds in countries such as India and Mexico that are growing strongly and benefiting from this shift away from China.
Friend-shoring – a growing practice where supply chain networks are focused on political and economic allies – could also benefit countries already well connected to existing trade chains and will likely continue to attract investments from existing partners.
Value in foreign exchange
Within local rates, long rates in Latin America are attractive, while more mixed in Asia.
Disinflationary trends remain in many emerging markets, and real rates are positive.
Advertisement
Specifically, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea stand out, as Brazil is expected to cut rates below 9 per recent and Mexico should start cutting rates in the first half of this year. Caution is advised for South Africa, Hungary and Chile.
In emerging market foreign exchange (EMFX), one should not expect persistently strong US dollar performance given expectations of Fed rate cuts. Alpha opportunities exist in relative EMFX positions.
Many of the most preferable emerging markets currencies tend to be high carry, or are benefiting from relatively higher growth and flows.
In Latin America, the Brazilian real and Mexico peso look attractive.
In Asia, relative value positions favour Indian rupee and Philippine peso versus the New Taiwan dollar.
Investors should remain mindful of tail risks from global growth uncertainty and geopolitics – especially for countries where elections will take place this year, such as Mexico, India, South Africa and the US.
Advertisement
A barbell approach – investing in a mix of resilient investment-grade and higher-quality BB sovereign, quasi-sovereign and corporate bonds in the seven- to 10-year part of the curve – could drive better outcomes.
With the macro story of high inflation and escalating interest rates fading into the rearview mirror, this will be a year when an active investment strategy based on fundamental analysis and valuations of debt securities will be critical.
Last year’s returns in emerging markets debt more than held their own – the set-up for this year should attract investors back to the sector.",2024-03-07T20:22:42Z,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review
Song Joong-ki spills why 'My Name is Loh Kiwan' role took 7 years to accept,"My Name is Loh Kiwan starring Song Joong-ki released on Netflix on March 1
Song Joong Ki delved into the perspective that made him take on the role of Loh Kiwan in Netflix’s My Name is Loh Kiwan after first rejecting it.
The Korea Times reported that during an interview following the release of the South Korean drama film on March 1, the Descendents of the Sun star revealed that he turned down the script seven years ago.
""Upon first reading the script and considering portraying Loh, I harboured doubts, questioning: 'How can someone who has come this far consider falling in love as an option?' The character's emotions weren't convincing enough for me,"" he explained.
However, the 38-year-old actor noted that upon revisiting the script five years later, he could imagine himself in Loh’s shoes and connect with his emotions.
""Although the script remained largely unchanged, my perspective had evolved,"" the Vincenzo star continued, ""I came to believe that what drives people to endure is relying on others, which, to me, embodies the essence of love.""
He said, ""It was this realisation that persuaded me of the romance in the film and led me to accept the role.""
By sharing his then-and-now experience with the script, Joong-ki urged fans, who questioned the romance aspect of the film, to rewatch it to understand the narrative and empathise with the protagonist.",2024-03-07T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Invest in women for a gender dividend to transform India,"In the 1990s, South Korea faced a pivotal moment in its economic development. At the time, the country was rapidly industrializing and seeking ways to sustain its economic growth. Recognizing the untapped potential of half its population, South Korea embarked on a series of reforms aimed at increasing women’s participation in the workforce and promoting gender equality. One of Seoul’s key initiatives was the revision of its Equal Employment Act in 1999, which strengthened protections against gender discrimination in the workplace and encouraged the hiring and promotion of women. Additionally, the government invested in childcare facilities and parental leave policies, making it easier for women to balance work and family responsibilities.
The results of these efforts were transformative. By the early 2000s, South Korea’s female labour force participation rate had increased significantly, contributing to the country’s economic growth and resilience. The increased participation of women in the country’s workforce not only brought in new talent and perspectives, but also led to a more diverse and dynamic economy.
Moreover, the emphasis on gender equality extended beyond the workforce. Education reforms ensured that girls had equal access to quality education, leading to a highly educated female population that further fuelled economic development. Today, South Korea is known for its technological advancements and innovative industries, a testament to the power of increasing women’s participation in the workforce and investing in gender equality.
“Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress,"" is this year’s international clarion call on gender equity, and it demands urgent action. In India, despite commendable advancements, the shadow of gender inequality and discrimination looms large, particularly in access to health, education, and economic opportunities. The deep-rooted patriarchal structure of Indian society that has given rise to unfavourable social norms worsens this inequality. According to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), in 2019-21, almost one in four women aged 20-24 were married before 18, around 8% of women aged 15-19 were mothers or pregnant within the past 12 months of the survey, and 59% of young women aged 15-19 were anaemic. The NHFS-5 also highlights that nearly 30% of married women aged 18-49 have experienced domestic and/or sexual violence, and about 12% of currently married women are unable to participate in three key household decisions: healthcare for themselves, making major household purchases, and visits to family or relatives. Only 54% of women have access to mobile phones for their personal use. These numbers paint a picture of a society where a large proportion of women, despite their undeniable potential, remain marginalized.
Such disparities hinder women’s economic participation. According to the 2023 Gender Gap report, India has achieved only 36.7% of gender parity in economic participation, which means that the country lags behind even many of the world’s least developed countries on this count. According to the International Labour Organisation, only 24% of women participate in the paid labour market, and earn about 33% less than men. While 80% of economically active women are in agriculture, just 13% own agricultural land, according to a study by Oxfam India.
Gender equality and women’s empowerment are standalone goals among the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 5: Gender Equality) and are duly recognized as instrumental in achieving other SDGs related to health, education, poverty eradication, economic empowerment, peace and justice, among others. With the government aiming for a Viksit Bharat (developed India) by 2047, our investments in gender parity assume heightened importance.
To leverage a ‘gender dividend’—the economic and social benefits of closing gender gaps in an economy—India must prioritize policies and actions focused on women and girls, supported by strong investments. The country should adopt a ‘life-cycle’ approach for empowerment at every life stage and provide gender-responsive work environments with improved financial access.
Investment in girls’ secondary education is crucial, given the correlation between education and delayed marriage. Enabling girls to complete at least senior secondary education will help them gain financial independence. We also need to generate decent work for women, especially close to their homes, backed by adequate investments in reducing the burden of domestic work and child care.
Comprehensive sexuality education should be included in school curricula and for out-of-school adolescents. This is essential for adolescents to develop the knowledge, attitudes, skills and values needed for their health and well-being, and for normalizing conversations around sexual and reproductive health. Expanding access to modern family planning methods is critical, as 9% of women are still deprived of it. The success of Mission Parivar Vikas suggests the potential for further improvements and scaling up, with specific geographical and population contexts kept in mind. Social and behavioural change campaigns are also vital to counter regressive social norms that often lead to early marriages, unwanted pregnancies and gender-based violence.
We need concerted action. Let us reaffirm our commitment to invest in women and accelerate progress towards a more equitable society.",2024-03-07T18:30:00Z,https://www.livemint.com,Livemint
"Terra’s Do Kwon to Be Extradited to South Korea Instead of US, Montenegro Court Rules","(Bloomberg) -- Montenegro’s High Court said former cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon should be handed over to his native South Korea rather than the US for prosecution over the $40 billion collapse of the TerraUSD stable-coin in 2022.
It’s the latest twist in the legal journey for the Terraform Labs Pte co-founder, who was a fugitive from South Korean charges for months before he was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for traveling on a fake passport. Kwon’s arrest set off dueling extradition requests by prosecutors in Seoul and New York.
The ruling is a win for Kwon, whose lawyers have expressed a preference for him to go to South Korea. Penalties for white-collar crimes are lower there than in the US. Kwon’s fellow former crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried is now facing potentially decades in prison after he was convicted of fraud in New York in November. The FTX co-founder was prosecuted by the Manhattan US attorney’s office, which also indicted Kwon on fraud charges.
A spokesman for that office declined to comment on Thursday.
But it’s unclear if this ruling is the final word. The Montenegrin court last month ordered that Kwon be sent to the US, a decision that was overturned this week. Court spokeswoman Marija Rakovic said Kwon could be extradited soon unless prosecutors appeal. Goran Rodic, a lawyer for Kwon in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica, said extradition could proceed after Kwon finished serving his sentence on the passport charges later this month.
On the other hand, the geopolitical situation facing the tiny Balkan nation, a NATO member, favor extradition to the US, and it’s possible the government is contemplating measures to ensure that happens.
Terraform Chief Financial Officer Han Chang-joon, who was arrested with Kwon in Montenegro, was extradited to South Korea last month.
The collapse of Terra was a seismic event in the crypto markets, and set off a downturn that went on to engulf other players like FTX. Meant to keep a constant value of $1 via a complex mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving its free-floating sister token Luna, Terra was designed as a refuge from the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. But both Luna and Terra unraveled when confidence in Kwon’s project evaporated during a few chaotic days in early May 2022.
Losses from Terra’s collapse caused a public outcry in South Korea, where Kwon was charged breaching capital markets law a few months later. Manhattan federal prosecutors didn’t file their charges against Kwon until after his arrest. According to their indictment, he misled investors about the blockchain technology behind Terra.
Even if Kwon is extradited to South Korea, the government there could still reach a deal to have him tried in New York first. The US could argue that it has a stronger ability to seize Kwon’s assets around the world and agree to share them with South Korea.
In the 1MDB case, Malaysia released ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Roger Ng from custody so he could be prosecuted — and sentenced — in New York first. Despite receiving a 10-year prison term, Ng is currently free in Malaysia assisting in that country’s investigation into the looting of the sovereign wealth fund.
Kwon and Terraform are also facing a US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over Terra’s collapse. Such civil cases are often put on hold while prosecutions go forward, but with Kwon’s extradition still uncertain, the SEC suit is going to trial in Manhattan federal court at the end of the month. Unlike in a criminal trial, Kwon’s presence in the courtroom isn’t required.

"South Korea and Cuba establish ties, rattling North Korea","South Korea has scored a diplomatic victory against its rivals in Pyongyang by establishing formal ties with the government in Cuba, long seen as North Korea’s unshakeable ally.
In mid-February, Seoul announced it would be opening a diplomatic mission in Havana, Cuba’s capital, to help South Korean companies gain a new foothold in the Caribbean, provide a new outlet to promote Korean culture and enable the island nation to benefit from new sources of development and other assistance.
The South Korean government did not mention whether the move would impact Cuba’s traditionally close relations with North Korea.

However, analysts agree that Seoul was in part motivated by a desire to weaken Pyongyang’s network of allies. They point out that this is the very same tactic that North Korea has attempted in the past.
No statement from Pyongyang
There has been no official comment from the North Korean government, and state-run media have not reported the new Seoul-Havana ties, although sources in North Korea quoted by NK News, an American news website, say Cuba is being described as a “traitor nation.”
In further indications of Pyongyang’s displeasure, it pointed out North Korean newspapers have stopped reporting on news about Cuba, which was previously the third most cited nation in domestic media after China and Russia.
Significantly, the name of the Cuban ambassador to Pyongyang was left out of media reports about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s birthday celebrations in late February.

In years past, Cuba was often praised in state-run media as North Korea’s friend and ally.
North Korea was delighted, for example, when Havana declared that its athletes would not take part in the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympic Games in solidarity with the North, even though other communist allies of Pyongyang sent their competitors to attend the Games.
The two Communist-ruled nations maintained their ties in the decades to come, defying international sanctions. In 2013, Panamanian officials discovered missile components and parts for two obsolete Mig-21 fighter jets buried under bags of sugar aboard a North Korean freighter, which Cuba reportedly sent to North Korea for repairs.
South Korea sees Cuba as ‘interesting and mysterious’
That sort of cooperation pales into insignificance when compared to the windfall that South Korean trade, tourists and development assistance can bring to the island nation.

“Cuba was one of the last countries in the world that South Korea did not have diplomatic relations with, and it was widely understood that it is important for Seoul to have as many international ties as possible,” said Kim Seong-kyung, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
“The Korean public also sees Cuba as an interesting and mysterious country, and it is likely this will lead to an increase in tourism,” Kim told DW.
“Yes, this will have come as a big shock to North Korea, and it is also a surprise that they were able to keep it a secret from Pyongyang,” said Rah Jong-yil, a former diplomat and head of the South Korean intelligence department charged with monitoring North Korea.
“Cuba has always been a very faithful partner, but things have changed,” he said. “South Korea has been stepping up tourism and commercial exchanges in recent years, and there are more links between the two governments, so this is a natural progression for both countries.”
Pyongyang forced to bring diplomats home
Advertisement
The diplomatic thaw between Havana and Seoul comes as the North is being forced to shut a number of its embassies around the world, notably in Spain, Hong Kong, Angola and Uganda.
Some suggest this is due to Pyongyang struggling to cover the costs associated with operating the diplomatic outposts, but analysts have also suggested North Korean leadership is reducing the risk of its diplomats defecting while abroad.
At the same time, reports are that Poland, Sweden, and several other European countries are starting to inspect their diplomatic facilities in Pyongyang, which have been closed since the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.
“North Korea is trying to stretch out its diplomatic links, but it will be in shock that the South has diplomatic relations with Cuba now,” Kim said.

Thaw between Seoul and Havana ‘inevitable’
Rah also sees the change as a diplomatic setback for the North. However, he argues that was “inevitable” that Cuba would seek to forge ties with Seoul sooner or later, given the discrepancies in the wealth and development of the two Koreas.
“North Korea has been losing ground on the South for many decades, so it is hard to say that there is any sort of diplomatic ‘competition’ between them anymore,” he said. “It is like a heavyweight boxer taking on a lightweight, and the outcome is obvious.”",2024-03-07T17:56:37Z,https://indianexpress.com,The Indian Express
North Korea's Kim Personally Leads 'Actual War Drill',"Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday oversaw North Korean troops as they demonstrated their ""actual war capability.""
Kim impressed on the soldiers the importance of intensifying such ""actual war drills"" in preparation to ""contain the constant threat of the enemies with overwhelming force,"" according to state media.
The North Korean war game coincided with Freedom Shield, an annual drill jointly kicked off this week by South Korea and the American forces based there, with a focus on countering nuclear operations. North Korea said the exercise is a provocation and warned last week that Washington and Seoul would ""pay a dear price.""
Newsweek reached out to U.S. Forces Korea with a written request for comment.
During Kim's visit to the training grounds, reportedly in the country's western region, he remarked that the site closely resembled the conditions of a real war. He commended the combatants for their ""strong revolutionary spirit and the indomitable fighting spirit.""

Kim stressed that the Korean People's Army must adapt to the fast-changing landscape of modern warfare.
The 40-year-old leader also joined a photo session with soldiers. State media said they ""pledged their intense loyalty to Kim Jong Un, who guided their training and gave them great trust, encouragement and matchless courage and pluck, and hardened their resolve to fully discharge their honorable duty.""
The demonstration took place against a backdrop of decades-high tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
Kim's regime's recent signaling suggests it has sidelined the prospect of de-escalation after a brief period of warming ties in the late 2010s.
The North's steadily progressing nuclear and ballistic missile programs and recent live fire drills near South Korean islands have added to the South's anxieties.
In November, the North launched its first surveillance satellite in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. Pyongyang said the move was necessary for national defense and has vowed to send up three more this year.
After the launch, Seoul said it was suspending parts of a military agreement, reached in 2018 to reduce the risk of conflict, and announced it was resuming aerial surveillance along the Military Demarcation Line separating the uneasy neighbors.
In response, North Korea exited the pact entirely. The one-party state in January changed its constitution to label South Korea as the ""principal enemy"" and has been dismantling symbols of North-South cooperation.

Oscar-nominated Korean diaspora film follows 'lives we leave behind',"A Korean-Canadian director's debut feature film -- a quiet romance exploring time, longing and lost chances -- has arrived in South Korea for theatre release after garnering two Oscar nominations.
Ever since South Korea's ""Parasite"" became the first non-English language film to win a Best Picture Oscar in 2020, works by Korean diaspora filmmakers have witnessed a significant surge of global interest.
Celine Song's ""Past Lives"" comes alongside the critical success of other works featuring the Korean overseas experience, such as ""Minari"", ""Pachinko"" and Netflix's ""Beef"".
The film follows a Korean-American woman in New York who is visited by her childhood crush from Seoul more than 20 years after she abruptly left South Korea for North America.
It was a favourite at last year's Sundance, won best picture at this year's Independent Spirit Awards and has received two nominations for the upcoming Academy Awards: best picture and best original screenplay.
The project was inspired by Song's own experience -- drinking with her husband who does not speak Korean and her childhood friend who was visiting from South Korea in New York -- where she had to act as an interpreter for the gathering.
""As I was doing the interpretation, I also realized that I was interpreting two parts of my own story, my personal history itself and my identity,"" Song said at a press conference in Seoul.
Her film skillfully explores what it means to live in the realm of ""what ifs"", and one's complex relationship with a younger self that exists solely in the past and in places they no longer inhabit.
""We are not fantasy characters nor do we traverse multiple universes or parallel dimensions,"" Song said in an interview with AFP and others, when asked about the film's title.
""But because we pass through so much time and space, and because we age and we relocate, I believe that there are always lives that we end up leaving behind.""
- Time and closure -
""Past Lives"" is South Korean entertainment giant CJ ENM's first joint project with Hollywood's indie film studio A24, which counts films such as the Oscar-winning Korean-American tale ""Minari"" and absurdist immigrant comedy-drama ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" in its catalogue.
One-third of ""Past Lives"" was shot in South Korea, with the remaining portions filmed in the United States. Its distribution is being handled by A24 in North America and CJ in Asia.
CJ ENM -- which has backed film hits including ""Parasite"" and local blockbusters such as ""Ode to My Father"" -- said ""Past Lives"" is part of its strategy to diversify into the global market.
""It is difficult for us to compete in the United States with a movie that goes up against a Marvel series"" with huge budgets, Jerry Kyoungboum Ko, CJ ENM's head of film business, said.
The company's strength lies in its focus on Asia, and CJ ENM aims to leverage that by collaborating with up-and-coming talents from both domestic and international backgrounds who have fresh and authentic stories linked to the region, he added.
While diasporic tales have recently garnered considerable attention in Hollywood, stories of loss and places are ""no longer exclusive to immigrants themselves"" in the modern world, director Song said.
""When we screened this movie in Ireland, there was an Irish person who was moved to tears because it reminded him of his girlfriend whom he had left behind in Dublin, while he's currently residing in Glasgow.""
Song said her film also explores the concept of closure.
""In life, there are moments when we say goodbye to (things and people) in a proper manner. However, there are also instances where we neglect to do so because we just think it's insignificant,"" she said.
""We come to realize how fortunate it is to be able to say goodbyes properly, how much of a gift it is.""",2024-03-07T12:47:40Z,https://www.rawstory.com,Raw Story
South Korea probing possible data theft of consumers by Chinese e-commerce companies,"The announcement follows South Korea’s antitrust regulator, Fair Trade Commission (FTC), sending inspectors to the office of AliExpress’s South Korean unit last week to probe the platform’s consumer protection practices, according to Yonhap news agency
As South Korea’s use of Chinese e-commerce platforms, such as Alibaba’s AliExpress and Temu, has increased, the country’s personal data protection watchdog announced on Thursday that it is investigating the consumer data practices of major overseas shopping platforms.
Following concerns raised by a parliament audit last year regarding the handling of data by platforms like AliExpress and PDD Holdings’ international discount e-commerce platform Temu, the Personal Information Protection Commission said it has been looking into foreign e-commerce platforms since last month.

The commission stated in a statement that it is examining the suitability of their safety precautions, international transfers, and policies for processing personal information. If any laws in South Korea are broken, it will take action.
The announcement follows South Korea’s antitrust regulator, Fair Trade Commission (FTC), sending inspectors to the office of AliExpress’s South Korean unit last week to probe the platform’s consumer protection practices, according to Yonhap news agency.
The FTC, Alibaba and Temu did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
South Koreans’ e-commerce purchases from China including from platforms like AliExpress and Temu rose 121% on year in 2023 to 3.3 trillion won ($2.48 billion), taking up nearly half of its total overseas e-commerce purchases, according to Statistics Korea data.

AliExpress, which began services in South Korea in 2018, invested about 100 billion won in the country in 2023 to expand its footprint, Daishin Securities analyst Lee Jee-eun said.
Investors are watching whether it and other Chinese e-commerce platforms’ fast user growth in South Korea will affect established players such as Naver Shopping and Coupang, although faster shipping and easy returns of local firms may keep the influence of Chinese platforms’ price competitiveness at bay, Seoul-based analysts have said.

The message read: ""Is the love to you by your fans not enough? Why did you choose to betray the fans? Please apologise directly. Otherwise, you will see a decrease in album sales and empty concert seats.""
In a handwritten note posted from her Instagram account on Wednesday, Karina, whose real name is Yu Ji-min, wrote: ""I apologise for surprising you greatly"".
She added: ""I know very well how disappointed [my fans] who have supported me are and how upset you're thinking about the memories we shared together.""

K-pop agencies are reportedly keen to promote their stars as romantically obtainable, while in Japan many pop stars have ""no dating"" clauses in their contracts.
A decade ago it was normal for K-pop agencies to ban new stars from relationships or even having a mobile phone - and nowadays admissions of a relationship are still considered a scandal among fans.

‘Google Tensor G4 wordt efficiënter met koelen en accuduur’,"Er is best wat te doen rondom de nog niet aangekondigde Tensor G4-chipset van Google. Zo gaan er geruchten dat deze minder krachtig zou zijn dan de Tensor G3. Met een nieuw bericht uit Korea denken we iets meer te weten over de chipset.
Tensor G4-chip krijgt nieuwe methodes voor koelen
Volgens berichtgeving uit Korea kriijgt de Google Tensor G4-chipset een nieuwe pakketmethode, van niemand minder dan Samsung. Dit zou mogelijk kunnen helpen bij het efficiënt koelen van de smartphone en het verduurzamen van de accu.
Financial News citeert ‘industriebronnen’ die zeggen dat Google en Samsung samenwerken voor het produceren van de Tensor G4-chip. Dat de tech-merken samenwerken, was al bekend. Het lijkt er nu op dat de chipset echter de 4 nanometer-processen gaat gebruiken van Samsung, samen met de pakketmethode.
De Tensor G4 zou in dit geval de nieuwere FOWLP-methode gebruiken, ook wel Fan-out Wafer Level Packaging. Dit is een verpakkingsmethode voor geïntegreerde schakelingen in een chip. Er wordt minder hitte gegenereerd omdat er minder contact is tussen de kleine onderdeeltjes.
Met deze methode blijft de chip beter gekoeld en kan deze ook efficiënter alle taken uitvoeren. Dit is ook wat de berichtgeving uit Korea vertelt. De Tensor G3-chipset gebruikte al een variant van deze methode.
Wat we al weten over de Tensor G4
In eerdere berichtgeving werd al gezegd dat de Tensor G4 een minimale upgrade is in vergelijking met de huidige G3-chip. Mocht de nieuwe chipset een verbetering bieden op het gebied van hitte en efficiëntie, is dat goed nieuws.
Google gaat volgens geruchten voor het uitbrengen van de Tensor G5-chipset weg bij Samsung. Die chip komt waarschijnlijk in de Pixel 10-serie, die in 2025 moet uitkomen. Die chipset zou dan bij TSMC geproduceerd worden, dat bekend staat om accu-efficiëntie. Een paar voorbeelden: de chipsets van Qualcomm en MediaTek komen hier vandaan.
De Google Tensor G4-chip wordt naar verwachting in de Pixel 9-serie onthuld. Ook gaan er al geruchten dat we deze straks ook in de Google Pixel Fold 2 terug gaan zien.

Kim Jong Un calls for war preparations amid U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise,"1 of 2 | North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a military training base and ordered strengthened war preparation drills, state media reported Thursday, amid an ongoing U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise. Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, March 7 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited an army training base and called for intensifying drills to prepare for war, state-run media reported Thursday, as U.S. and South Korean forces conducted a large-scale joint military exercise. Kim was joined by high-ranking defense officials at the military base in the western region of the country, where he oversaw drills in an ""environment little different from actual war,"" Korean Central News Agency reported. Advertisement
""Stressing the need for the [Korean People's Army] to further intensify the training at present, [Kim] set forth the important tasks for intensifying the practical actual-war drills ensuring the victory in a war,"" KCNA said.
Images released by state media showed Kim, wearing a leather jacket, observing North Korean troops firing rifles and rocket launchers. One photo showed the North Korean leader holding an assault rifle in firing position.
The visit came as the United States and South Korea continued their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which kicked off on Monday.
The 11-day exercise has a focus on countering threats from the nuclear-armed North and includes 48 joint field drills, almost twice as many as last year.

In connection with Freedom Shield, on Thursday South Korean fighter jets staged a live-fire exercise over the Yellow Sea to boost readiness against North Korean cruise missile and artillery threats, the South's Air Force said in a press release.
North Korea regularly condemns the allies' joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills in the past as a pretext for its own missile tests. Freedom Shield is the first joint exercise since the North scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military accord meant to reduce tensions along the border, raising additional concerns over a provocative response from Pyongyang.
Earlier this week, North Korea's Defense Ministry condemned the Freedom Shield exercise as part of a ""military threat to a sovereign state"" and warned that Seoul and Washington will be ""made to pay a dear price.""
North Korea has not conducted a missile launch since Feb. 14, after starting off the year with a flurry of weapons tests and artillery fire near the inter-Korean maritime border.
Tensions remain at their highest point in years on the Korean Peninsula, however, with Kim labeling Seoul the ""principal enemy"" last month and publicly rejecting the long-held goal of reunification.
The United States and South Korea, meanwhile, have increased their military cooperation over the past several months, with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets such as aircraft carriers, a B-52 nuclear bomber and a nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the Korean Peninsula.",2024-03-07T09:45:25Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
La Corée du Sud examine la protection des données par les plateformes de commerce électronique telles qu'AliExpress et Temu,"L'organisme de surveillance de la protection des données personnelles de la Corée du Sud a déclaré jeudi qu'il examinait les pratiques en matière de données des consommateurs des principales plateformes d'achat à l'étranger, alors que l'utilisation par les Sud-Coréens des plateformes de commerce électronique chinoises telles qu'AliExpress et Temu d'Alibaba a fait un bond.
La Commission de protection des informations personnelles a déclaré qu'elle enquêtait sur les plateformes de commerce électronique étrangères depuis le mois dernier, après qu'un audit parlementaire ait soulevé l'année dernière des questions sur le traitement des données par des plateformes telles qu'AliExpress et Temu, la plateforme internationale de commerce électronique à prix réduits à laquelle PDD Holdings est confronté.
Elle vérifie l'adéquation de leurs politiques de traitement des informations personnelles, des transferts à l'étranger et des mesures de sécurité, et prendra des mesures en cas de violation de la loi sud-coréenne, a déclaré la commission dans un communiqué.
Cette annonce fait suite à l'envoi, la semaine dernière, par la Fair Trade Commission (FTC), l'autorité de régulation antitrust sud-coréenne, d'inspecteurs dans les bureaux de l'unité sud-coréenne d'AliExpress afin d'examiner les pratiques de la plateforme en matière de protection des consommateurs, selon l'agence de presse Yonhap.
La FTC, Alibaba et Temu n'ont pas répondu immédiatement aux demandes de commentaires.
Les achats de commerce électronique des Sud-Coréens en Chine, y compris sur des plateformes comme AliExpress et Temu, ont augmenté de 121 % en 2023 pour atteindre 3,3 billions de wons (2,48 milliards de dollars), ce qui représente près de la moitié du total des achats de commerce électronique à l'étranger, selon les données de Statistics Korea.
AliExpress, qui a commencé à offrir des services en Corée du Sud en 2018, a investi environ 100 milliards de wons dans le pays en 2023 pour étendre son empreinte, a déclaré l'analyste Lee Jee-eun de Daishin Securities.
Les investisseurs surveillent si sa croissance rapide des utilisateurs en Corée du Sud, ainsi que celle d'autres plateformes de commerce électronique chinoises, affectera les acteurs établis tels que Naver Shopping et Coupang, bien que l'expédition plus rapide et les retours faciles des entreprises locales puissent maintenir à distance l'influence de la compétitivité des prix des plateformes chinoises, ont déclaré des analystes basés à Séoul.

Kim Jong Un inspects North Korean troops and orders heightened war preparations,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for greater war fighting capabilities against the United States and South Korea, state media reported Thursday, after his defense ministry vowed to respond to the ongoing South Korean-U.S. military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal.
During a visit to a western operational training base on Wednesday, Kim said the military must “steadily intensify the actual war drills aimed at rapidly improving its combat capabilities for perfect war preparedness,” the official Korean Central News Agency said.
Kim said the heightened readiness is required to “contain the constant threat of the enemies with overwhelming force,” KCNA said.
It said Kim guided maneuvers of military units at the site but didn’t elaborate. State media photos showed Kim wearing a black leather jacket and standing in position to shoot a rifle and standing near soldiers who were lying on the ground and aiming their rifles.
Kim has previously made similar calls for a stronger military numerous times.
But his latest demand came two days after North Korea’s Defense Ministry threatened to conduct unspecified ”responsible military activities” because South Korean-U.S. military drills were allegedly getting more undisguised in their attempt for invading the North.
The South Korean and U.S. militaries began their annual computer-simulated command post training and a variety of field exercises on Monday for an 11-day run.

"North Korea's Kim Jong Un calls for heightened war preparations against US, South Korea","Follow us on Image Source : REUTERS North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects field training of troops at a major military operations base.
Pyongyang: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for greater war-fighting capabilities against the United States and South Korea, according to state media on Thursday, as the defence ministry vowed to respond to ongoing military drills between its two major rivals, which Pyongyang views as an invasion rehearsal. North Korea has reacted to previous South Korean-US military exercises with missile and other weapons tests.
During a visit to a Western operational training base on Wednesday, Kim said the military must “steadily intensify the actual war drills aimed at rapidly improving its combat capabilities for perfect war preparedness,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. Kim guided maneuvers of military units at the site and said the heightened readiness is required to “contain the constant threat of the enemies with overwhelming force"".
The North Korean leader also inspected the field training of troops at the major military operations base and said the military must ""dynamically usher in a new heyday of intensifying the war preparations in line with the requirements of the prevailing situation"", according to KCNA.
US-South Korean military drills
His latest demand came two days after North Korea's Defense Ministry threatened to conduct unspecified ”responsible military activities” because South Korean-US military drills were allegedly getting more undisguised in their attempt to invade the North. The two allies began their annual computer-simulated command post training and a variety of field exercises on Monday for an 11-day run.
This year's drills were to involve 48 field exercises, twice the number conducted last year. The two countries have said their drills are defensive in nature as North Korea continues to accelerate his weapons development and make provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the United States and its Asian allies. North Korea has tested multiple long-range cruise missiles and a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile in January.
Tensions in the Korean Peninsula
In 2024, North Korea performed six rounds of missile tests. The US and South Korean forces, along with Japan, responded by expanding their training exercises. Animosities on the Korean Peninsula remain high in the wake of North Korea's barrage of missile tests since 2022.
Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons. North Korea is expected to further raise tensions with more provocative weapons tests as both the US and South Korea go for elections.
South Korean experts and officials say Kim's weapons drive has put further strain on a broken economy, decimated by decades of mismanagement and US-led sanctions over his nuclear ambitions. Kim has declared a departure from the long-standing goal of peaceful unification with South Korea, further instructing a revision of the North's constitution to designate the South as its most hostile foreign adversary.
While North Korean cruise missile activities aren't directly banned under UN sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan. They are designed to be harder to detect by radar, and North Korea claims they are nuclear-capable and their range is up to 2,000 km, a distance that would include US military bases in Japan.

"North Korean hackers steal South Korean chip equipment makers’ designs, says Seoul’s spy agency","South Korea’s National Intelligence Service is claiming that North Korean hackers have hacked into some of the biggest chip manufacturing equipment maker.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service is claiming that North Korean hackers have hacked into some of the biggest chip manufacturing equipment maker. The hackers have also stolen their designs. North Korea has been trying to develop their own chips for their missiles and weapons
North Korean hackers have broken into South Korean chip equipment makers, according to South Korea’s spy agency. This comes after South Korea’s NIS or the National Intelligence Service has been claiming for years that Pyongyang is trying to make their own semiconductors for its weapons programmes.
The revelation of the hack comes a month after President Yoon Suk Yeol warned North Korea may stage provocations such as cyberattacks to interfere with upcoming elections.

Last year, North Korea hacked into the emails of an aide to President Yoon.
“We believe that North Korea might possibly be preparing to produce its own semiconductors in the face of difficulties in procuring them due to sanctions,” the NIS said in a statement.
It added that Pyongyang’s efforts could be driven by the need to have chips for its weapons programmes, including satellites and missiles.
The NIS believes North Korea penetrated the servers of two chip equipment companies in December and February, stealing product designs and photographs of their facilities.
It also warned other companies in the chipmaking industry to take precautions against cyber attacks.
However, the spy agency did not name the firms affected nor suggest that North Korea was able to obtain anything of value.

The NIS said South Korea’s companies had been a key target of North Korean hackers since late last year.
It believes hackers employed a technique called “living off the land,” which minimises malicious codes and uses existing, legitimate tools installed within servers, making it difficult to detect with security software.
Last month, President Yoon’s office said that the breach of an aide’s email account was caused by a violation of security regulations and that its official system had not been hacked.

Pyongyang has always denied involvement in cyber-crimes but Seoul has blamed North Korean hackers for stealing large sums of money, often in cryptocurrency, to fund the regime and its nuclear weapons programme.
North Korea is estimated to have stolen as much as $3bn since 2016.
It is also thought to carry out hacks with the purpose of stealing state secrets, including details of advanced weapons technology.

India-Japan-South Korea trilateral: Time to chart new paths in the Indo-Pacific,"The three nations must take the opportunity to fortify their partnership to safeguard their interests and uphold the international rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific
In 2011 an idea was germinated in New Delhi over a dinner reception, and that idea led to the formation of a trilateral between India, South Korea, and Japan. After its conceptualisation, the first meeting was hosted by India in June 2012, followed by the second in November 2013 in Japan. However, that effort was unable to fructify as expected. At its first attempt , the trilateral could not succeed due to the absence of some important elements such as strategic alignment and strong convergence between the three partners. In addition, there was a hesitation to only focus on ‘softer, [and] noncontroversial issues.’ All these issues led to its failure. However, that effort gave some critical insights that need to be incorporated to build a more successful trilateral in its second birth.

As the India, South Korea and Japan trilateral re-emerges, it is important to look at it from a new perspective. The contemporary time demands the addition of new strategic vocabulary and a focus on critical issues and themes in the trilateral. The renewed effort to resuscitate the trilateral must take note of the changing regional environment, from Asia-Pacific to Indo-Pacific, reflecting the importance of rules-based international order, essential to safeguard maritime trade and security.
We have identified three major areas where the trilateral can focus initially, these are Indo-Pacific Maritime security, Development cooperation, and Critical and Emerging Technology: semiconductors, EVs and critical minerals.
Re-emergence of India-South Korea-Japan trilateral: Finding new convergences
Today, the ‘free and open’ Indo-Pacific needs more minilateralism efforts from regional countries. In strengthening minilateralism, trilateral has been crucial in the Indo-Pacific, providing like-minded countries with a platform to convene on shared concerns and objectives. Today, India, Japan, and South Korea are more comfortable with the Indo-Pacific concept and have converging interests between India’s Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision, South Korea’s Indo-Pacific Strategy , and Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific Vision . This article is an attempt again to nudge the trilateral cooperation between the three countries, particularly before External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visits South Korea and Japan in his East Asia tour. The continuity in his visit from South Korea to Japan highlights a common thread driving the increasing need to have a trilateral today. This is easier today when all three countries are engaged in many trilaterals with each other, India-Japan-US, India-Japan-Australia, India-US-South Korea, and US-Japan-ROK.

The first important area that demands cooperation is maritime regional security. This comes at a time when the entire Indo-Pacific region is experiencing turbulence in the maritime domain, from the western Indian Ocean to the South China Sea (SCS), conflict is affecting maritime trade and energy security. The concerns regarding the Red Sea crisis have risen in Japan, South Korea, and India. In this India has taken the responsibility to provide security to vessels moving from the western Indian Ocean towards East Asia in line with its SAGAR vision. Japan and South Korea can utilise this opportunity to collaborate on Maritime security focusing on the Indo-Pacific region, particularly the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and SCS, where all three have converging interests.

India can take the leadership role in the IOR. Defence cooperation through coordinated maritime patrol, anti-piracy operations, and strengthening maritime domain awareness are some areas where the three can work together. Japan and South Korea can leverage trilateral relations with India to bolster maritime security initiatives in the Indian Ocean region and Southeast Asia. Japan’s Official Security Assistance programme, India’s developmental aid, and South Korea’s military cooperation with regional countries can be synchronised to achieve two aims, defence modernisation and developing capabilities (sharing best practices, joint exercises, and military collaboration). For Instance, India , South Korea, and Japan are helping in building the Philippines’s maritime capabilities in a bilateral format to assist in improving its maritime capacity.

The second focus area is development cooperation, particularly on high-quality infrastructure and connectivity projects in South Asia. Japan is currently engaged in nine developmental projects amounting to $1.55 billion across sectors in the region. Similarly, South Korea is also looking to increase its ODA to India. These ODAs are utilised to build the infrastructure that is necessary for economic growth, such as roads, bridges, and airports. Japan and South Korea can coordinate ODA projects in India. Northeast India is one sub-region where the three can collaborate on projects, giving much impetus to easing connectivity with Southeast Asia, which converges with the interests of all three partners. The three can coordinate better on foreign ODA such as the railway project in the Philippines.

Further, South Korea and Japan can harmonise institutional working methods between JICA and KOICA to ease bureaucratic and budgetary systems in India and South Asia to fund ODA projects by creating a basket fund to be utilised for project implementation. This can be a coordinated approach rather than a joint approach, which will be more flexible. These projects can also be focused on imparting training skills that help in achieving the SDGs of low-income developing countries in the region.
The third area of cooperation is critical and emerging technology (CET). India is eyeing to expand its manufacturing capacity and is attracting South Korean and Japanese Tech conglomerates to invest in semiconductor supply chains, EVs, and Critical minerals. Many South Korean and Japanese companies are looking to diversify their new investments in the region and India is emerging as an attractive alternative in China plus one strategy. India with its incentives, market, economic growth potential, and human capital stands out among other options.
Trilateral on CET will enhance the tech partnership ensuring technical sovereignty in the region which currently remains elusive of any consensus. EVs and critical mineral supply chain cooperation is another vital area of cooperation that needs closer cooperation between countries as all three have an embedded interest in de-risking the supply chain from China for their economic security. The three countries can form their i-CET version to enhance collaboration in R&D, in line with the announcement of the India-South Korea-US CET informal dialogue last year.
The three nations must take the opportunity to fortify their partnership to safeguard their interests and uphold the international rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific. This is the appropriate time for India, Japan, and South Korea to bolster this trilateral cooperative mechanism, particularly after correcting the mistakes that it made in the past as mentioned above. The three avenues of collaboration—Indo-Pacific maritime security, development cooperation, and Critical and Emerging Technology: Semiconductors, EVs, and critical minerals, can be the focal points that can later be expanded to other sectors.

"BTS, Blackpink, Squid Game, kimchi … what’s the secret of South Korea’s world-conquering culture?","How does this sound for a leisurely day of cultural immersion? Ablutions completed, apply a moisturising face mask infused with snail secretion against an audio backdrop of girl group Blackpink. For lunch, a bowl of bibimbap and a Bong Joon-ho film. In the evening, binge-watch zombie series All of Us Are Dead over spicy yangnyeom chicken and a bottle of strawberry soju. All this without setting foot inside their country of origin.
Not even the fact that the all-conquering boyband BTS have been called up for military service can dampen the global appetite for all things South Korean. K-pop now regularly tops the US and UK charts. Three years after Squid Game became Netflix’s most-watched show ever, four years after Bong’s Parasite became the first non-English language film to win the best picture Oscar, with K-pop girl group Twice at No 1 on the US album chart, the Korean content juggernaut shows no sign of slowing down.
In fact, western studios are now talking of a Korean “gold rush”. Netflix recently announced $2.5bn in investment in South Korean projects over the next four years, led by a second season of Squid Game. Disney and Apple TV+ are also commissioning more South Korean shows. “Everybody wants a piece of Korean content,” one Disney executive recently told the Hollywood Reporter. “It’s been popular across Asia for 20 years [but] the fact that it can now travel globally – that’s something new.”
Even the BBC is getting in on the act. In February, CBBC and BBC iPlayer launched Gangnam Project – a coming-of-age “dramedy” looking at “what it takes to become a K-pop superstar”. The BBC’s head of commissioning and acquisitions for 7-12-year-olds, Sarah Muller, noted: “South Korea is the modern centre of the creative world.”

The country has come a long way in just a few decades. The 1988 Seoul Olympics marked its emergence from nearly 30 years of military rule, but even at the turn of the century, South Korea was primarily known abroad for its cars, consumer electronics and the ruthless dictatorship with which it shared a border. Now, the surging currents of Hallyu (the Korean wave) have cemented its credentials as a cultural superpower.
“The Korean wave is a newfound source of pride and confidence for South Koreans,” says Inkyu Kang, a professor of digital journalism at Penn State University. The phenomenon, he added, has developed in step with the country’s “remarkable” economic growth in the decades since the stalemate that ended the 1950-53 Korean war.
Some have framed South Korea’s cultural advance as a government-led mission. The Korean state has been instrumental in turning cultural identity into an exportable commodity since the presidency of Kim Dae-jung in the late 90s and early 00s – a thread that has run through successive administrations on the right and left of Korean politics.
But others see it as more of a fruitful public-private effort. “The global success of the Korean wave is naturally the result of private sector efforts, but the government indirectly supports its spread by creating a foundation for the private sector to unleash its creativity,” says a spokesperson for the Hallyu content cooperation division at South Korea’s ministry of culture, sports and tourism. “Consumers have come to focus on the competitiveness of the content itself rather than its nationality.”
The ministry acts as an umbrella organisation for bodies that shape promotional and creative policies, backed by trillions of won in government funding: the Korea Creative Content Agency, the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange and the Korea Film Council. And a new generation of creators has been nurtured through freeing up private enterprise with loans, tax breaks and investment in institutions, including the Korean Academy of Film Arts and Korea National University of Arts, along with the influential Busan International film festival.

The ever-expanding parameters of the K-genre now encompass not only the hardy perennials of pop music, TV and film, but also relative newcomers such as beauty, fashion, cuisine and literature.
Hordes of international tourists flock to Seoul’s Myeongdong neighbourhood to bulk-buy cosmetics from the Face Shop, Skin Food and other outlets whose products are now part of a global K-beauty market that will be worth $18.32bn in 2030, according to a recent report by Straits Research. “Thanks to the Korean history of employing natural, distinctive and harsh-free substances passed down over many years, Korean beauty products have considerably milder compositions,” the report said.
Korean cuisine is on a similarly dizzying trajectory. Its take on corn dogs – sausage snacks with a crispy coating and a satisfyingly gooey centre – have been among the most sought-after street foods in the US in recent years. UK supermarkets routinely stock jars of kimchi – South Korea’s spicy pickled staple with an international reputation for boosting gut health – while chefs add zing to their dishes with blobs of gochujang – fermented chilli paste – and drinkers are discovering why soju – a distilled liquor made from fermented grains – has long been the country’s favourite tipple.
This global output has reaped dividends for what is now Asia’s fifth-largest economy. Exports of South Korean cultural content reached a high of $12.4bn in 2021 – dwarfing earnings from home electronic appliances and electric vehicles. According to a study by the Hyundai Research Institute in 2019, BTS were thought to be worth about $3.67bn to the South Korean economy each year in exports, consumption and inbound tourism – the band’s single Dynamite going to No 1 in the US in 2020 is thought to have created almost 8,000 jobs.
Many content providers are small, independent startups that cover publishing, music, video games, broadcasting, films and animation, but they coexist and collaborate with the chaebol, huge family-run conglomerates (Lotte and Orix are two notable players) with traditionally close ties to senior politicians. Small and medium-sized firms also benefit from government largesse. Last year they received 790bn Korean won ($593m) to increase exports of Korean cultural content, according to the Yonhap news agency.

But viewing Hallyu as a national project hatched in government offices and boardrooms ignores the organic nature of Brand Korea. “It would be a mistake to view the Korean wave as a product of top-down, government-planned enterprise,” says John Lie, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of K-pop: Economic Innovation, Cultural Amnesia and Popular Music in Contemporary South Korea. “Once dramas and pop music caught on, the government was happy to support them through measures such as tax breaks and using the foreign ministry and South Korean embassies to promote pop culture, and then claim credit for it.”
While successive governments have been happy to associate themselves with Hallyu, South Korean artists thrive most when the state takes a back seat, says Kang, who mentions that the guiding principle of Kim Dae-jung’s mission in the 90s and 00s to turn culture into an industry was “support but do not interfere”. “It may sound cynical, but the best thing that the South Korean government has done is to leave creators alone,” he says.
Relations between the government and some of the country’s cultural flag bearers have not always been easy. “Funding has not always been distributed fairly and transparently,” says Kang, citing the revelation that between 2008 and 2017, the conservative administration blacklisted singers, actors, writers and film-makers over their perceived leftwing politics, depriving them of support and even pressing producers not to hire them. Targets included the Oscar-winner Bong, and Song Kang-ho, the lead actor in Parasite, as well as Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of Squid Game, and director Park Chan-wook, best known for the films Oldboy and The Handmaiden.
Hallyu has also, at times, revealed a darker side that raises questions about South Korean attitudes towards mental health, sexual assault and exploitation, especially of women. It has been rocked by a series of scandals and high-profile apparent suicides including, most recently, Lee Sun-kyun, best known for his role in Parasite. Revelations that K-pop stars had secretly filmed themselves having sex with women without their consent brought South Korea’s molka spycam epidemic into the K-pop realm, and was seized upon as evidence of rampant misogyny at the heart of the country’s entertainment industry.

Ironically perhaps, K-pop is now an international operation. “K-pop employs an extensive global division of labour, from Swedish composers and Italian costume designers to American choreographers,” says Lie. The industry has long taken recognisable international genres – such as R&B and hip-hop – and infused them with “Korean characteristics”, from the uniformly androgynous vibes given off by boyband members to the avoidance of “controversial” themes of sex and violence.
K-pop’s most successful acts have long performed versions of the same song in different languages depending on the target market – an approach that last year helped Jungkook, of BTS, soar to the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK singles chart with his debut solo single, Seven. Multilingual performers have been joined by a slew of K-pop bands who aren’t Korean at all. Giant Korean boyband NCT now includes sub-branches NCT Wish, comprising six Japanese members, and WayV, whose members are Chinese and Thai. Vcha, meanwhile, are an American girl group based in Los Angeles.

The Korean wave shows no signs of breaking yet. There is even growing international interest in learning the language. Demand for classes last year prompted the government to expand the number of schools belonging to the King Sejong Institute, a government-sponsored Korean language education body, from 244 to 270, as enrolment in Korean language courses overseas – from the Duolingo hobbyists to modern languages undergraduates – has risen.
“I anticipate that the next ‘big thing’ will be literature,” says Kang. “Korea’s remarkable storytelling prowess has been shown through film, TV series and webtoons, yet despite its increasing visibility, Korean literature has yet to receive its due recognition.
Critical praise for Min Jin Lee’s 2017 debut novel, Pachinko, based on her family history, led to a screen version on Apple TV+. “The profound experiences and resilience of the Korean people, who have endured harsh challenges such as colonialism, division, war, destitution and dictatorship – all in the same century – are encapsulated in the depth and richness of their literature,” says Kang. “Koreans have lots of gripping stories to share with the world.”",2024-03-06T10:00:15Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
US-Led War Games Draw Warning From North Korea,"The 11-day Freedom Shield exercise, scheduled to run from March 4-14, will focus on multi-area and multi-domain joint operations, as well as the ""neutralization of North Korea's nuclear threat,"" defense officials in the South announced at the start of the week.
Kim Jong Un's regime denounced the U.S.-led drills ""for getting more undisguised in their military threat to a sovereign state and attempt for invading it,"" according to a March 4 statement by North Korea's Defense Ministry, carried on Tuesday by the official Korean Central News Agency.
""The U.S. and the ROK will be made to pay a dear price for their false choice while realizing that it causes their security uneasiness at a serious level every moment,"" the statement said, referring to the Republic of Korea, the South's official name.
Inter-Korean relations have nose-dived to a dangerous new low amid Kim's record number of missile tests and his marked shift in foreign policy away from reconciliation with the South, a U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty ally for seven decades.
In January, the 40-year-old supreme leader declared South Korea the North's ""principal enemy.""
Since last fall, North and South Korea also have been competing in space, with each side placing their own spy satellite in orbit with help from Russia and the U.S., respectively.
Pyongyang said the allied war games would increase the unpredictability of the Korean War armistice.
""The frantic war drills by the ROK puppets and vassal forces led by the U.S. make a clear contrast with the reality of the DPRK mobilizing large-scale military forces into economic construction for the promotion of the people's well-being, confirm again the source of regional instability and more clearly show who is the arch criminal threatening the mankind with nukes,"" its Defense Ministry said, referring to the country's full name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
During the same exercise one year ago, North Korea launched long- and short-range missiles in what it described as defensive measures.

Freedom Shield brings together the South Korean armed forces, U.S. Force Korea and the United Nations Command, the multinational coalition that has backed the South since the Korean War of the early 1950s.
The specialist Air and Space Forces Magazine said on Tuesday that U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 ""Warthogs,"" and fifth-generation F-35 Lightning IIs were expected to take part.
The U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps separately announced their participation in the drills this week.
""Training with the ROK Army allows for seamless coordination and combined operations, enhancing Eighth Army's overall defense capabilities,"" the U.S.'s South Korea-based Eighth Army said.
""The combined training exercises and shared intelligence contribute to a high level of interoperability, enabling Eighth Army to respond swiftly and effectively to any threat,"" it said.
At a Washington think tank on Tuesday, a senior U.S. official said Pyongyang's foreign policy shift had resulted in greater North Korean cooperation with Russia and China, with potentially serious consequences for security in the region.
Jung Pak, the top U.S. official for North Korea affairs at the State Department, told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that Kim's regime had become a ""willing supplier"" of arms to Moscow.
Pyongyang has shipped ""dozens of ballistic missiles and thousands of containers of ammunition to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine,"" she said.
Pyongyang and Moscow did not return multiple requests seeking comment.
Both governments deny trading arms—a violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions passed with Russia's support.
Pak added: ""At this point, we don't assess that Kim Jong Un has changed his primary goal—the preservation of his regime—or the means by which he hopes to achieve this—the international acceptance of the DPRK as a nuclear weapons power.""
""What has changed is that Kim seems to have decided he cannot achieve his primary goals through negotiations with the United States or the Republic of Korea. He's viewing the world through a new Cold War lens, in which the DPRK can benefit from aligning more closely with Russia and the PRC,"" she said.",2024-03-06T09:57:16Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
South Korea's president vows not to tolerate walkouts by junior doctors,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol speaks during a cabinet meeting at the government complex in Sejong, South Korea, Wednesday, March 6, 2024. The prolonged walkouts by junior doctors won't be tolerated, South Korea’s president said Wednesday, calling them ""an illegal collective action"" that threatens public health and shakes the country’s governing systems.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president vowed Wednesday not to tolerate the prolonged walkouts by thousands of junior doctors, calling them “an illegal collective action” that threatens public health and shakes the country’s governing systems.
President Yoon Suk Yeol’s government was in the process of suspending the licenses of about 9,000 medical interns and residents over their joint walkouts that have impacted hospitals' capacity to provide care.
The doctors-in-training have been on strike for more than two weeks to protest a government push to admit thousands more new students to medical schools in coming years. Officials say the enrollment plan is essential to bracing for the country's rapidly aging population, but doctors say such an abrupt, steep increase in the number of students would eventually result in undermining the overall medical service.

“The collective action by the doctors is an act that betrays their responsibilities and shakes the basis of the liberalism and constitutionalism,” Yoon said in televised remarks at the start of a Cabinet meeting. “An illegal action that infringes upon the people’s right to life will be never be tolerated.”
Yoon’s government had repeatedly urged the striking doctors to return to work or face indictments and minimum three-month license suspensions. But most of the strikers missed a government-set Feb. 29 deadline for their return.
By South Korea’s medical law, doctors who defy orders to restart work can be punished by up to three years in prison or a 30-million-won (roughly $22,500) fine, as well as a up to one year’s suspension of their medical licenses. Those who receive prison sentences can be deprived of their licenses.

Starting from Monday, the Health Ministry began the administrative steps to suspend the strikers’ licenses: dispatching officials to hospitals to formally confirm their absences and sending notices to the strikers about their planned suspensions. The ministry was required to give them opportunities to respond before their suspensions take effect.
Observers say the ministry will likely end up suspending strike leaders, not the whole group of the 9,000 doctors who walked off the job — a daunting administrative task that would likely take weeks or longer.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told reporters Tuesday that the government plans to file complaints against strike leaders to get them to face police investigations as well. But he said officials haven’t determined when they would do so and against whom.
The striking residents and interns represent only about 6.5% of the country's 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30%-40% of the total doctors and had played the role of assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training. Their walkouts have subsequently caused hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals and burdened South Korea's medical service.

The public is largely opposed to the doctors' strikes, and surveys show Yoon's approval ratings rising over his push for the medical school enrollment plan. One poll showed that a majority of South Koreans backed the enrollment plan.
Heath officials have said the country's handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable, with public hospitals extending working hours and military hospitals opening emergency rooms. But if senior doctors joined the walkouts, South Korea's medical service would suffer a major blow.
The Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, has expressed its support for the striking junior doctors, but hasn't decided whether to take part in the walkouts.
Police were investigating allegations that five senior KMA officials incited and abetted the junior doctors' walkouts, and said they summoned one of them Wednesday.",2024-03-06T09:26:50Z,https://www.bigrapidsnews.com,The Pioneer

Mint Explainer: What’s on Jaishankar’s agenda in South Korea and Japan?,"On Tuesday, India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar will leave for a four-day visit to South Korea and Japan, where he is expected to discuss cooperation on advanced technologies, especially semiconductors, besides a host of other issues. Mint breaks down his agenda.
What's on the cards?
Jaishankar will first travel to Seoul, where he is expected to chair the 10th India-Korea Joint Commission Meeting with the new South Korean foreign minister Cho Tae-yul. At previous meetings, the two countries have focused on supply-chain security and collaborating on advanced technologies. Last August, India’s deputy national security adviser Vikram Misri visited South Korea to discuss critical and emerging technologies. New Delhi and Seoul have also set up a trilateral dialogue with the US on critical tech, led by the National Security Councils of the three countries.
Jaishankar will then travel on to Japan on Wednesday, where he will meet foreign minister Yoko Komikawa. According to India’s foreign ministry, the two will discuss defence, digital technologies, semiconductors, clean energy and high-speed rail, among other things.
What are the other issues on the agenda?
Discussions on Indo-Pacific issues and China are also expected during the visit. While Japan is a member of the Quad and has spoken about its concerns regarding China, South Korea has been more reticent. Seoul has attempted a more balanced policy as it tries to find a path between China and the United States.
Trade and investment will also be a likely topic of conversation with both Tokyo and Seoul. While Japan has announced targets for large investments into India, Seoul’s investment in India remains relatively muted.
What are the issues in bilateral ties?
Experts have said that Seoul and New Delhi have often found it hard to prioritise the other. India’s focus in East Asia has typically been on China and Japan, while South Korea’s recent efforts to diversify its foreign partners, such as through the New Southern Policy, have focussed on Southeast Asian countries rather than India. India has also raised concerns that its 2009 free trade agreement with South Korea is unbalanced in Seoul’s favour. Meanwhile, New Delhi and Tokyo have seen fairly anaemic growth in bilateral trade.
What are the key strategic issues?

PODGORICA – An appeals court in Montenegro has overturned a recent ruling that a cryptocurrency mogul, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, should be extradited to the United States to face fraud charges rather than to his native South Korea, the court said Tuesday.
Kwon, 32, was arrested nearly a year ago in Montenegro on an international arrest warrant in connection with a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world. Both South Korea and the U.S. have requested Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro.

Last month, the High Court in Montenegro decided to hand over Kwon to the U.S. But the Court of Appeals annulled the decision and ordered the lower court to repeat the process. The Appeals Court in a statement cited procedural issues over who was the first to file a request, the U.S. or South Korea.
It wasn't immediately clear when the final decision could be made.
Kwon, known as “the cryptocurrency king,” is wanted by the U.S., where he was charged with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York. South Korean prosecutors have also sought his extradition.
Kwon and another South Korean were arrested at Montenegro’s Podgorica Airport on March 23, while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform were wanted because of allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022.
TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.

SESAC Chooses KOSCAP to Represent Its Repertoire in Korea,"SESAC Music Group today (March 5) announced a deal with the Korean Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (KOSCAP) that calls for KOSCAP to represent SESAC’s repertoire in Korea and for SESAC-owned Audiam to administer KOSCAP’s publishing rights in the U.S.
The deal makes SESAC one of the first big collective management organizations (CMOs) to move its rights out of the established Korea Music Copyright Association (KOMCA) to KOSCAP, a competitor that the government approved in 2014 to increase competition in the market. KOSCAP will represent SESAC’s online and offline performing rights in Korea, and the catalog of the Harry Fox Agency, the SESAC Music Group’s mechanical rights entity, will follow next year.
The Audiam deal calls for that company, which the SESAC Music Group bought in 2021, to collect performing, mechanical and other audiovisual rights in the U.S. on behalf of KOSCAP.
Trending on Billboard
Charles Park
Although this might seem like just another deal in the alphabet soup world of collective rights management, it highlights the growing competition among CMOs – and how that is leading to different kinds of international deals. In October, SESAC made a deal to have its offline performing rights in Italy managed by Soundreef, a private company just over a decade old, instead of the traditional society Italian collecting society, SIAE.
“Why did we switch?” Alex Wolf, president of international of the SESAC Music Group, told Billboard about the KOSCAP deal. “We’re convinced about the competence and the responsiveness of the management and we’re convinced that we will increase our revenues. This is a bet on the future.”
Just a decade ago, only a few markets had competition among CMOs, which didn’t compete with one another across borders. Since 2014, though, when the European Union passed the Directive on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing, European societies have had to compete for online rights in the EU, and many other countries have opened up as well. This has led to competition among established organizations, as well as new companies like Soundreef – both to represent writers and publishers and to make deals with foreign CMOs.
“It’s a great honor to partner with SESAC, a global leader with a world-class catalog and one of the premier Performing Rights Management organizations in the world, along with Audiam’s innovative technology to administer our catalog in the US,” KOSCAP COO Charles Park said in the press release announcing the deal.",2024-03-05T14:00:31Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Seoul accuses North Korea for hacking South Korea chip equipment makers,"South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) reports North Korea’s breach into South Korean chip equipment makers.
The NIS believes North Korea hacked into the emails of an aide to President Yoon Suk Yeol last year.
The breach of an aide’s email account resulted from a violation of security regulations.

South Korea’s spy agency has reported that North Korean hackers broke into South Korean chip equipment makers. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) claims that Pyongyang is attempting to produce semiconductors for its weapons programs.
A month after President Yoon Suk Yeol warned that North Korea might stage provocations such as cyber-attacks to interfere with upcoming elections, reports emerged that North Korea hacked into the emails of an aide to President Yoon last year.
“We believe that North Korea might be preparing to produce its semiconductors in the face of difficulties in procuring them due to sanctions,” the NIS said in a statement.
The NIS added that Pyongyang’s efforts could be driven by the need to acquire chips for its weapons programs, including satellites and missiles.
The NIS believes North Korea penetrated the servers of two chip equipment companies in December and February, stealing product designs and photographs of their facilities.
It also cautioned other companies in the chip-making industry to take precautions against cyber-attacks. However, the spy agency did not name the affected firms or suggest that North Korea was able to obtain anything of value.

The NIS stated that North Korean hackers had targeted South Korea’s companies as a key focus since late last year. It believes hackers utilized a technique called “living off the land,” which minimizes malicious codes and utilizes existing, legitimate tools installed within servers, making it challenging to detect with security software.
Last month, President Yoon’s office acknowledged that the breach of an aide’s email account resulted from a violation of security regulations and clarified that its official system had not been hacked.
Seoul has blamed North Korean hackers for stealing large sums of money, often in cryptocurrency, to fund the regime and its nuclear weapons program, although Pyongyang has always denied involvement in cyber crimes. Estimates suggest that North Korea has stolen as much as $3 billion (£2.36 billion) since 2016.
Additionally, experts believe it carries out hacks to steal state secrets, including details of advanced weapons technology. The country, subject to extreme international sanctions, is increasingly becoming more sophisticated in the way it carries out cyber-attacks.

President Yoon is lauded in West for embracing Japan − in South Korea it fits a conservative agenda that is proving less popular,"When South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol broke out into an impromptu performance of the song “American Pie” at a gala White House dinner in 2023, it was more than just a musical interlude. It was symbolic of how on the big Indo-Pacific issues of the day, Washington and Seoul are singing from the same songbook.
But so, too, is Japan. And for South Korea’s karaoke-loving leader, that means humming a different tune to predecessors on the international stage – and risking hitting a sour note back at home.
Yoon, who took office in May 2022, has embraced closer ties with Japan, South Korea’s former colonizer, as part of an alignment with U.S.-led security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. It entails a more demanding stance toward North Korea’s denuclearization and a watchful eye on China and its increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.
The approach culminated in a historic Camp David summit in 2023 aimed at solidifying relations between South Korea and Japan.
Such rapprochement with Japan has won Yoon plaudits in the U.S.
But it has done nothing to improve his popularity back home. In South Korea there is growing disapproval of Yoon’s leadership. Critics point to an illiberal streak in his rhetoric and policies, which has included attacks on his critics and the media. It has, they contend, contributed to a worrying trend of democratic erosion in Korea. Yoon’s poll ratings are sinking at a time when his conservative party seeks control of parliament in elections slated for April 10, 2024.
As scholars who study democratization and authoritarian politics and modern Korea, we are watching as these concerns grow in the run-up to the parliamentary elections. That vote will prove a test of the popular support for Yoon, his domestic agenda and his vision for South Korea’s more outward-looking international role.
Japan is ‘now our partner’
Yoon struck a raw nerve in an Aug. 15, 2023, speech celebrating National Liberation Day in Korea, in which he affirmed the country’s partnership with neighboring Japan. He said the country’s former colonial occupier is “now our partner, sharing universal values and pursuing common interests,” and emphasized that “as security and economic partners, Korea and Japan will cooperate with a forward-looking approach, contributing to global peace and prosperity.”
His remarks were met with public outrage, especially given their timing: National Liberation Day commemorates Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule, which lasted from 1910 to 1945.
The Japanese occupation was brutal, simultaneously exploiting Korean women – as evident in the use of so-called “comfort women,” or military sexual slaves – and treating Koreans generally as second-class citizens, all the while pushing obligatory assimilation into Japanese civilization on the occupied population.
Attempts by the Japanese colonial regime at erasing a separate Korean identity and culture – this included banning the teaching of the Korean language and coercing Koreans to adopt Japanese names, along with the violent suppression of independence movements – left deep scars on the collective Korean psyche.
For many Koreans, watching their country join Japan in a trilateral partnership with the U.S. is too much to accept.
Emergence of pro-Japan voices
Yoon and his conservative administration’s foreign policy goals are based not on nationalism but on what has been described as “a value-based alliance” with Washington. This stance is at odds with the nationalist focus often seen in the right-wing politics of other countries.
Indeed, in South Korea it is the political left that increasingly identifies with a form of nationalism. Meanwhile, the “New Right” in South Korea has correspondingly embraced an anti-nationalist stance, specifically attacking anti-Japanese sentiment.
Since the early 2000s, Korean conservatives have increasingly distanced themselves from nationalism, particularly of the anti-Japanese variety. If, as theorists such as Ernest Gellner have argued, modern nationalism is based on the presumed unity of state and nation, political developments in Korea since 1980 have destabilized this relationship.
After the bloodshed of the Gwangju Massacre in 1980, during which the state killed hundreds of its own citizens, leftist nationalists argued that the South Korean state was neither the representative or defender of the Korean nation.
Rather, they saw the South Korean state’s inheritance of institutions and personnel from the Japanese colonial government, alongside the hegemonic presence of the United States in Korea – characterized as “neocolonial” by some – as diluting the state’s nationalist credentials.
In contrast, conservatives defended the South Korean authoritarian state’s legitimacy and its legacies. They argued that authoritarian rule was responsible for the rapid economic growth that allowed South Koreans to live in prosperity.
As part of their defense of Korea’s legacy and attack on a political left increasingly identified with nationalism, conservatives embraced an anti-nationalist stance, specifically attacking anti-Japanese rhetoric. This has involved downplaying the negative effects of Japan’s colonial rule in Korea between 1910 and 1945 and even rejecting the validity of Korean comfort women testimonies. One additional motivation for conservatives has been to justify the achievements of right-wing heroes such as former dictator Park Chung Hee. Park, who has been credited with jump-starting Korea’s economic growth, has been castigated by nationalists as a pro-Japanese collaborator, having been an officer in the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1940s.
Starting around the turn of the century, there has been a gradual increase in the frequency and intensity of pro-Japan voices. Far-right organizations, such as the Republic of Korea Mom’s Brigade, have since the 2010s organized rallies in defense of Japanese colonialism. More recently, far-right groups have systematically disrupted so-called Wednesday Demonstrations – a protest that has been continually held for over 30 years in front of the Japanese embassy in Korea to demand that Japan address the comfort women issue.
In a 2019 bestselling book, conservatives even attacked anti-Japanese nationalism as a form of “tribalism” on the left. It is in this context of the growing prominence of pro-Japan voices that Yoon, in a 2023 interview with The Washington Post, expressed that he “could not accept the notion that Japan must kneel because of what happened 100 years ago.”
Attacks on critics and fake news
Yoon embodies this reorientation of Korean conservative ideology and foreign policy that rejects nationalism in favor of closer relations with Japan, especially in the context of alignment with the U.S. against the threat of North Korea and China. The approach has seen Yoon embraced by American policymakers.
Yet his popularity at home has fallen from an approval rating of above 50% in mid-2022 to 29% at the beginning of February 2024, although it has since picked up a little.
At first glance, his foreign policy seems to support liberal and democratic values. However, in domestic matters there has been growing concern that his rhetoric and policies reflect an illiberal character.
Examples include labeling his opponents as “communists” and attacks on the media and “fake news.”
This is perhaps unsurprising; the nature of Korean conservatism is deeply rooted in authoritarianism.
The Biden administration is keen to present Yoon differently – as an ally, along with Japan, in the protection of Asia’s democracies. But this says more about a U.S. foreign policy that centers China as a threat than it does Yoon’s actual commitment to democratic freedoms.
To a South Korea audience, however, Yoon’s position on Japan only adds to general concern over his illiberal tendencies ahead of April’s vote – the first general parliamentary elections during Yoon’s tenure.",2024-03-05T13:00:00Z,https://theconversation.com,The Conversation UK
Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) live image confirms unchanged design,"Samsung‘s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) has bagged a couple more certifications on its way to launch. The upcoming mid-range tablet has been certified by SGS Fimko in Switzerland and Safety Korea in South Korea. The latter also published a live image of the device, showing an unchanged front design.
Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) bags more regulatory certifications
Samsung is preparing to launch the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite for the third time. Originally launched in 2020, the mid-range tablet was refreshed in 2022 with a newer chip and the latest version of Android at that time. The company is now readying a second refresh, likely with similar changes. While we wait for the release date of the 2024 version, the firm continues to obtain regulatory certifications for it.

Over the past few weeks, we have spotted the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) on the FCC (USA), UL (Denmark), BIS (India), and the Global Certification Forum databases. It has just popped up on the Safety Korea and SGS Fimko websites as well. Both agencies certified the Wi-Fi variant of the tablet with the model number SM-P620. The 4G version is SM-P625, while the 5G version (if exists) should be SM-P627.
The live photo shared by Safety Korea shows the device with an identical front design to the original Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. There are thick but symmetrical bezels around the screen, and we also see a single front-facing camera at the top. The tablet is around 245mm long and 155mm wide. The original model and its 2022 refresh both measure 244.5 x 154.3 x 7 mm in dimension.
The SGS Fimko listing also confirms an unchanged battery capacity and charging speed for the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024). We are talking about a 6,840 mAh battery (rated capacity) and 15W wired charging (9V/1.67A). The typical or advertised battery capacity should be 7,040mAh. While we have no complaints about the battery size, Samsung should have offered 25W charging here.
A price cut may be on the cards
The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) will run Android 14 out of the box and come with Samsung’s Exynos 1280 processor. It also gets Bluetooth 5.3, an upgrade from Bluetooth 5.0 on the 2020 and 2022 versions. The rest of the setup may remain unchanged. Rumors say Samsung will price the new tablet at €429 and above in Europe. Except for the base Wi-Fi variant, all other variants are rumored to cost less than the 2022 version. We expect an official word from Samsung soon.",2024-03-05T12:37:29Z,https://www.androidheadlines.com,Android Headlines
South Korea Methodists excommunicate pastor over gay rights,"South Korea's Methodist Church has excommunicated a pastor for advocating gay rights, according to a church verdict obtained Tuesday by AFP.
Nearly a quarter of South Korea's population of 51 million are Christian and the religious community holds significant political sway, with many evangelicals staunchly opposing gay rights.
Gay marriage is not recognized in South Korea, social pressure keeps many people from being open about their sexuality, and Seoul's annual Pride celebration attracts vicious Christian-led opposition.
More than a dozen attempts to pass broad anti-discrimination laws have failed over the past 16 years in the face of strong opposition from conservative churches and civic groups who say the law will pave the way for legalization of gay marriage.
Globally, many religious groups have taken steps to embrace LGBTQI rights, with the Vatican recently approving Catholic blessings for same-sex couples.
But on Monday South Korea's Methodist Church upheld a lower church ruling to excommunicate pastor Lee Dong-hwan for having engaged in activities in support of gay rights, the verdict showed.
""The church doctrine stipulates acts of agreeing or sympathizing with homosexuality amount to rules violations,"" the church said in a verdict.
Reverend Lee had attended Seoul gay pride events, and also held blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples.
""Participating in and officiating a blessing ceremony to bless sexual minorities by scattering flower petals, performing a performance waving a large rainbow flag in the square in front of Seoul City Hall, proposing a blessing ceremony for homosexuals... are all acts of approval or agreement with homosexuality"" the verdict said.
The verdict is final within the church, and Reverend Lee has no way to contest it.
The 43-year-old pastor told AFP that the church's decision was ""shameful"".
""Excommunicating a pastor for blessing sexual minorities will go down in history of Protestantism as dark history that will only invite laughter later,"" Lee told AFP.
He said he was considering bring the case to a civil court.

Korean doctors face license suspensions as Seoul moves to prosecute strike leaders,"SEOUL, South Korea — Thousands of striking junior doctors in South Korea faced proceedings to suspend their medical licenses Tuesday, as authorities are pushing for police investigations targeting leaders of the walkouts that have disrupted hospital operations.
Nearly 9,000 of South Korea’s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been refusing to work for the last two weeks to protest a government plan to enroll thousands more students in the country’s medical schools in coming years. The government ordered them to return to work by Feb. 29, citing a threat to public health, but most have defied threats of license suspensions and prosecutions.
“For those who lead the walkouts, we are thinking we’ll file complaints with police,” Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing. “But I tell you that we haven’t determined exactly when we would do so and against whom.”
On Monday, the Health Ministry sent officials to hospitals to confirm the absences of the striking doctors to begin administrative steps to suspend their licenses. So far, the government has formally confirmed the absences of more than 7,000 strikers, and on Tuesday, officials were to continue on-site inspections of hospitals and begin sending notices to some strikers about license suspension proceedings, Park said.
Park said the striking doctors’ licenses would be suspended for at least three months, and doctors are to be given opportunities to respond before suspensions take effect.
“The trainee doctors have left their patients defenseless. They’ve even left emergency rooms and intensive care units,” Park said. “We can’t tolerate these irresponsible acts. They have betrayed their professional and ethical responsibilities and neglected their legal duties.”
Under South Korea’s medical law, doctors who defy orders to resume work can be punished with three years in prison or a 30 million won (roughly $22,500) fine, as well as an up to one-year suspension of their medical licenses. Those who receive prison sentences can lose their licenses.
Strike leaders
Observers say the government will likely end up punishing only strike leaders, not all of the thousands of striking doctors. They say it would take a few months to complete the administrative steps to suspend the licenses of all the 9,000 striking doctors.
At the heart of the dispute is a government plan to raise the country’s medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current 3,058. Officials said South Korea must add more doctors to deal with a fast-aging population. But many doctors say universities aren’t ready to deal with that abrupt increase in the number of students and that the country’s overall medical service would be eventually hurt. The striking junior doctors are a small fraction of the country’s 140,000 doctors, but they account for 30-40 percent of the total doctors at some major hospitals, where they assist senior doctors while training.
Many senior doctors support the junior doctors but haven’t joined their walkouts.
South Korean police said they are investigating five senior members of the Korea Medical Association, after the Health Ministry filed complaints against them for allegedly inciting and abetting the junior doctors’ walkouts. / AP",2024-03-05T11:45:20Z,https://www.sunstar.com.ph,SunStar Philippines
South Korean chipmaking giants reportedly hacked by North Korea,"South Korean chip manufacturers have apparently been hacked by North Korea in a bid to boost their weapons manufacturing, the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) has claimed.
According to NIS, the North Korean hackers managed to break into the servers of two semiconductor manufacturers and potentially stole sensitive information.
South Korea has legislative elections coming up in April 2024, and President Yoon Suk Yeol last month said that North Korea could increase the number of cyber attacks to interfere with the elections.
Sanctions hitting North Korea where it hurts
In a statement after the attack, NIS said, “We believe that North Korea might possibly be preparing to produce its own semiconductors in the face of difficulties in procuring them due to sanctions.”
Semiconductors are used in a number of complex weapons systems such as the targeting devices and computers used in inter-continental ballistic missiles, which has been a priority for North Korea for many years.
It is possible, NIS believes, that the hackers could have stolen sensitive product specifications and photographs of factory internals, however no details were released on the names of the companies targeted or if any data was successfully stolen.
Both Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are based in South Korea, and account for a significant share of both the DRAM and NAND global markets, according to BleepingComputer.
The hackers have increasingly been utilising techniques such as ‘living-off-the-land’, whereby the threat actors use legitimate existing programs within a network to hide their malicious activities.
There is currently a global semiconductor shortage due to supply chain issues and the rapid development of AI, which requires semiconductors in the technology used to train and run large language models (LLM).
In the face of the threat of espionage and supply chain security, the US has invested billions as part of the CHIPS act to domestically produce semiconductors, lowering the possibility of China and North Korea threatening the supply.
While the hermit kingdom has been subject to strict sanctions for over 70 years, it has significantly increased the sophistication of its cyber attacks over the past two decades.
North Korean-backed hackers are estimated to have stolen close to $3 billion worth of cryptocurrency since 2016 to help keep the regime afloat, and have conducted a number of crippling cyberattacks against a Western-aligned nations.",2024-03-05T11:26:50Z,https://www.techradar.com,TechRadar
Asian traders give bitcoin blast-off,"Bitcoin’s runaway rally is being driven by investors in Asia.
Traders in South Korea, China and other Asian countries are responsible for roughly 70% of bitcoin trading volumes, much like they were in 2021 when bitcoin last hit such heady highs, according to crypto exchange data from The Block.
Asia accounted for $791 billion of the $1.17 trillion worth of bitcoin traded in February, with North American investors lagging way behind with $113 billion, broadly reflecting a trend seen since November, the data shows.
In China, FOMO has gripped many small investors frustrated with an anemic stock market. On popular messaging app WeChat, searches for “bitcoin” jumped 12-fold in February.
“I want to buy some bitcoin at a good price and hold,” Mia Wang, a finance industry employee based in China’s eastern province of Zhejiang, told Reuters. “It has jumped a lot and is expensive now, but I worry it won’t have any correction.”
Bitcoin is trading at around $65,000 - close to its record of $69,000 - after an eye-popping 148% rise since early October, primarily driven by U.S. regulators approving spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). BlackRock’s iShares bitcoin trust has been a major beneficiary of such investment flows.
Traders have also poured into the world’s biggest cryptocurrency ahead of April’s “halving” event, which could reduce supply and push prices up. Supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million, of which 19 million tokens have already been mined.
The legality of trading and owning of bitcoin varies across Asian jurisdictions, ranging from Japan which has comparatively liberal regulations to China where there’s a ban. Spot bitcoin ETFs are banned in South Korea, but local brokers offer easy access to bitcoin futures ETFs.
KOREA GOES BIG ON BITCOIN
South Korea commands a 10% share of the bitcoin cash tokens and listed futures markets, estimates Hong Song-uk, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities.
South Koreans have made a net investment of $23.4 million in the U.S.-listed 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF this year, compared with $25.1 million in all of 2023, according to the Korea Securities Depository. In February, they also invested $6.89 million in Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF.
“Because trading of bitcoin ETFs has been banned here, more and more Koreans are buying bitcoin ETF futures, which is helping with its pop now,” said Hong.
Bitcoin trading volumes on Upbit roughly trebled to 67,000 coins last week versus the previous week, the South Korean exchange said.
Yet U.S.-based exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp and Binance, which operate in some Asian markets, continue to have the biggest share of global volumes at 50%, according to research firm Kaiko.
Hong Kong has decriminalized crypto trading over the past year, while allowing bitcoin ATMs and shops to cater to small investors and even offshore Chinese financial institutions.
The city’s largest bitcoin futures ETF, managed by CSOP Asset Management, has seen its assets under management swell five-fold in the past five months to over $100 million.
There is also huge interest in India, where several local crypto exchanges operate legally, but more trading is done on offshore exchanges such as Binance and KuCoin which do not levy the 1% transaction monitoring tax that local operators do.
Between July 2022 and July 2023, Indians traded crypto worth 350,000 crore rupees via offshore crypto platforms, accounting for more than 90% of the total crypto trading volume by Indians, according to estimates from the Esya Centre, a local think-tank.

For the unversed, gay marriage is not recognised in South Korea due to which many people keep their sexuality discreet, fearing social pressure. Also, Seoul’s annual Pride celebration attracts vicious Christian-led opposition.
Several attempts made over the past 16 years to pass broad anti-discrimination laws have failed due to strong opposition from conservative churches and civic groups who say the law will pave the way for legalisation of gay marriage.

South Korea pastor on Methodist Church’s decision
A report by AFP quoted Reverend Lee saying the church’s decision was “shameful” and he was considering bring the case to a civil court.
“Excommunicating a pastor for blessing sexual minorities will go down in history of Protestantism as dark history that will only invite laughter later,” Lee said.

Of 51 million people in South Korea, nearly a quarter are Christian. The religious community holds significant political sway, with many evangelicals strongly opposing gay rights.
However, globally, many religious groups have taken steps to embrace LGBTQI rights, with the Vatican recently approving Catholic blessings for same-sex couples.
As per South Korea’s Methodist Church, it has 1.2 million followers under its wing with 6,700 churches in and outside the country and 1,300 missionaries.

North Korea warns of 'dear price' for U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise,"Apache choppers take off at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, Monday as the Freedom Shield joint military exercise kicked off.

SEOUL, March 5 (UPI) -- North Korea warned Tuesday that the United States and South Korea will be ""made to pay a dear price"" for holding their annual Freedom Shield large-scale joint military exercise. An unnamed spokesperson for the North's Ministry of National Defense condemned the ""provocative"" 11-day exercise, which kicked off on Monday with ramped-up field training drills and a focus on countering threats from the nuclear-armed North.

The ministry ""strongly denounces the reckless military drills of the U.S. and [South Korea] for getting more undisguised in their military threat to a sovereign state and attempt for invading it,"" the statement, carried in state-run Korean Central News Agency, said.
The North Korean military will ""continue to watch the adventurist acts of the enemies and conduct responsible military activities to strongly control the unstable security environment on the Korean peninsula,"" the spokesperson said.
North Korea regularly condemns the allies' joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills in the past as a pretext for its own missile tests. Freedom Shield is the first joint exercise since the North scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military accord meant to reduce tensions along the border, raising additional concerns over a provocative response from Pyongyang.

On Tuesday, South Korea's Defense Ministry responded to the statement, calling Freedom Shield ""a defensive military exercise conducted regularly every year to prepare for North Korea's provocations and aggression.""
""Our military is thoroughly prepared for North Korea's provocations,"" a spokesman for the ministry said in a message to reporters. ""If North Korea makes a direct provocation under the pretext of joint exercises, we will respond overwhelmingly.""
The joint drills come as tensions remain at the highest point in years on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has conducted a flurry of weapons tests this year and has ramped up its bellicose rhetoric toward South Korea, labeling Seoul its ""principal enemy"" last month.
The United States and South Korea, meanwhile, have increased their military cooperation with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets such as aircraft carriers, a B-52 nuclear bomber and a nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the Korean Peninsula in recent months.
In addition to U.S. and South Korean forces, personnel from 11 other member countries of the United Nations Command are joining the exercise. Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Colombia, France, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand will take part in different capacities.",2024-03-05T09:38:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

"South Korea, US prep early talks on defence costs ahead of election","South Korea and the United States have named envoys to launch a new early round of talks on ways to share the cost of keeping American troops in South Korea, the countries said on Tuesday. The appointment of South Korea's Lee Tae-woo and the United States' Linda Specht comes unusually early for a deal set to take effect in 2026, perhaps aimed at reaching agreement before the possible re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.
Some 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea as part of efforts to deter nuclear-armed North Korea. South Korea began shouldering the costs of U.S. deployments, used to fund local labour, the construction of military installations and other logistics support, in the early 1990s.
""Both delegations will endeavour to engage in productive consultations that strengthen the combined defence posture and further solidify our alliance,"" the ministry and the U.S. State Department said in a joint statement. The early appointment was intended to ""allow sufficient time in advance"" to prepare but no date was set for a fresh round of talks, said Lim Soo-suk, a spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry.
""Looking at past cases, there were times when negotiations took quite a long time,"" he told a briefing. Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the November election, had during his presidency accused South Korea, a key Asian ally, of ""free-riding"" on U.S. military might, and demanded that it pay as much as $5 billion a year for the U.S. deployment.
South Korean media have said the planned early talks on the Special Measures Agreement aim at extending a deal to 2026 and beyond, before any potential comeback by Trump. The current agreement is set to expire in 2025, with negotiations on a successor pact usually held just before the end of the existing one.
During Trump's presidency, both sides had struggled for months to make progress, before reaching a deal when Seoul agreed to increase its contribution by 13.9%, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades. Lee, a seasoned diplomat with experience in U.S. and security affairs, previously served as consul-general in Sydney and deputy nuclear envoy for North Korea.
Specht is a senior adviser and lead negotiator for security pacts in the State Department's bureau of political and military affairs.

Thousands of Korean doctors face license suspensions as Seoul moves to prosecute strike leaders,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Thousands of striking junior doctors in South Korea faced proceedings to suspend their medical licenses Tuesday, as authorities are pushing for police investigations targeting leaders of the walkouts that have disrupted hospital operations.

Nearly 9,000 of South Korea’s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been refusing to work for the last two weeks to protest a government plan to enroll thousands more students in the country’s medical schools in coming years. The government ordered them to return to work by Feb. 29, citing a threat to public health, but most have defied threats of license suspensions and prosecutions.

“For those who lead the walkouts, we are thinking we’ll file complaints with police,” Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing. “But I tell you that we haven’t determined exactly when we would do so and against whom.”
Advertisement
On Monday, the Health Ministry sent officials to hospitals to confirm the absences of the striking doctors to begin administrative steps to suspend their licenses. So far, the government has formally confirmed the absences of more than 7,000 strikers, and on Tuesday, officials were to continue on-site inspections of hospitals and begin sending notices to some strikers about license suspension proceedings, Park said.

Park said the striking doctors' licenses would be suspended for at least three months, and doctors are to be given opportunities to respond before suspensions take effect.
“The trainee doctors have left their patients defenseless. They’ve even left emergency rooms and intensive care units,” Park said. “We can’t tolerate these irresponsible acts. They have betrayed their professional and ethical responsibilities and neglected their legal duties.”

Under South Korea's medical law, doctors who defy orders to resume work can be punished with three years in prison or a 30 million won (roughly $22,500) fine, as well as a up to one-year suspension of their medical licenses. Those who receive prison sentences can lose their licenses.
Observers say the government will likely end up punishing only strike leaders, not all of the thousands of striking doctors. They say it would take a few months to complete the administrative steps to suspend the licenses of all the 9,000 striking doctors.

At the heart of the dispute is a government plan to raise the country’s medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current 3,058. Officials said South Korea must add more doctors to deal with a fast-aging population. But many doctors say universities aren't ready to deal with that abrupt increase in the number of students and that the country's overall medical service would be eventually hurt.
The striking junior doctors are a small fraction of the country’s 140,000 doctors, but they account for 30-40% of the total doctors at some major hospitals, where they assist senior doctors while training.

Pyongyang warns of consequences over US-S. Korea drills,"With twice as many troops participating than in 2023, Washington and Seoul began their yearly spring military drills on Monday in an effort to be better equipped to counter Pyongyang’s growing nuclear threats, they have stated
North Korea demanded that the allies stop their “frantic war drills” on Tuesday, threatening to pay a “dear price” for Seoul and Washington’s large-scale military rehearsals that began this week.
This year, Pyongyang has warned war for “even 0.001 mm” of territorial violation, branded South Korea as its “principal enemy,” and sacked organisations tasked with outreach and reunification.

With twice as many troops participating than in 2023, Washington and Seoul began their yearly spring military drills on Monday in an effort to be better equipped to counter Pyongyang’s growing nuclear threats, they have stated.
The partners declared that “Freedom Shield” will comprise 48 field exercises, including live shooting, bombing, air attack and missile interception manoeuvres.
An unnamed spokesperson for the North’s defence ministry urged Seoul and Washington to cease the “reckless” and “frantic war drills”.
Pyongyang’s military “strongly denounces the reckless military drills of the US and the ROK” and “severely warns them to stop the moves further causing provocation and instability”, the spokesman said in a statement carried by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency, using South Korea’s official name.

South Korea begins licence suspension process against striking doctors,"SEOUL - South Korea said on March 5 it would start notifying striking trainee doctors that their medical licences would be suspended, as it moves to punish medics who have quit hospitals in protest at training reforms.
Thousands of junior doctors handed in their notice and stopped working two weeks ago to protest against an increase in medical school admissions from 2025.
The government says it is raising enrolment to help combat shortages and meet the demands of an ageing society.
The striking trainees defied a Feb 29 government deadline for them to return to work or face legal action, including possible arrest or suspension of their medical licences.
The government has identified some 7,800 junior doctors who have defied the back to work order and officials will send them notifications of their pending licence suspensions starting on March 5, Second Vice-Health Minister Park Min-soo told a press conference.
“As soon as their violations of the back to work orders are confirmed, we will send out advance notice of administrative measure starting today,” Mr Park said, referring to the licence suspension.
Despite the warning of suspension, striking junior doctors have not returned to work on any significant scale, government data shows.
As of March 4, nearly 9,000 trainee doctors remained on walkouts, Mr Park said, a figure that has not significantly changed over the last two weeks.
“The government will respond in accordance with laws and principles to keep acts of threatening people’s lives and health from occurring again,” Mr Park said.
The mass work stoppage has taken a toll on hospitals, with crucial treatments and surgeries cancelled, prompting the government to raise its public health alert to the highest level.
Around half of the surgeries scheduled at some major hospitals have been cancelled since last week, according to the health ministry.
Under South Korean law, doctors are restricted from striking, and the government has requested police investigate people connected to the stoppage.
The government is pushing to admit 2,000 more students to medical schools annually from 2025 to address what it calls one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations.",2024-03-05T04:43:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times

North Korea threatens military steps in response to US-South Korean drills,"North Korea has deemed ongoing South Korean-US military drills a plot to invade the country, as it threatened to take unspecified “responsible” military steps in response.
The North’s warning came on Tuesday, a day after the South Korean and US forces kicked off their annual computer-simulated command post training and a variety of field exercises for an 11 day run.

This year’s drills were to involve 48 field exercises, twice the number conducted last year.
In a statement carried by state media, the North’s defence ministry said it “strongly denounces the reckless military drills of the US and (South Korea) for getting more undisguised in their military threat to a sovereign state and attempt for invading it”.
An unidentified ministry spokesperson said North Korea’s military will “continue to watch the adventurist acts of the enemies and conduct responsible military activities to strongly control the unstable security environment on the Korean Peninsula”.

The spokesperson didn’t say what measures North Korea would take, but observers say North Korea will likely carry out missile tests or other steps to bolster its war capability.

South Korea’s defence ministry said later on Tuesday that its drills with the US is a regular, defensive training.
A ministry statement said South Korea will make an overwhelming response if North Korea launches direct provocations against it during the drills.
North Korea views its rivals’ major military drills as invasion rehearsals, though South Korean and US officials have repeatedly said they have no intentions of attacking the North.
North Korea has previously reacted to South Korean-US exercises with launches of a barrage of missiles into the sea.

South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said last week that this year’s military drills with the US were designed to neutralise North Korean nuclear threats and would involve live-firing, bombing, air assault and missile interception drills.
Concerns about North Korea’s nuclear program have grown in the past two years, as the North has test-launched missiles at a record pace and openly threatened to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively.
The US and South Korea have expanded their military exercises and increased the deployment of powerful US military assets like aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable bombers in response.

This year, North Korea performed six rounds of missile tests and artillery firing drills.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un also declared his country won’t seek reconciliation with South Korea and vowed to scrap the country’s long-running goal of peaceful unification with South Korea.
He said North Korea would take a more aggressive military posture along the disputed sea boundary with South Korea.
Experts say North Korea could believe a bigger weapons arsenal would provide it with a greater leverage in future diplomacy with the US.
They say North Korea is desperate to win an international recognition as a nuclear state, a status that it would think helps it win relief of US-led economic sanctions.

LCK boss says league 'does not stop' in defiance of 'criminal' DDoS attacks,"Professional League of Legends in Korea has been under attack over the last week-plus, with DDoS attacks affecting the LCK dating back to Feb. 25. These attacks caused matches to be stricken with pauses and single games to last hours beyond their posted in-game timers.

The secretary general of the LCK, Aiden Lee, released a statement on behalf of the league today, apologizing for the inconvenience the attacks have caused, as well as slamming down the gauntlet and laying out the league’s strategy to stop these attacks and return to a state of “normalization.”

The current plan in place is to gradually move back to live broadcasts—at first with no fans in attendance—as soon as the league feels confident in its countermeasures to keep the attackers at bay. “We had hoped to implement it sooner, but realistically, the conditions require more time,” Lee said in his statement. “If no major problems arise in the process, we plan to return to normal as soon as possible so that fans can watch and support their favorite teams on-site. If there are any changes, we will keep you updated.”
A message from Secretary General Aiden Lee to LCK fans: pic.twitter.com/ixDRuXc5hx — LCK (@LCK) March 4, 2024
This decision to play in an empty arena is likely to keep fans from having to wait in the LoL Park studio for an exorbitant amount of time while league officials attempt to combat DDoS’ers. On Feb. 25, League fans stuck around for all seven hours of a series between Dplus KIA and DRX, which is obviously a situation the LCK rather wouldn’t have repeated.
Starting on Feb. 29, LCK games were moved to a pre-recorded structure that caused teams to play their matches under private circumstances before they were broadcast at a later time to the fans. Still, this wasn’t enough to prevent attempted DDoS attacks in certain scenarios, with the league saying today there were “several attacks” in the pre-recorded environment, but the measures it had in place were enough to prevent the attacks from making a significant impact.
But that’s not to say the LCK doesn’t anticipate the onslaught to carry on. The league is very much aware of the issue, and top brass is in no rush to return to a live environment, where the risk of a successful DDoS attack could cripple yet another LCK broadcast. In the meantime, Riot Korea is working closely with law enforcement to bring the DDoS attackers to justice, calling the disruption a “clear criminal act.”
Finally, the league swatted away any notion of a complete shutdown, saying that “countless” people would be affected if the LCK went on a temporary hiatus and that any pause would effectively give the DDoS attackers a symbolic victory. “When one method is blocked, they find other ways to attack so it is hard to predict what will happen in advance,” Lee said. “But whatever the case may be, we will find a solution. We will do everything we can to make sure the LCK does not stop.”
The next LCK broadcast will begin at 2am CT on March 6, with DRX and BRION set to square off in a pre-recorded match.",2024-03-04T19:43:50Z,https://dotesports.com,Dot Esports

We in India host a Fusion Centre which is built as a result of a number of White Shipping agreements with different partners where you actually have a common operative picture across the entire Indian ocean,"" Jaishankar said addressing a gathering at the Korean National Diplomatic Academy.
“Similarly, RoK’s participation in initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative, which looks at a range of oceanic issues from ecology and environment to transport and science technology, would, I think, be a very valuable addition,"" he said.
India’s top diplomat was referring to the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR), which is hosted by the Indian Navy and headquartered in Gurugram. It has 25 partner countries, including the US, Japan, Australia, and Bangladesh.
Jaishankar also suggested cooperation through the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, both of which are led by India.
He also called for greater cooperation on supply chain security and for expediting the review of the India-Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which was signed in 2009.
India has raised concerns about its unbalanced trade with Korea, which tilts heavily towards Seoul.
During his visit, Jaishankar met with Korea’s Prime Minister Han Duck-Soo, trade minister Ahn Dukgeun, and director of national security Chang Ho-jin.

South Korea's Spy Satellite Begins Watching Kim Jong Un's North,"South Korea's first homemade surveillance satellite has begun transmitting images of the North, including central Pyongyang, at a time when relations between the two neighbors are at their most acrimonious in decades.
""Pyongyang's central area and vessels at a port are clearly seen,"" reported South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, quoting an anonymous military source's analysis of the current test imagery.
The satellite was launched from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on December 1, less than two weeks after North Korea succeeded on its third attempt in putting its own spy satellite into orbit. Washington and Seoul decried this as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions aimed at curbing the North's ballistic missile program.
While avoiding specifying subjects of the surveillance, citing security concerns, the source reportedly said the satellite had captured ""good"" resolution images of central Pyongyang.
That part of the North Korean capital is home to a number of government complexes including the headquarters of the one-party state's Workers' Party of Korea, and the office of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.
The spacecraft was also said to have snapped photos of ships at port.
Yonhap cited other sources as saying the satellite images require significant editing. Higher resolution pictures are expected from next month, and the project is set to ""enter its full reconnaissance mission by June or July, as planned.""
This was the first of five South Korean surveillance satellites SpaceX is contracted to launch by next year, leading to less reliance on U.S. surveillance capabilities.

The next four will be equipped with a synthetic aperture radar, allowing observation of the Earth's surface clearly at night, and through cloud cover.
The dueling satellite launches late last year sent the already heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula soaring, and these latest move risk moving the dial further.
The South responded in protest by partially suspending a landmark North-South military agreement, pledging to resume patrols along the demarcation line between the countries. The North countered by exiting the 2018 pact entirely and declaring it would redeploy its own forces to the area.
Despite a 1953 armistice that put an end to three years of fighting, there has never been a treaty to end the war.
Newsweek contacted the North Korean embassy in China with a written request for comment.
The North's claim that its satellite, christened the Malligyong-1, was monitoring the White House, Pentagon, and other high-profile locations surprised some skeptics, including South Korea's defense chief who had said he believed the craft was derelict in space.
Netherlands-based space expert reported observed the satellite ""jumping"" to a higher orbit in recent weeks, demonstrating at the very least a functional propulsion system.",2024-03-04T16:46:01Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
What's next for South Korean doctors who face license suspensions because of walkouts,"South Korea's government is pressing ahead with its vow to suspend the licenses of thousands of junior doctors who ignore its repeated demands to end their collective walkouts.
Nearly 9,000 out of the country's 13,000 medical interns and residents have been refusing to work for about two weeks to protest a government plan to increase South Korea's medical school admission quota by about two thirds.
Here are some questions and answers about what's next in the strike: HOW DOES THE SUSPENSION WORK? After their walkouts caused hundreds of surgeries and other treatments to be cancelled, the government ordered the junior doctors to return to work by February 29 or face license suspensions and possible legal charges. Most of them missed the deadline.
On Monday, the government dispatched officials to about 50 hospitals to formally confirm the absence of striking doctors, before informing them of their license suspensions and giving them a chance to respond.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo said the doctors face a minimum three-month suspension. Suspension records will leave them facing a one-year delay in getting licenses for specialists and further barriers in landing jobs, Park said. Park suggested it would take weeks to complete procedures for suspending licenses. Once it's done, some striking doctors will likely respond with legal action. Hyeondeok Choi, partner at the law firm Daeryun that specialises in medical law, said it would be ""impossible"" for the government to suspend the licenses of all the 9,000 doctors. He said the government would likely target less than 100 of the leading strikers. The Korea Medical Association, which represents 140,000 doctors in South Korea, said it supports the junior doctors' walkouts. Joo Sooho, a spokesperson at the KMA's emergency committee, said Monday that senior doctors are considering economic support for the strikers if their licenses are suspended. WHAT OTHER STEPS THE STRIKERS CAN FACE? South Korea's medical law says doctors who refuse the government's back-to-work order can face up to three years in prison or a 30 million won (USD 22,480) fine, as well as up to one year of license suspensions. Those sent to prison or given even suspended prison sentences automatically lose their licenses.
The Health Ministry can file complaints with police, who then investigate and hand the case to prosecutors for a possible indictment, according to Choi, the law firm partner.
Joo said the Korea Medical Association will provide lawyers to the striking doctors if they are summoned by police or prosecutors. South Korean police said they are investigating five senior members of the Korea Medical Association, after the Health Ministry filed complaints against them for allegedly inciting and abetting the junior doctors' walkouts. WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY? The doctors' strikes have so far failed to generate public support, with a survey showing about 80 per cent backing the government's punitive action. The government says South Korea urgently needs more doctors to deal with a rapidly aging population. Many doctors say a too-steep increase in the number of students would eventually result in undermining medical service. Some critics say doctors, the highest-paid profession in South Korea, worry about losing their income. Lee Yeonha, 40, said the striking doctors were ""too selfish'' and a three-month license suspension is too little. ""I wish the government would take more powerful legal action to get the doctors to fear that they may not be able to work as doctors in this country,"" Lee said.
Another Seoul resident, Sunny Shin, supports the arguments by doctors that the government must first resolve fundamental problems such as a lack of medical liability protection and a shortage of physicians in key yet low-paying specialties such as pediatrics and emergency departments.
""As long as the crucial sector doctors are likely to be embroiled in lawsuits and still not highly paid, I cannot blame them for protesting against the government labelling them as privileged people neglecting their duties as doctors,"" Shin said.

North Korea Cyber Hack Hits US Ally,"A North Korean cyberattack successfully infiltrated a strategic industry and lifted data that could help it overcome a technological blockade, an intelligence disclosure by the South said on Monday.
In a warning to South Korea's chipmakers and the wider semiconductor industry, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), Seoul's main spy agency, said at least two companies were targeted in the last three months. Hackers stole design drawings as well as photographs of equipment, the NIS said.
North Korea's state-backed cyber actors hit ""Company A"" and ""Company B"" in December, according to the disclosure, which said Company B was hit again last month.
Kim Jong Un's economy is struggling due to poor central planning and the weight of international sanctions, which are likely to remain as he steps up ballistic missile launches and threatens to restart nuclear tests.
North Korea has turned to cyber hacking to fund its defense industry, targeting everything from state secrets to cryptocurrency. Kim's government has also allegedly engaged in arms trading with Russia to help advance its military capabilities, including a recently launched spy satellite.
It was not the first time cyber actors linked to the regime in Pyongyang had been accused of stealing secrets from Seoul's strategic industries. But this comes at a particularly fractious time in North-South relations, with Kim having abandoned any hopes of reconciliation on the peninsula.
Semiconductors have become a strategic commodity of late. The tiny microchips are used in everything from kettles and electric cars to guided missiles and fighter jets.
The U.S., eager to ensure the most advanced chipmaking know-how stays in allied hands, has in recent years moved to swiftly cut off China's access to the latest technologies, although the policy is only expected to slow, rather than stop, Beijing's heavily subsidized chipmakers.

North Korea lacks the same resources, especially in technical training, and is using sophisticated hacking techniques to get its hands on the latest industry knowledge, according to the South.
Seoul's chief intelligence service believes heavily sanctioned Pyongyang ""may have begun preparing to produce its own semiconductors"" due to difficulties procuring chips from other parties. North Korean demand for the technology is increasing in order to develop weapons such as satellites and missiles, the agency said.
South Korea said the North's hacking group, which was not identified by name, targeted the companies through servers connected to the internet. The alleged culprit used a method known as ""living off the land,"" which makes cyberattacks on vulnerable systems much more difficult to detect.
Guidance issued in February by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the technique was frequently used by ""People's Republic of China and Russian Federation state-sponsored actors.""
""LOTL [living-off-the-land attacks] enables threat actors to conduct their operations discreetly as they can camouflage activity with typical system and network behavior, potentially circumventing basic endpoint security capabilities,"" the joint advisory said.
South Korea said hacking victims were notified and the industry was cautioned to increase its cybersecurity measures, including by conducting its own checks.
""We must implement security updates and access control for servers exposed to the internet, and thoroughly manage accounts, including strengthening administrator authentication on a regular basis,"" an unnamed intelligence official was quoted as saying in the NIS report.
South Korea said 80 percent of cyberattacks hitting its public institutions have been tracked back to the North.

South Korea to suspend licenses of striking doctors as they refuse to end walkouts,"SEOUL — South Korea’s government began steps Monday to suspend the medical licenses of thousands of striking junior doctors, days after they missed a government-set deadline to end their joint walkouts, which have severely impacted hospital operations.
Nearly 9,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike for two weeks to protest a government push to sharply increase the number of medical school admissions. Their action has led to hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments and threatened to burden the country’s medical service.
On Monday, officials were sent to dozens of hospitals to formally confirm the absence of the striking doctors as the government began steps to suspend their licenses for at least three months, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing.
Park said authorities would later notify the striking doctors of their expected license suspensions and give them a chance to respond. He suggested the license suspensions would take weeks to go into effect.
“Despite repeated appeals by the government and other parts of society, the number of trainee doctors returning to work is very insignificant. Starting from today, we begin the execution of law with the on-site inspection,” Park said.
Park again repeated the government’s call for the doctors to end their walkouts.
“We again strongly urge them to return to patients by not ignoring the pains of patients hovering between life and death — and their families,” he said.

South Korea’s government earlier ordered the striking doctors to return to work by Feb. 29. South Korea’s medical law allows the government to make such back-to-work orders to doctors when it sees grave risks to public health. Anyone who refuses to follow such orders can be punished with a suspension of his or her license for up to one year, and three years in prison or a 30 million won (roughly $22,500) fine.
Last month, the South Korean government announced it would raise the country’s medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current 3,058. Officials said it’s urgent to have more doctors to deal with a fast-aging population and resolve a shortage of physicians in rural areas and essential yet low-paying specialties like pediatrics and emergency departments.
Officials say South Korea’s doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest among developed countries.
But many doctors have opposed the plan, arguing universities can’t offer quality education to such an abrupt increase in students. They also say adding so many new doctors would also increase public medical expenses since greater competition would lead to excess treatments. They also predict newly added students would also want to work in high-paying, popular professions like plastic surgery and dermatology.
Critics say many doctors oppose the government plan simply because they worry adding more doctors would result in a lower income.
The striking junior doctors are a small fraction of the country’s 140,000 doctors. But they account for 30-40% of the total doctors at some major hospitals, where they assist senior doctors while training.
Senior doctors have staged a slew of street rallies supporting the young doctors but haven’t joined their walkouts. Police said they were investigating five ranking members of the Korea Medical Association, a body that represents South Korean doctors, for allegedly inciting and abetting the walkouts.",2024-03-04T11:32:21Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
"5 things to know for March 4: Election 2024, Gaza, Immigration, Supreme Court, North Korea","By AJ Willingham, CNN
(CNN) — Will it end in fire or ice? Texas is still coping with the record-setting Smokehouse Creek Fire which has burned more than 1 million acres, while parts of Northern California were buried this weekend under a raging blizzard.
Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.
1. Election 2024
It’s going to be a defining week for the 2024 presidential elections. The results of the 15-state Super Tuesday GOP Primaries should put former President Donald Trump even closer to the Republican nomination, and President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Thursday will give him a chance to make his case to a divided nation. Over the weekend, Trump took all 39 Michigan GOP primary delegates despite party leadership battles in the state. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley also won the DC GOP primary — her first of the year. Despite the growing inevitability of a Trump nomination, Haley isn’t letting up on her fellow Republican: In an interview with NBC, Haley suggested she’s no longer bound by a Republican National Committee pledge to support the eventual nominee.
2. Gaza
Talks for a ceasefire in Gaza are still plodding along as more children succumb to starvation in the war-torn region. Negotiators gathered in Cairo on Sunday for talks on an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal and the release of hostages from Gaza, but Israel did not send a delegation. Hamas has said it wants a permanent end to the fighting before hostages are released. Meanwhile, calls are growing in the US for an end to the violence. Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday forcefully called for more humanitarian aid and urged Israel to do more to allow it into the enclave, saying that people are “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, told CNN Sunday that killing in the region “has to stop.”
3. Immigration
A controversial Texas immigration law could go into effect this week if the Supreme Court doesn’t intervene. Senate Bill 4 would allow state law enforcement authorities to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally. A federal judge blocked the bill last week, saying it could open the door for every state to pass its own version of immigration laws, but an appeals court granted a temporary stay. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott supports the legislation, which immigration advocates warn could increase racial profiling and detentions in the state. Abbott has been highly critical of what he sees as President Biden’s inaction at the border. Last week, Abbott said Biden should use his executive authority to handle the crisis. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas responded that it is the responsibility of Congress to agree on a solution.
4. Supreme Court
The Supreme Court may hand down at least one opinion today, driving speculation that the justices are prepared to decide whether Donald Trump is eligible to appear on Colorado’s presidential ballot. The court never discloses in advance which opinions it will issue, but there is a time element here: Colorado’s primary is coming up tomorrow on Super Tuesday. The ruling may also decide the matter for other states that have similar challenges pending. Arguments about Trump’s eligibility stem from the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist clause,” and challengers claim he disqualified himself with his actions on and around the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
5. North Korea
South Korea and the US have begun their annual Freedom Shield joint military drills to bolster readiness against North Korea. The exercises focus on deterring North Korea’s nuclear threats and will incorporate other training to enhance cooperation “through air, land, sea, space, cyber and special operations,” according to United States Forces Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has drawn a hard line against South Korea in recent months, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification and instructing the country to accelerate war preparations. North Korea has also fostered closer ties with Russia and provided Moscow with arms for its war in Ukraine. That sets up a dangerous partnership that could provide North Korea with more nuclear capabilities.

"U.S., South Korea begin large-scale joint military exercise on tense Korean Peninsula","1 of 3 | A South Korean tank is seen at a live-fire joint drill in Pocheon, South Korea on May 25, 2023. On Monday, the United States and South Korea kicked off their 11-day Freedom Shield joint military exercise amid mounting nuclear threats from North Korea.

SEOUL, March 4 (UPI) -- The United States and South Korea kicked off an 11-day joint military exercise Monday, defense officials said, including ramped-up field training drills and a focus on countering threats from the nuclear-armed North. The annual springtime Freedom Shield exercise began as scheduled, a South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman confirmed to reporters. It consists of both computer-simulated and field-based training and will run until March 14. This year's exercise includes 48 joint field drills -- almost twice as many as last year -- including air assault and tactical live-fire and bombing drills. Advertisement
The exercise comes as tensions remain at the highest point in years on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has conducted a flurry of weapons tests this year and has ramped up its bellicose rhetoric toward South Korea, labeling Seoul its ""principal enemy"" last month.
North Korea regularly condemns the allies' joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills as a pretext for its own missile tests. Freedom Shield is the first joint exercise since North Korea scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military accord meant to reduce tensions along the border, raising additional concerns over a provocative response from Pyongyang.

At a press briefing last week, U.S. Forces Korea spokesman Col. Isaac Taylor said that the Freedom Shield exercise has always been conducted for training and deterrence purposes.
""Professional militaries train,"" Taylor said. ""The U.S. and ROK have worked together for years to ensure security and stability here on the peninsula. If you look back historically, the exercise has been defensive in nature.""
In addition to U.S. and South Korean forces, personnel from 11 other member countries of the United Nations Command are joining the exercise. Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Colombia, France, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand will take part in different capacities, the USFK said.
The U.S.-led UNC plays a key role in maintaining and enforcing the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War, with duties that include controlling DMZ access and communicating with the North Korean military.
Alongside Freedom Shield, the U.S. and South Korean Air Forces began a separate joint air training exercise Monday at Osan Air Base, about 40 miles south of Seoul.
Some 20 aircraft, including Korean F-15K and U.S. F-16 fighter jets, will participate in drills, such as defensive counter-air operations, the South Korean Air Force said in a press release. It will run through Friday and is the first of eight such joint air exercises scheduled for this year.

South Korea and the United States began their annual Freedom Shield joint military drills on Monday to bolster readiness against North Korea.
The 11-day drills will integrate elements of “live exercises” with constructive simulations, according to United States Forces Korea (USFK) and South Korea’s Defense Ministry.
The exercises will focus on deterring North Korea’s nuclear threats, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung-jun said last week.
USFK said in a statement that the drills “will include but not be limited to lessons learned from current and ongoing conflicts to increase the units’ combat readiness and combined defense posture, as well as strengthen the security and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across Northeast Asia.”
In addition to Freedom Shield, the two allies are conducting several smaller field training exercises to enhance their defense posture and cooperation “through air, land, sea, space, cyber and special operations,” the USFK said in its statement.
North Korea has previously condemned US and South Korea joint military drills, but it has not yet made any official comment or response to the current exercises.
Video Ad Feedback Kim Jong Un just destroyed part of his father's legacy. Here's how 00:34 - Source: CNN
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has drawn an increasingly harder line against South Korea in recent months, saying the North will no longer seek reconciliation and reunification with the South and instructing the country’s army, munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to accelerate war preparations in response to “confrontation moves” by the US.
In January, Kim called the South the North’s “primary foe and invariable principal enemy” and ordered a reunification monument in the North Korean capital to be demolished.
Meanwhile, North Korea has fostered closer ties with Russia, providing Moscow with arms for its war in Ukraine. In return, Western analysts say Russia could be a source of technology and expertise for Kim as he refines a nuclear-capable missile program that could threaten not only his neighbors in East Asia, but possibly the mainland United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles.",2024-03-04T08:30:55Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network
India-Korea must revive defence cooperation with '3 Rs' method. Jaishankar visit will do that,"These six years have witnessed tectonic shifts in the strategic postures of both nations. A notable evolution is discernible in Seoul’s strategic prism, marked by the ascendancy of a new conservative administration and the concomitant embrace of a pragmatic foreign policy orientation. This strategic recalibration, catalysed by the evolving power dynamics within the Indo-Pacific theatre, particularly vis-à-vis China’s assertive military ascendancy, finds resonance in India’s recalibration toward a more proactive engagement with like-minded regional stakeholders. This strategic repositioning is a direct response to the exacerbation of India-China border tensions, compelling Delhi to foster closer ties with its regional counterparts.
Emanating from these official pronouncements is a resounding chorus advocating for the fortification of the existing partnership, thereby accentuating the exigency to meticulously dissect the pathways toward enhancing bilateral relations. This meeting assumes profound significance, underscored by two salient factors. First, it is convening after a hiatus of six years; second, it will be held against the backdrop of dramatic shifts in the regional strategic milieu during this interregnum. This confluence of circumstances underscores the imperative for a profound introspection, necessitating a paradigmatic shift toward the recalibration, redefinition, and restrategisation of Indo-Korea relations.
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s upcoming visit to Seoul from 5 to 6 March 2024 to co-chair the 10th India-Republic of Korea Joint Commission Meeting with his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul heralds a watershed moment in Delhi-Seoul bilateral diplomatic engagements. The JCM envisages a comprehensive review of bilateral cooperation with a concerted effort to explore avenues for its augmentation. Concurrently, the press briefing statement disseminated by South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs underscores the JCM’s significance as an opportunity to consolidate the ‘special strategic partnership’ with India, an indisputable linchpin in the Indo-Pacific geopolitical landscape.
Concomitant with Seoul’s strategic recalibration is the acknowledgement of the Indo-Pacific paradigm, which has emerged as the lodestar guiding strategic deliberations in both New Delhi and Seoul. South Korea’s articulation of its Indo-Pacific strategy, underpinned by a nuanced understanding of the region’s geopolitical imperatives, resonates synergistically with India’s proactive endeavours aimed at fortifying regional maritime security architectures. It shows Delhi and Seoul’s shared commitment toward shaping a stable and rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific theatre.

Transforming India-Korea relations
A transformative impetus underpins the imperative to infuse substantive content into bilateral relations, transcending the transactional predilections that were, till now, predominant in India-Korea engagements. The architecture of India-Korea relations must transcend the economic realm, embracing a holistic strategic calculus underpinned by shared normative values and convergent strategic interests. At the vanguard of this strategic repositioning lies maritime cooperation, envisaged along three cardinal axes, each embodying strategic imperatives intrinsic to the Indo-Pacific epoch.
Foremost amongst these axes is the imperative to fortify regional security architectures, predicated upon normative consensus vis-à-vis the Indo-Pacific security calculus. South Korea’s vocalisation vis-à-vis China’s assertive behaviour in maritime domains, mirrored by India’s forthrightness, underscores the shared imperative to uphold the rules-based international order.
Augmenting defence collaboration assumes paramount significance as the second axis of maritime cooperation. A bilateral maritime cooperative framework, underpinned by the enforcement of international maritime law, joint patrols, and bolstering domain awareness, serves as the sine qua non for fortifying regional security architectures. The infusion of cutting-edge technological interventions, exemplified by maritime cybersecurity cooperation, augments operational capabilities and resilience against emergent maritime threats.
The third axis of maritime cooperation converges upon the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), envisaging a confluence of efforts aimed at enhancing the country’s maritime capabilities. Closer coordination, epitomised by South Korea’s liaison officer to India’s Information Fusion Centre, will lay the foundation for synergistic endeavours aimed at enhancing maritime domain awareness. This symbiotic partnership will not only fortify India’s role as the net security provider in the IOR but also safeguards South Korea’s interests in the Western IOR.
Such collaborative efforts, akin to the interlocking cogs of a well-oiled machine, infuse vitality into the India-Korea partnership, propelling it beyond the confines of conventional paradigms toward a future characterised by resilience, dynamism, and strategic foresight. In essence, the impending convocation of the JCM symbolises more than a mere diplomatic engagement; it embodies a clarion call for recalibrating the contours of India-Korea relations in consonance with the imperatives of the Indo-Pacific century. Through a strategic repositioning underpinned by maritime cooperation, India and South Korea chart a course toward a future characterised by synergy, resilience, and strategic foresight.
Moreover, delving into the historical maritime ties between India and South Korea can provide valuable context for understanding the depth of their relationship. Ancient trade routes, cultural exchanges, and shared maritime heritage between the two nations underscore the natural affinity for enhancing maritime cooperation. Economic interdependence further solidifies the argument for cooperation. The significant trade volumes, investments, and joint ventures between India and South Korea highlight the critical role of maritime security in preserving economic interests, emphasising the need for collaborative efforts to ensure secure sea lanes for trade and energy transport.

A ‘3 Rs’ methodology
Multilateral engagement offers additional avenues for cooperation. Platforms such as the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) provide frameworks for India and South Korea to collaborate within broader regional security initiatives, demonstrating a shared commitment to stability and security in the Indo-Pacific. Technological innovation in maritime security is paramount. Exploring emerging technologies such as unmanned maritime vehicles, satellite surveillance, and artificial intelligence can facilitate joint research and development efforts, enhancing maritime domain awareness and operational capabilities.
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) efforts underscore the humanitarian aspect of maritime cooperation. Past collaborations in providing disaster relief or conducting joint exercises for humanitarian purposes showcase the broader societal benefits of maritime security cooperation. Addressing environmental challenges in the maritime domain is also crucial. Collaboration on marine pollution, illegal fishing, and climate change mitigation can contribute to environmental protection and sustainable resource management, fostering long-term cooperation.
Cultural and educational exchanges related to maritime affairs further enrich the relationship. Initiatives such as student exchange programmes, joint research projects, or maritime heritage tourism promote mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of India and South Korea, laying the groundwork for deeper maritime collaboration.
By incorporating these supplementary elements, the rationale for embracing a 3 Rs methodology — redefine, reinvent, and restrategise — India-Korea maritime collaboration becomes significantly more robust and all-encompassing. It underscores the imperative for both nations to not only envision but actively pursue a collaborative framework that is agile, innovative, and strategically aligned with the evolving dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region.
Amid the Indo-Pacific’s shifting power dynamics, the time has come for both countries to rejuvenate their defence cooperation using the 3 Rs strategy: redefining shared objectives, reinventing naval capabilities, and restrategising for regional challenges.
Let the push begin with Jaishankar’s visit to Seoul.

South Korea takes steps to suspend licenses of striking doctors after they refuse to end walkouts,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s government began steps Monday to suspend the medical licenses of thousands of striking junior doctors, days after they missed a government-set deadline to end their joint walkouts, which have severely impacted hospital operations.
Nearly 9,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike for two weeks to protest a government push to sharply increase the number of medical school admissions. Their action has led to hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments and threatened to burden the country’s medical service.
On Monday, officials were sent to dozens of hospitals to formally confirm the absence of the striking doctors as the government began steps to suspend their licenses for at least three months, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing.
Park said authorities will later notify the striking doctors of their expected license suspensions and give them a chance to respond. He suggested the license suspensions would take weeks to go into effect.
""Despite repeated appeals by the government and other parts of society, the number of trainee doctors returning to work is very insignificant. Starting from today, we begin the execution of law with the on-site inspection,” Park said.
Park again repeated the government's call for the doctors to end their walkouts.
""We again strongly urge them to return to patients by not ignoring the pains of patients hovering between life and death — and their families,” he said.
South Korea's government earlier ordered the striking doctors to return to work by Feb. 29. South Korea's medical law allows the government to make such back-to-work orders to doctors when it sees grave risks to public health. Anyone who refuses to follow such orders can be punished with a suspension of his or her license for up to one year, and three years in prison or a 30 million won (roughly $22,500) fine.
Last month, the South Korean government announced it would raise the country's medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current 3,058. Officials said it's urgent to have more doctors to deal with a fast-aging population and resolve a shortage of physicians in rural areas and essential yet low-paying specialties like pediatrics and emergency departments.
Officials say South Korea’s doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest among developed countries.
But many doctors have opposed the plan, arguing universities can't offer quality education to such an abrupt increase in students. They also say adding so many new doctors would also increase public medical expenses since greater competition would lead to excess treatments. They also predict newly added students would also want to work in high-paying, popular professions like plastic surgery and dermatology.
Critics say many doctors oppose the government plan simply because they worry adding more doctors would result in a lower income.
The striking junior doctors are a small fraction of the country's 140,000 doctors. But they account for 30-40% of the total doctors at some major hospitals, where they assist senior doctors while training.
Senior doctors have staged a slew of street rallies supporting the young doctors but haven’t joined their walkouts. Police said they were investigating five ranking members of the Korea Medical Association, a body that represents South Korean doctors, for allegedly inciting and abetting the walkouts.

South Korea moves to suspend licenses of thousands of protesting doctors,"For more than a month, young doctors have been in a high-stakes dispute with the government over the future of health care in the country. Nearly 10,000 interns and residents, about one-tenth of all doctors in the nation, have walked off the job, with most ignoring a Thursday deadline to return to work. On Monday, the government said it would begin to suspend the licenses of around 7,000 of those doctors.
The announcement came after thousands of physicians, nurses, and medical professionals took to the streets Sunday, rallying with banners that read: “Doctors are not criminals!”
SEOUL — The South Korean government on Monday said that it was moving to suspend the licenses of thousands of doctors who walked off the job nearly two weeks ago, threatening to escalate a dispute that has shaken the nation’s health care system.

But two weeks after the walkout, it remains unclear how the disagreement will be resolved.
“Why would we want to go back after the government has treated us like the bad guys and has not addressed our demands?” said Lee Haeju, 32, who until recently was a resident at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital.
Lee — who said that she was so sleep deprived during her first year of residency that she felt like she operated on a 48-hour cycle instead of 24 — and her cohort have long complained about the pressures they face.
They say that some of them do not even make minimum wage, that their work conditions are Dickensian, and that they are overburdened by complaints from litigation-happy patients. The authorities, they say, have long ignored systemic issues that made specializations like dermatology and cosmetic surgery more lucrative than essential services like emergency care.
Last month, the government issued a new health care policy that it said would address a longstanding shortage of doctors by increasing medical school admissions by about 65 percent a year. But interns and residents, known as trainee doctors, said the government was continuing to ignore the real issues facing doctors.

“How many people would actually work in our department?” said Lee, who specializes in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery.
Surveys show widespread public support for increasing medical school admissions, the quota for which was last raised in 2006. The government points to statistics that show South Korea has one of the fewest doctors per capita in the developed world. And it says that increasing the number of doctors is crucial in a country with a rapidly aging society.
Facing legal threats, hundreds of trainee doctors have returned to work, but the vast majority of them continue to protest.
The orders were issued to “prevent serious hazards posed by the collective actions of trainee doctors,” Cho Kyoo-hong, the health minister, said in a written reply to questions.
Under South Korean law, the government can force some doctors back to work to avoid a disruption of care. Violators may face a fine of up to 30 million won ($22,000) or jail time of up to three years.
For now, patients have been directed to smaller hospitals and clinics. Major hospitals have had up to half of their operations delayed, and nurses have been allowed to assume some of the duties of doctors. The government has opened military hospitals and increased operating times for public clinics, and while there have been disruptions, the health system has not buckled.

Trainee doctors are a crucial cog in the medical system in South Korea. In major hospitals, they often make up one-third of staff and often are the first caregivers to attend to patients.
Park Dan, 33, said he wanted to be an emergency room doctor to save lives. As a resident at Severance Hospital in Seoul, one of South Korea’s biggest hospitals, he said he worked 100-hour weeks, often saw 20 patients every 60 minutes, and had to hold off going to the bathroom for hours on end.
“I thought my own life might be cut short in my effort to save others,” said Park, who is also the head of the Korean Intern Resident Association.
South Korea has a universal health care system that provides care for all citizens. But doctors argue that the government has underinvested in essential services, making specializations such as emergency care and pediatrics less financially appealing to physicians. The government has said it would spend about 10 trillion won, or $7.5 billion, on essential health services over the next five years.
Early-career doctors in South Korea typically work longer weeks and earn less than their counterparts in the United States. Interns and residents make about $3,000 a month, which is less than minimum wage, considering their long workweeks, according to Lee Jaehee, a lawyer who is representing some of the doctors who have walked out. Their shifts cap out at 36 hours, and their workweek can stretch to 88 hours.

For trainee doctors, the situation is “similar to the Industrial Revolution when young boys and girls were forced to work in factories,” said Dr. Lim Hyun Taek, the president of the Korean Pediatric Association.
This is not the first time doctors have protested a government plan to increase the medical school admissions quota. In 2020, a monthlong strike by doctors forced authorities to shelve a similar plan. But this time, the government has so far remained steadfast in its position and criticism, arguing that the walkout has compromised the health and safety of the public.
The doctors reject that notion.
“We’ve cried with patients and have held their hands along the way to their recovery,” Lee said. “We’re not criminals.”

'Doctors who have not returned might face problems in career': South Korea to take legal action,"The government had warned the protesting doctors to return to work by the end of Feb or else face legal actions including the suspension of their medical licenses for some surgeries and treatments and straining emergency departments
As trainee doctors in South Korea continue their protests despite the government’s order to cease all demonstrations, the country’s health ministry on Monday said that it will start taking legal action against the healthcare workers to bring an end to their walkout.
South Korea has been witnessing a healthcare crisis since Feb 20 after 9,000 resident and intern doctors, or about 70 per cent of the country’s total, have walked off their jobs leading to the cancellation of some surgeries and treatments and straining emergency departments.

“The government’s absurd medical policy has triggered immense resistance by trainee doctors and medical students, and we doctors have become one,” Park Sung-min, a senior member of the Korea Medical Association, said in a speech at the rally. “I’m asking the government: Please, stop the threats and suppression now.”

While the senior doctors have joined the protests launched by junior doctors, they have not staged a walkout from their jobs. A strike from senior doctors would be a big blow to South Korea’s healthcare system.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Sunday urged senior doctors to persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.

Why are doctors protesting?
The protests were fueled after the government announced its plan to increase the number of students admitted to medical school in a bid to bolster the healthcare system of one of the world’s most rapidly aging societies.
The young doctors who are protesting say the government should first address pay and working conditions before trying to increase the number of physicians.

The U.S. and South Korea begin large military drills to boost readiness against North’s threats,"Open this photo in gallery: South Korean army soldiers pass by a military guard post at the Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, South Korea, near the border with North Korea, on July 19, 2023.Ahn Young-joon/The Associated Press
South Korea and the United States began large annual military exercises Monday to bolster their readiness against North Korean nuclear threats after the North raised animosities with an extension of missile tests and belligerent rhetoric earlier this year.
The South Korean and U.S. forces began a computer-simulated command post training called the Freedom Shield exercise and a variety of field exercises for an 11-day run, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.
North Korea had no immediate response to the major annual drills it regards as a rehearsal for invasion. The North has staged provocative weapons tests in the past in reaction to its adversaries’ joint drills.
South Korea’s military said last week that it would conduct 48 field exercises with the U.S. forces this spring, twice the number conducted last year, and that they would involve live-firing, bombing, air assault and missile interception drills.
Since early 2022, North Korea has conducted more than 100 rounds of missile tests to modernize its arsenal as talks with the United States and South Korea have been stalled for an extended period. In response, the United States and South Korea have expanded their training exercises and increased the deployment of powerful U.S military assets such as aircraft carriers and long-range nuclear-capable bombers.
This year, North Korea carried out six rounds of missile tests and barrage of artillery firing drills. Its leader Kim Jong Un also said North Korea would scrap its long-standing goal of peaceful unification with South Korea and take a more aggressive military posture along the disputed sea boundary with South Korea. He also vowed to “annihilate” South Korea and the United States if provoked, a threat that he had previously issued.
The North Korean steps raised worries that it might make provocations along the tense Korean sea and land borders. But experts say the prospect for a full-blown attack by North Korea is dim as the North knows its military is outmatched by U.S. and South Korean forces.
North Korea’s moves to raise tensions are likely related to upcoming elections planned by its rivals: the U.S. presidential election in November and South Korea’s parliament election in April. North Korea believes an advanced nuclear arsenal will increase its leverage in future diplomacy and it can win concessions like the easing of international sanctions, experts say.",2024-03-04T03:38:34Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail

The U.S. and South Korean armies began its spring drills on Monday, according to authorities, with twice as many troops participating as the previous year. The goal is for the allies to be better equipped to fight North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats.
The Freedom Shield drills, scheduled for March 4–14, coincide with North Korea’s ongoing efforts to test missiles and other weapons in order to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. It will also be the first since November 2018, when Pyongyang called off an inter-Korean military agreement.

The defence ministry in Seoul said on Monday that the allied air forces had begun their yearly, battalion-level Ssangmae exercises, which would last for five days.
Freedom Shield will involve twice the number of troops from both sides compared with last year in 48 rounds of combined field training, including air assault and air strikes, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
The exercises are primarily aimed at neutralising North Korea’s nuclear threats, including by “identifying and striking” cruise missiles, which Pyongyang had indicated could carry nuclear warheads, JCS spokesperson Colonel Lee Sung-jun said.
A nuclear attack scenario will be integrated into summertime drills, he added.
American strategic assets such as an aircraft carrier and bombers could participate, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. U.S. Forces Korea said such assets will likely be deployed in line with past practices but declined to elaborate citing security protocol.

South Korea to start legal action against doctors over walkout,"SEOUL - South Korea’s Health Minister said on March 4 that the authorities will start inspecting hospitals in order to take legal action against trainee doctors who have ignored an ultimatum to end a walkout over government plans to increase medical school admissions.
Around 9,000 resident and intern doctors, or about 70 per cent of the country's total, have walked off the job since Feb 20, leading to the cancellation of some surgical procedures and treatments, and straining emergency departments.
The government had warned the protesting trainee physicians that they could face administrative and legal penalties, including the suspension of their medical licences and fines, or a jail term if they did not return to work by the end of February.
“From today, we plan to conduct on-site inspections to confirm trainee doctors who have not returned, and take action according to the law and principle without exception,” Health Minister Cho Kyoo-hong told a televised briefing.
“Please keep in mind that doctors who have not returned may experience serious problems in their personal career path.”
For protesting doctors who returned to the field, Mr Choo said the government would consider extenuating circumstances when contemplating any action against them.
Later, Vice-Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing that the government would take steps to suspend the medical licences of some 7,000 trainee doctors who had left their jobs.
Up to now, there has been little sign of either side backing down. Thousands of South Korean doctors held a mass rally on March 3 organised by the Korean Medical Association, which represents private practitioners, defying official calls for the trainee physicians to return to work.
The World Medical Association, a group representing physicians, said in a statement on March 3 that it “strongly condemns the actions of the Korean government in attempting to stifle the voices of elected leaders within the Korean Medical Association”, adding that it affirmed the right of doctors to collective action, including strikes.
The young doctors who are protesting say the government should first address pay and working conditions before trying to increase the number of physicians.",2024-03-04T02:45:31Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
"South Korea, US troops kick off annual drills over North threats","South Korean and U.S. militaries kicked off their spring drills on Monday with twice the number of troops joining compared to last year, officials said, as the allies seek to better counter North Korea's increasing nuclear and missile threats.
The Freedom Shield exercises, set for March 4-14, come as North Korea continues to develop its nuclear capabilities with missile and other weapons tests. It will also be first since Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military pact in November. The allies' air forces also began their annual, battalion-level Ssangmae exercises for a five-day run, Seoul's defence ministry said Monday.
Freedom Shield will involve twice the number of troops from both sides compared with last year in 48 rounds of combined field training, including air assault and air strikes, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. The exercises are primarily aimed at neutralising North Korea's nuclear threats, including by ""identifying and striking"" cruise missiles, which Pyongyang had indicated could carry nuclear warheads, JCS spokesperson Colonel Lee Sung-jun said.
A nuclear attack scenario will be integrated into summertime drills, he added. American strategic assets such as an aircraft carrier and bombers could participate, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. U.S. Forces Korea said such assets will likely be deployed in line with past practices but declined to elaborate citing security protocol.
""Strategic"" is a term often used to describe nuclear forces. Pyongyang has angrily reacted to the allies' drills, calling them rehearsals for a nuclear war.
Seoul and Washington say the exercises are defensive and a response to the North's threats.

SEOUL – South Korea and the United States began large annual military exercises Monday to bolster their readiness against North Korean nuclear threats after the North raised animosities with an extension of missile tests and belligerent rhetoric earlier this year.
The South Korean and U.S. forces began a computer-simulated command post training called the Freedom Shield exercise and a variety of field exercises for an 11-day run, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.

North Korea had no immediate response to the major annual drills it regards as a rehearsal for invasion. The North has staged provocative weapons tests in the past in reaction to its adversaries' joint drills.
South Korea’s military said last week that it would conduct 48 field exercises with the U.S. forces this spring, twice the number conducted last year, and that they would involve live-firing, bombing, air assault and missile interception drills.
Since early 2022, North Korea has conducted more than 100 rounds of missile tests to modernize its arsenal as talks with the United States and South Korea have been stalled for an extended period. In response, the United States and South Korea have expanded their training exercises and increased the deployment of powerful U.S military assets such as aircraft carriers and long-range nuclear-capable bombers.
This year, North Korea carried out six rounds of missile tests and barrage of artillery firing drills. Its leader Kim Jong Un also said North Korea would scrap its long-standing goal of peaceful unification with South Korea and take a more aggressive military posture along the disputed sea boundary with South Korea. He also vowed to “annihilate” South Korea and the United States if provoked, a threat that he had previously issued.
The North Korean steps raised worries that it might make provocations along the tense Korean sea and land borders. But experts say the prospect for a full-blown attack by North Korea is dim as the North knows its military is outmatched by U.S. and South Korean forces.
North Korea’s moves to raise tensions are likely related to upcoming elections planned by its rivals: the U.S. presidential election in November and South Korea's parliament election in April. North Korea believes an advanced nuclear arsenal will increase its leverage in future diplomacy and it can win concessions like the easing of international sanctions, experts say.

The New Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Line Has More Buttons And A Rear Wiper,"The Ioniq 5 doesn't really need a facelift since it still looks like a concept even though it has been in production for three years. Nevertheless, Hyundai's first dedicated electric car is getting a nip and tuck for 2024 in South Korea, with other regions to follow shortly. Let's take a look at what has changed because the updates are subtle.
Going forward, an N Line version will bridge the gap between the regular Ioniq 5 trim levels and the high-performance N. It follows the strategy used by Hyundai for its conventionally powered models by adopting a slightly sportier-looking body kit without extra performance. The all-show-without-extra-go flavor has different bumpers, side skirts, and 20-inch wheels in a fresh design. You can easily figure out which is which by the ""fangs"" at the front and the ""N Line"" badge on the grille.

Hyundai is also giving the standard Ioniq 5 a nip and tuck with a mildly updated grille and reshaped bumpers. While the width, height, and wheelbase are carried over, the EV is 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) longer after remodeling the bumpers. In addition, the rear spoiler has been widened by 50 mm (1.97 in) and there are newly designed wheels to choose from. Oh, there's finally a rear wiper – a feature we saw coming since the Ioniq 5 N already has it.
The interior may seem more of the same but Hyundai is giving it more buttons. Much like the Tucson has additional physical controls, the Ioniq 5 gets extra shortcuts to often-used features. There's a row of buttons to quickly turn on the heated and ventilated front seats, the heated steering wheel, and the parking assist function. You can find the controls at the top of the Universal Island, which is marketing jargon for the sliding central console.
There are other changes in that area since the wireless charging pad is more accessible after bringing it closer to the driver and front passenger. It sits to the left of the cup holders, which are now vertically arranged. Hyundai also tweaked the climate controls on the dashboard and put interactive pixel lights on the steering wheel.
Step up to the N Line version and you get extra goodies such as sports seats, a black headliner, red stitching, two-tone upholstery, and a different look for the steering wheel and dashboard. Owners will be able to remotely fold the second row of seats
Elsewhere, the new-ish Ioniq 5 has a revamped infotainment with over-the-air updates, upgraded safety tech, reinforced doors and B-pillars, and higher body stiffness. Hyundai changed the dampers to reduce vibrations felt in the steering wheel and it doubled the reinforcements at the back and underneath the car to lower noise. Moreover, the rear motor has extra sound insulation than before for a quieter cabin. Inherited from the Ioniq 5 N, the regular model now has the bigger 84-kWh battery pack, up from 77.4 kWh.
The updated Ioniq 5 and the new Ioniq 5 N Line will go on sale this month in South Korea before arriving in global markets later in 2024.",2024-03-03T18:30:00Z,https://www.motor1.com,Motor1 
Jesse Lingard 'blessed and grateful' after finally making debut in South Korea even though it didn't go to plan,"Jesse Lingard said he was ‘blessed and grateful’ to be back on the pitch as he made his debut in South Korea.
Lingard came off the bench for new club FC Seoul on Saturday, but things did not go quite to plan.

His side lost 2-0 to Gwangju and his impact after coming on didn’t go exactly to plan.
Within 15 minutes of him coming off the bench, he earned the first booking of his career in Asia - being dealt a yellow card for a flying tackle that really could have been much worse.
Lingard was announced as an FC Seoul player at the start of February, but had to wait nearly a month before making his debut.
Taking to Instagram after the final whistle, he wrote: ""Blessed and grateful to be back on the pitch doing what I love best.""
Lingard spent nearly seven months without a club after leaving Nottingham Forest in the summer and took his time over his next move.
The 31-year-old signed a two-year-deal with the K-League side with the option of a further year and is believed to be earning around £17,000-a-week.
I just want to enjoy playing football again, putting a smile on people’s faces and showing Korean fans what I can do,"" he said after signing for the club.

"""Schwarzer Donnerstag"" - wie die Sowjets die ""Superfestungen"" der US-Luftwaffe vom Himmel holten","Die MiG-15 konnte 4000 Meter höher als die B-29 und ihr Jagdschutz fliegen und sich so in eine perfekte Angriffsposition bringen.
von Gernot Kramper Die Piloten der US-Airforce beherrschten unangefochten den Himmel – bis ihnen Stalins Piloten in MiG-15 Jets über Korea entgegentraten und den Amerikanern demütigende Niederlagen bescherten.
Der Westen geht gern davon aus, dass die Jets und Piloten der USA denen Russlands überlegen sind. Wirkliche Kämpfe finden seit Jahrzehnten nicht statt. Doch schon im Zweiten Weltkrieg sieht die Liste der erfolgreichsten Jagdpiloten anders aus. Kein alliierter Pilot reicht an Erich Hartmann (352 Abschüsse), Gerhard Barkhorn (301 Luftsiege) oder Günther Rall (301) heran und die erfolgreichsten alliierten Jäger kommen auch nicht aus dem Westen. Es sind Piloten der Roten Armee. Nikolay Dmitrievich Gulayev verbuchte 60 Luftsiege, Aleksandr Ivanovich Pokryshkin 59. Der beste Pilot der USA, Richard Bong, schoss 40 japanische Flugzeuge ab.
Im Zweiten Weltkrieg kämpften Sowjets und Amerikaner noch auf einer Seite, über der koreanischen Halbinsel sollten sie sich wieder begegnen. Und das Treffen endete mit einem Schock für die USA. Ein besonders traumatisches Ereignis war der ""Schwarze Donnerstag"", der 12. April 1951. Um Verluste an Bodentruppen zu vermeiden, setzten die USA auf großflächige Bombardements. Dazu starteten drei Staffeln von B-29 Superfortress-Bombern. Die B-29 war der modernste Bomber des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Mit Maschinen dieses Typs wurden die Atombomben über Hiroshima und Nagasaki abgeworfen. 1945 konnten Jäger und Flak die Maschine wegen ihrer Flughöhe praktisch nicht angreifen. Über Korea und sechs Jahre später war die Air Force vorsichtiger. Der Bomberpulk wurde von etwa hundert Jägern der Typen F-80 Shooting Star und F-84 beschützt.
Erstes Jet-Gefecht der Geschichte
Denn die Amerikaner waren gewarnt. Wenige Monate zuvor trafen am 1. November 1950 zehn amerikanische F-80 auf drei sowjetische MiG-15, eine Maschine musste bereits wegen Spritmangels zum Flughafen zurückkehren. Die Sowjets konnten die US-Piloten ausmanövrieren. Leutnant Semjon Chominitsch griff allein die Führungsgruppe an und schoss eine F-80 ab. Der Pilot Major Frank L. Van Sickle starb. Zwei weitere F-80 wurden beschädigt, aber die Russen mussten den Kampf wegen des Treibstoffs abbrechen. Das erste Gefecht von Düsenjägern überhaupt endete mit einer klaren Niederlage für die USA.
Der Bomberschwarm des ""Schwarzen Donnerstags"" wurde von drei Staffeln MiG-15 attackiert. Nur 30 Jäger stürzten sich auf den Verband mit fast 140 Flugzeugen. Unter den Piloten waren trainierte Veteranen des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Sergey Makarovich Kramarenko schoss eine F-84 Thunderjet ab. Er hatte sich als Unterstützer für die Sache Nordkoreas gemeldet, erinnerte er sich als alter Mann im russischen TV. Freiwillig, so wie alle anderen Piloten seiner Einheit. Offiziell nahm die UdSSR nicht am Krieg teil. Koreanische und chinesische Nationalkennzeichen wurden auf den Maschinen angebracht. Im Funk sollten sich die Piloten zur Tarnung mit koreanischen Codewörtern verständigen. Das klappte im Gefecht nicht, die Amerikaner wussten also, wer ihnen gegenüberstand.
Maschine einer neuen Ära
Die US-Jäger der Typen F-80 Shooting Star und F-84 Thunderjet waren der sowjetischen MiG-15 deutlich unterlegen. Anders sah es mit der F-86 Sabre aus, sie war wendiger, aber schwächer bewaffnet als die MiG-15, die eine höhere Feuerkraft besaß. Im Zweiten Weltkrieg hatten die Bomberpulks der USA Deutschland in Schutt und Asche gelegt. Die Sowjets hatten daher geübt, wie man solche Bomberflotten ausschalten konnte. Als Abfangjäger konzipiert konnte die MiG-15 schneller und höher steigen als die US-Jets. Sie konnte 4000 Meter mehr erreichen als eine F-84. Die Russen stießen nun in Gruppenattacken von oben auf den Bomberpulk der B-29 herab. Im Tauchen erreichten sie eine Geschwindigkeit, bei der die US-Jäger nicht mithalten konnten.
Die schwerfälligen Bomber waren ein leichtes Ziel, so Kramarenko. Er nennt sie ""fliegende Scheunen"", nur der Jagdschutz musste zerstreut werden. Am schwarzen Donnerstag sollten sich die besten Piloten um die Jäger kümmern. ""Ich identifizierte das Flugzeug des Kommandanten im Thunderjet-Geschwader und eröffnete das Feuer. Eine Salve verlief hinter dem Heck des amerikanischen Flugzeugs, die zweite traf genau das Ziel. Die F-84 fing an zu rauchen und begann zu fallen. Dann fingern wir an, die US-Jäger zu verfolgen, die versuchten, aus dem Kampf herauszukommen. Ihre Piloten konnten nicht mehr daran denken, die Bomber zu schützen.""

B-29 steckte Beschuss ein
""Wir flogen über den Bombern. Die MiGs eröffneten das Feuer gegen ""Superfestungen"". Eine B-29 verlor einen Flügel, das Flugzeug zerbrach in Teile. Drei oder vier Flugzeuge fingen Feuer. Die Besatzungen verließen die Flugzeuge. Dutzende Fallschirme hingen in der Luft. Der Kampf bekam gerade Fahrt ... einige Besatzungen kehrten um. Vier weitere Festungen stürzten hin, sie schafften es nicht bis zur Heimatbasis.""
Nur eins rettete die überlebenden Bomberpiloten. Die B-29 konnte sehr viele Treffer der Maschinenkanonen einstecken, bevor sie abstürzte. ""Ein Flugzeug hatte hundert Löcher. Aber es gab keinen ernsthaften Schaden, keine einzige Kugel traf die Nase mit dem Cockpit.""
Ohne eigene Verluste schossen die Sowjets die schweren Bomber aus dem Verband heraus. Solange bis sie das Meer und den rettenden Flakschutz der US-Navy erreicht hatten. Die UdSSR reklamiert 12 abgeschossene Bomber und fünf US-Jäger, die USA gaben drei Totalverluste und sieben schwer beschädigte Maschinen an.

Wende durch Stalin
Entlang der Einsatzzone der MiG-Jäger über dem Fluss Yalu kam es immer wieder zu Gefechten. Am ""Schwarzen Dienstag"", dem 23. Oktober 1951, trafen sich die Piloten beider Seiten zur größten Luftschlacht nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Im September begannen die Sowjets weiter südlich gelegene Flugfelder für ihre Jets anzulegen, das hätte deren Einsatzbereich erweitert. Also sollten die neu angelegten Flugfelder der MiGs zerstört werden, bevor sie betriebsbereit sein würden. Nachtangriffe blieben erfolglos, daher sollten neun B-29 die Mission mit starkem Jagdschutz durchführen. Doch MiG-15 tauchten in großer Zahl auf, nur sechs von neun B-29 Bombern schafften es zurück nach Okinawa. Niemals zuvor hatte die US-Luftwaffe einen so hohen Prozentsatz an Bombern bei nur einem Einsatz verloren. Das Blatt im Himmel über Korea wendete sich erst, als Stalin befahl, die eigenen Piloten zurückzuziehen und weit schlechter ausgebildete Piloten aus China und Korea die Maschinen übernahmen.

KB Financial Stock: Korea’s ‘Dividend King’ Trades At Too Steep A Discount,"Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images News
KB Financial Group (NYSE:KB) has set itself apart from Korea's other big banks in recent years - not only by diversifying into fee-related, non-bank businesses but also higher-growth Southeast Asian markets. The result is a diversified earnings base that has delivered steady growth despite a slower Korean economic backdrop. Recent Q4 reporting was more of the same, as despite the bank taking some big one-off provisions, strong non-bank profits kept the group bottom line well insulated. Also, positive was that new management has been consistent in its shareholder return focus, setting out a clear path to even higher payouts in 2024.
To be clear, KB Financial isn't completely out of the asset quality woods just yet, but its best-in-class capital position and the prospect of rate cuts later this year should keep the group well on track to meet its targets. Relative to a sustained high-single-digit % return on equity profile, the bank's current ~60% book value discount offers a compelling entry point, particularly with a big corporate reform ('value up') catalyst on the horizon.
Data by YCharts
Clearing the Deck in Q4; Path to Higher Shareholder Returns Intact
For the most part, KB Financial has continued to post resilient earnings numbers through a challenging period. Q4 2023 was more of a 'kitchen sinking' quarter, though, as some very significant provisioning led to a below-par net income result. Adjusted for one-offs, on the other hand, the group maintains impressively resilient underlying fundamentals, particularly on the non-bank side, where rising profits from the securities and insurance subsidiaries have helped massively. In contrast, the core banking business is stalling out, as a combination of peaking interest rates and higher funding cost pressures led to a slight drop in net interest margins. Still, the relative NIM defensiveness stands out relative to peers, many of which saw their margins peak far earlier. The higher non-bank contribution is another key differentiator, in that it adds a defensive element to KB Financial's otherwise rate-sensitive earnings base.
KB Financial
Looking past the headline earnings number, though, management's full-year shareholder return payout, comprising both buybacks and cash dividends, was (rightly) well-received by the market. Note that the 2023 payout is up five to six percentage points from 2022, with the buyback portion almost doubled this time around. The announcement was also significant in that it erased any lingering doubts about strategic continuity under new CEO (and former Vice President) Yang Jong Hee, who only just took the helm late last year. Even after upsizing the capital return, there remains capital headroom for more returns going forward (CET1 well above the 13% minimum, including a stress buffer.), so a >40% total shareholder payout may well be on the cards for 2024.
KB Financial
Asset Quality Overhang Easing; Upcoming Rate Pivot to Further Alleviate Pressure
Provisions may have been sharply higher, but the group's non-performing loan ratio increased by a very modest ~8bps sequentially, while delinquency rates actually dropped relative to last quarter. So even if we do see a non-performing loan ratio spike sometime in the future (vs. the currently low 0.8% level), the bank should be well-covered. For now, though, I see KB Financial's two major asset quality risks, from equity-linked securities (tied to Chinese indices that have suffered heavy losses) and property, as very manageable. Yes, KB Financial has more China equity-linked securities exposure than other banks and could well face the regulatory music down the line. But in light of the Chinese equity resurgence over the last month, the bank could get away with a smaller fine than many expect. And on the real estate financing front, exposure is more limited and higher quality (think better terms and better collateral) than the smaller lenders, many of which will bear the brunt.
KB Financial
Perhaps the biggest asset quality tailwind, though, is that the Korean central bank, the Bank of Korea (the BoK), looks poised for interest rate cuts later this year. Fundamentally, the case for a pivot is compelling - in addition to a series of disinflationary monthly prints and the prospect of easing supply-side pressures globally, Korea has seen slower growth, particularly on the domestic consumption side. In the likely event we see inflation converge with the BOK's 2% target soon, I wouldn't be surprised to see a more aggressive monetary easing path than many expect.
Beyond addressing the asset quality overhang, non-interest income gains from the securities portfolio will also be worth keeping an eye on, as one-offs here could spring some upside surprises in a declining rate environment. So for the near term at least, KB Financial will probably be a net beneficiary of lower rates - despite a likely initial hit to net interest margins.
Bloomberg
Korea's 'Dividend King' Trades at Too Steep a Discount
KB Financial may have re-rated in recent weeks on the heels of a resilient quarter and a smooth CEO transition, but the risk/reward remains very attractive here. Not only is this among the very best dividend plays in Korea at the current mid-single-digit % yield, but it also has a clear path to an increased payout (buybacks and dividends) in 2024. Meanwhile, concerns about asset quality, even if warranted to some extent, are more than accounted for in the ~60% book value discount. Inversely, the market is assigning little value to KB Financial's capital adequacy nor to its diversified earnings base, which should quite easily support the capital return story through the cycles. Ahead of a catalyst-rich next few months, featuring potential rate cuts in H2 and a market-wide 'value up' program to narrow the 'Korea discount,' there's still plenty to like here.",2024-03-03T14:19:40Z,https://seekingalpha.com,Seeking Alpha
Thousands of South Korean doctors stage mass demonstration in Seoul,"CNN —
Thousands of doctors in South Korea took to the streets of Seoul on Sunday to protest the government’s plans to increase medical school admissions and what they see as a broader lack of support for the country’s medical system.
The doctors say the government needs to address a wider range of challenges facing the healthcare system than just the total number of doctors trained per year.
Their concerns include staffing in specific fields and the price the government pays for essential medical treatments as well as establishing a proper infrastructure for educating large numbers of new medical students.
The government’s plan, announced in February, will increase the number of students admitted to medical schools by 2,000 starting in the 2025 academic year which would bring the total to 5,000 per year.
Trainee doctors are also angry over difficult working conditions that include low pay and long hours.
Around 8,000 trainee doctors in South Korea began striking on February 21 by submitting their resignation. A further 1,000 have resigned since then.

The move comes in a bid to meet the changing healthcare demands of one of the world’s fastest aging societies and to boost access in rural areas of the country, according to the government.
The number of child care facilities in the country has shrunk by almost a quarter in just a few years, CNN reported in July, reflecting authorities’ unsuccessful campaign to encourage couples to have more babies.
Meanwhile, as the population rapidly ages, the number of elderly facilities has boomed from 76,000 in 2017 to 89,643 in 2022, according to the country’s health and welfare ministry.
Compounding the challenge, South Korea has the world’s lowest birth rate, which has been falling continuously since 2015.
On Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said his government would not back down on its plans.
“Protecting people such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities is directly linked to the government’s core policy on welfare for the vulnerable populations in healthcare. Therefore, this [medical reform] is not a matter for negotiations or compromise,” he said at a press conference.
According to a recent Gallup poll, 76% of respondents favoured expanding medical school admissions.
On Thursday, the government issued a back-to-work order, warning striking doctors their medical licenses could be suspended if they did not comply.
Despite the deadline, a representative for South Korea’s doctors said they supported the walkout and would continue to push for their demands to be met.
In an effort to continue to provide healthcare during the strike, the government has drafted in military doctors and nurses have been given legal protection to perform some medical procedures normally conducted by doctors, according to the health ministry.

"Young Matildas playing in snow, video, reaction, Korea Republic game","The Young Matildas kicked off their AFC U20 Women’s Asian Cup campaign in Uzbekistan on Sunday night against Korea Republic in unconventional circumstances, to put it kindly.
Australia and Korea Republic were met with testing conditions after snow blanketed the field, with an attempt made to clear at least parts of the pitch for the players from both teams.
Although the best that could be managed was just the sides and sections of the centre circle, with players left to make futile attempts to pass the ball which instead continually got stuck in the snow.

The weather conditions in Tashkent weren’t necessarily unexpected with Amy Sayer, who plays club football for Kristianstads DFF in Sweden, explaining to the Matildas’ official website before the game how cold climate — and potentially snow — could impact play.
“It takes a lot of mental fortitude to push through that [the weather],” she said.
“There will be some differences in how the ball rolls, how the field feels to us.
“But I think that the strength of this team is so great. We can really push through any condition, whether it’s two feet of snow or whatever else Uzbekistan might throw at us.”
Australia last played Korea Republic in the most recent edition of the tournament, going down 9-1, and trailed 1-0 at halftime on Sunday evening after a goal from Jeon Yu-gyeong.
But they fought back brilliantly after the break, with Peta Trimis levelling the scores in the 73rd minute before a 90th minute winner from Naomi Chinnama.

Fertility rates are falling in the rich world. But there are still plenty of people to go round,"‘It’s funny, but it’s dark, because we know we could be causing our own extinction.” That was the sardonic response of one single 30-year-old South Korean, to a BBC reporter, to the data released last week that showed her country has the lowest fertility rate ever recorded. On average, women in South Korea are now having only 0.72 children. For a country to have a stable population, that number needs to be a little over 2. A little over because not all children reach mid-adulthood, anywhere in the world.
In South Korea, the fall in babies has occurred despite successive governments spending £226bn over the past 20 years trying to incentivise women to have more children. The BBC story focused on the trade-offs of having a career or a family, the excessive costs of private education and the competitive misery of growing up in South Korean society. However, not once, in the 2,500-word story, did the words “inequality”, “poverty” or “destitution” appear. It might be that such words are now no longer welcomed in copy for a public broadcaster that represents Europe’s most unequal large country (by income). Or it might just be that we tend to think of these issues as being the aggregate of millions of individual choices not to have children, rather than part of a wider story.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) produces and updates income inequality statistics continuously, the latest of which reports that South Korea is the 11th most unequal country of all those that it surveys. But there is no simple correlation between economic inequality in a country and the number of children people have. Israel (10th) is fractionally more unequal than Korea, yet has a fertility rate of 2.9.
The UK is even more unequal, ranking eighth in inequality, with a fertility rate of 1.6. The USA is the fifth most unequal state in the affluent world, and yet the number of children people have there is higher, at 1.7.
Why, then, is the fertility rate in South Korea so low? French media suggest that the burden of “carrying out the brunt of household chores” is a key factor. Al Jazeera points to South Korea having “one of the worst gender pay gaps” in the OECD. Reuters chose to highlight that “Japan’s fertility rate hit a record low of 1.26 in 2022, while China recorded 1.09, also a record low.” And the Guardian, a couple of weeks before the latest story broke, reminded its readers that “Britain’s birth rate is the lowest it has been in two decades”, pointing out that everything from “cultural Marxism” to “millennial narcissism” was being blamed.
We do not operate purely in the statistical silos of the borders of nation states
What no one said, and what should be said, is that we are not alone on this planet. There are eight billion of us now and yet all these stories repeatedly focus only on events going on within the richest of nations – as if the rest of us, or the rest of nature, did not exist.
The world as a whole passed the dramatic “peak baby” moment a very long time ago, in 1990. The children that those babies produced created a further peak, but it was barely any higher than that earlier one. Today, the United Nations projections show that we will not see such large peaks again. Our total numbers will, from here on, rise ever more slowly, and almost entirely because we are now living longer.
Current projections also suggest that in the year 2086, our number will fall for the first time not due to calamity. This peak human date will be a momentous point in the history of a very young species.
It is beyond my ability to explain quite how the young women and men of the affluent world know that there are now enough of us on this planet. But clearly most know that there are enough youngsters living elsewhere that if we only stopped trying to “stop the boats”, or dog-whistling about “poisoning the blood”, there would be enough of us to go around, everywhere, for all our futures.
We have always expressed shock when births fall. But they have to, for humans, eventually
Young adults appear to know we should slow down, at least subconsciously, almost everywhere outside war zones. It is not concerns about climate disaster, artificial intelligence or any other relatively recent existential fears that are causing this. We know this because the slowdown in the number of babies being born in places such as Korea, Japan and Europe began many decades ago. We have always expressed shock when births fall. But they have to, for humans, eventually. South Korea is mostly just the extreme edge of that trend. And it is there, at that edge, because it is almost entirely urban.
We do not operate purely in the statistical silos of the borders of nation states. Our behaviour is affected by everything else happening in the world. The number of babies being born per woman has been falling almost everywhere worldwide, for many decades now; but the number of children we collectively have is enough. There are no new worlds to be populated, and we are more aware today of the implications of trying to settle others’ lands than we have ever been.
In short – we are not alone. We live in crowded cities spread over a planet that hosts enough people and does not need a great deal more. We have developed social security systems that, if we are careful, should care for us in old age so we do not need the insurance of an additional child. And, above all else, women, especially in the more affluent countries, are more and more able to say no to what the government, with all their billions of pounds of incentives, might suggest.",2024-03-03T08:00:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

S.Korea factory activity extends gains but demand slows,"Published Mar 03, 2024 07:37PM ET
By Jihoon Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity expanded for a second straight month in February but at a slower pace due to weakening overseas demand, especially in Europe and China, a private-sector survey showed on Monday.
The purchasing managers index (PMI) for South Koreanmanufacturers, compiled by S&P Global, stood at 50.7 in Februaryon a seasonally adjusted basis, down from 51.2 in January.
The fall came after the index rose above the 50-mark, which separates expansion from contraction, for the first time in 19 months in January.
""PMI data for February indicated a further improvement in operating conditions midway through the first quarter,"" saidUsamah Bhatti, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
""Both output and new orders continued to expand, albeit at softer rates than those seen in January.""
Overseas demand for South Korean goods broadly stalled in February, as stronger demand in the United States, Southeast Asia and the Middle East was offset by weaker sales in Europe and Mainland China, according to the survey.
New export orders rose only marginally, with the sub-index down to 50.3 from 52.4 in January, which was the highest since February 2022.
Separate data earlier this month showed growth in South Korea's exports was weaker in February than in January but stronger if adjusted for working-day differences, as a surge in semiconductor demand made up for a decline in vehicle sales.
Amid growing demand, the backlog of work rose in February for the first time since October 2022 with manufacturers using up stocks at the fastest pace since December 2022.
Employment rose at the fastest pace in four months, the survey showed.
Suppliers' delivery times worsened for the seventh straight month, with survey respondents blaming logistical disruptions in the Red Sea and staff shortages, although the rate of deterioration has slowed.
Manufacturers' optimism for future output remained buoyant but weakened slightly in February, as some firms were still concerned about the timing of an economic recovery.",2024-03-03T05:00:00Z,https://www.investing.com,Investing.com
Samsung Galaxy Ring may last for almost ten days,"What you need to know
After being teased at a Galaxy Unpacked event, the Galaxy Ring was officially showcased at MWC 2024.
The Galaxy ring will be Samsung’s first attempt at a smart ring and will compete against the likes of the Oura Ring.
A definitive release date is yet to be confirmed by Samsung, but it is likely to be later this year.
After finally giving us a close-up look at the Galaxy Ring at MWC, we confirmed several new details about Samsung's device, which is set to compete with other smart rings such as the Oura Ring. And while we were able to get a look at the style and colors the new ring will offer, as well as a few other insights, there’s still plenty of information Samsung has yet to confirm.
It appears that one mystery may have been solved thanks to recent briefings given to Korean news outlets. According to those reports (via Android Authority) the Galaxy Ring looks like it will last over a week between charges.
According to the Korean outlet Financial News, Dr Hon Pak, head of the digital health team at Samsung, told reporters at a briefing that the Galaxy Ring battery lasts for about five to nine days. This was echoed in a report by TechM, which quotes Samsung Electronics President Roh Tae-moon as saying,“it [the Galaxy Ring] can be used without the need for recharge for up to nine days.”
(Image credit: Samsung)
According to a report from CNET, the Galaxy Ring battery will vary in size depending on the size of the ring itself. According to that report, the smallest Galaxy Ring will have a 14.5 mAh capacity, while the largest will have a 21.5 mAh battery. It isn’t clear, however, exactly how that will translate into real-life battery performance, although it might indicate that a smaller Galaxy Ring will be closer to five days than nine, and vice versa for a larger ring.
Five to nine days would put the Galaxy Ring firmly in line with, or slightly ahead of, other smart rings. The Oura Ring claims a battery life of up to seven days, while the Ultrahuman Ring lasts four to six days between charges.
While we don’t yet know for certain how long the battery life will be, it appears we won’t have to wait too long to find out. A Galaxy Ring teaser from earlier this year seemed to hint at a release in the second half of 2024, while another report from Korea points to a release “in the second half of this year”.
We contacted Samsung to seek verification of these claims. They simply said, “it's still under development and not final.”",2024-03-01T18:00:28Z,https://www.androidcentral.com,Android Central
PH deploys 1st batch of seasonal workers to South Korea,"THIRTY-NINE overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) have been deployed to South Korea as part of the first batch of those employed under the Seasonal Work Program (SWP) after the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) issued its interim pipeline processing guidelines.
In a statement, the DMW reported that 39 seasonal farm workers have been deployed with the help of their local government units (LGUs) in Pampanga.
""A total of 39 seasonal farm workers from the towns of Apalit, Lubao, and Magalang were deployed to work in South Korea last Thursday,"" said the DMW.
""This is the first batch of seasonal farm workers that were able to depart under the interim pipeline processing guidelines of the DMW,"" it added.
The department said the deployment was made possible after the OFWs underwent the mandatory Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar (PDOS).
The DMW also issued the OFWs with Special Exit Clearance for their deployment to South Korea.
The seasonal workers program allows short-term employment for agricultural workers in a bid to address labor shortages during the peak planting and harvesting season in South Korea.
Subsequently, the DMW has received complaints of physical abuse and other labor rights violations from deployed OFWs.
This prompted the DMW to issue a moratorium last January 11 that temporarily stopped the deployment of seasonal workers to South Korea.
In February, the DMW released an interim measure that shall facilitate the pipeline processing of qualified seasonal workers. (HDT/SunStar Philippines)",2024-03-01T16:02:34Z,https://www.sunstar.com.ph,SunStar Philippines

US and Ally Announce Major Military Exercise With Eye on Kim's North Korea,"The U.S. and South Korea are to launch a major military exercise against the backdrop of North Korea's aggressive moves on the Korean Peninsula.
The Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States are set to conduct the Freedom Shield 2024 (FS24), an extensive 11-day military exercise from March 4 to March 14, aimed at bolstering the combined defense capabilities of the allied forces, United States Forces Korea (USFK), a sub-unified command of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said on February 27.
Freedom Shield is a large-scale semiannual military training conducted throughout South Korea.
The exercise comes as tensions have once again escalated on the Korean Peninsula after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un abandoned efforts to repair the fractious ties with South Korea. In January, Kim abolished three bodies related to inter-Korean cooperation and amended the country's the country's constitution, naming Seoul as Pyongyang's ""principal enemy.""
United States Forces Korea said in a statement that the latest exercise will help with ""ensuring their ability to fortify the combined defense posture and enhance Alliance response capabilities against a spectrum of security threats.""
""It will feature live, virtual, constructive and field-based training, engaging personnel from the military services and other federal agencies,"" USFK said in a statement on February 27.
USFK said the annual event is designed to enhance interoperability and readiness across various security threats, reflecting a comprehensive approach within the Korea Theater of Operations, encompassing combined, joint, multi-domain, and interagency efforts.
The FS24 exercise underscores the commitment between the Combined Forces Command, United States Forces Korea, the United Nations Command, and the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to solidify the allied defense posture and improve response capabilities, it added.
The training will incorporate live, virtual, constructive, and field-based drills involving military personnel and other federal agencies.
""One key aspect of the training event focuses on conducting multi-domain operations leveraging land, sea, air, cyber, and space assets with an emphasis on counter nuclear operations and non-kinetic effects,"" USFK said.
The FS24 will see participation from service members across 12 UN Command Member States, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and the U.S., contributing additional personnel, USFK said. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will also observe the exercises to ensure adherence to the Armistice Agreement.
Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Col. Lee Sung-jun underscored the scope of the exercise during a press briefing in Seoul, noting the inclusion of 48 field training drills, which is double the number from the previous year.
""There will be a variety of combined field training drills on land, sea, and in the air to increase interoperability and enhance the combined operation capabilities of the alliance,"" JCS spokesperson Col. Lee Sung-jun said in a joint press briefing at the Defense Ministry.
Amid the backdrop of these planned exercises, the top diplomats of South Korea and the United States, Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, met in Washington on Wednesday, according to U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.
""We are one in condemning North Korea's increasingly provocative rhetoric and actions that violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions, including its export of munitions and ballistic missiles to Russia,"" Foreign Minister Cho said during a press availability in Washington on Wednesday.

North Korea's first spy satellite is 'alive', can manoeuvre, expert says
North Korea's first spy satellite is ""alive"", space experts said on Tuesday, after detecting changes in its orbit that suggested Pyongyang was successfully controlling the spacecraft - although its capabilities remain unknown. After two fiery failures, North Korea successfully launched the Malligyong-1 satellite into orbit in November. Pyongyang's state media claimed it has photographed sensitive military and political sites in South Korea, the United States and elsewhere, but has not released any imagery. Independent radio trackers have not detected signals from the satellite.

People with tails? No, because of this ancient genetic mutation
Director James Cameron's ""Avatar"" movies are populated by a species of outsized blue beings resembling humans, except with tails. So why does our species lack a tail, considering that our evolutionary forerunners in the primate lineage had them? Scientists on Wednesday identified what might be the genetic mechanism behind the tailless condition of us and our ape ancestors - a mutation in a gene instrumental in embryonic development. The tail was a feature of most vertebrates for more than half a billion years, and its loss may have offered advantages as our ancestors moved from the trees to the ground, they said.

The company's Odysseus moon lander on Thursday ended its week-long mission near the lunar south pole after a mix of successes and failures that illustrated the type of risks the company and NASA, the mission's biggest backer, have come to embrace.
US moon lander Odysseus goes dormant a week after lopsided landing
Odysseus, the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the moon in half a century, lost power and went dormant on Thursday as it entered a frigid lunar nightfall, ending its mission a week after a lopsided touchdown that hindered operations and its scientific output. Intuitive Machines, the Texas-based aerospace company that NASA paid $118 million to build and fly Odysseus, said its ground control team had received a final ""farewell transmission"" from the spacecraft before it went dark on the moon's south pole region.

South Korea’s Yoon calls for unification,"SOUTH Korea’s president lambasted North Korea on Friday, March 1, 2024, over what he called its repressive rule and vowed to achieve a free, unified Korean Peninsula, weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rejected the idea of peaceful unification and threatened to occupy the South in the event of war.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol spoke on March 1 Independence Movement Day, a holiday marking a 1919 Korean uprising against Japanese colonial rule.
“Now, we must move toward a free, unified Korean Peninsula,” Yoon said in a televised speech. “The North Korean regime relies solely on nuclear weapons and missiles while trapping its 26 million citizens in a quagmire of misery and despair.”
“Unification is precisely what is needed to expand the universal values of freedom and human rights,” Yoon said. “Our unification efforts must become a source of hope and a beacon of light for the people of North Korea.”
Yoon and Kim’s conflicting comments on unification come after Korean animosities have run high for more than two years, with North Korea ramping up missile tests and South Korea expanding military drills with the U.S. in a tit-for-tat cycle.
For most of the 70 years since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, unification was a prized goal of leaders in both Koreas, which are divided by the world’s most heavily fortified border. But the prospects for unifying the rich, democratic South and the nominally socialist, authoritarian and poor North any time soon are extremely dim, observers say.
Despite extensive U.S.-led sanctions and its own economic mismanagement, North Korea has appeared politically stable.

North Korea's Spy Satellite Shows Signs of Life,"North Korea's spy satellite is ""alive,"" defying skeptics who believed the device was space debris, a Netherlands-based space expert says.
The satellite was tracked ""jumping"" to a higher orbit several times last month, showing North Korea can keep it from re-entering the atmosphere and extend its life, though its other capabilities are currently unknown.
North Korea said the Malligyong-1 spacecraft was operating successfully after two previous failed attempts at putting surveillance satellites in orbit. The country heralded the feat as a win that allows it to keep tabs on the ""military intention and moves of hostile forces.""
Pyongyang said its satellite has been snapping photos of the White House and Pentagon, though it has not made any of this imagery public.
As recently as Monday, South Korea's Defense Minister Shin Won-sik cast doubt on the Malligyong-1's capabilities, saying: ""It shows no signs of functioning and is merely orbiting without activity.""
Yet on February 19, the satellite had performed the first of a series of perigee burns, rising to a higher orbit, Marco Langbroek, aerospace engineering professor at Delft University, wrote in a blog, citing data from a satellite tracking station in Leiden, the Netherlands.
An object's perigee is the point in its orbit when it is closest to the earth.
""The perigee-raising maneuver shows that North Korea has control over the satellite, and it also means they can prolong its orbital lifetime by periodic orbit raises,"" Langbroek said in a blog post.
""The orbit raising maneuver comes a bit as a surprise, as the presence of an onboard propulsion system is unexpected. The previous two North Korean satellites never maneuvered,"" Langbroek wrote.

Newsweek reached out to the U.S. Space Command outside of business hours.
Washington and Seoul condemned the launch of the spacecraft as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions meant to curb Pyongyang's ballistic missile program.
Pyongyang, which has since pledged to put three more surveillance satellites in orbit by the end of 2024, has said it is exercising its right to self-defense.
The North Korean embassy in China did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
The launch and its aftermath further strained relations between the neighbors, which despite a 1953 armistice, have never officially declared an end to the Korean War.
The South responded in protest by partially suspending a landmark North-South military agreement, pledging to resume patrols along the demarcation line between the countries. The North then countered by abandoning the 2018 pact entirely and announcing it was redeploying its own forces to the area.

"South Korea's Yoon slams 'truly deplorable' North Korean remarks, calls for unification","South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol made a call for unification with North Korea in a speech on Friday celebrating the 105th anniversary of the independence movement against Japanese colonizers.

SEOUL, March 1 (UPI) -- South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for unification with North Korea in a speech Friday, while condemning the ""repressive rule"" of the Pyongyang regime. ""Unification is not just an issue confined to the Korean Peninsula,"" Yoon said in televised remarks celebrating the 105th anniversary of Korea's independence movement against Japanese colonizers. Advertisement
""The tyranny and human rights abuses of the North Korean regime deny the universal values of humanity,"" he said. ""Unification is precisely what is needed to expand the universal values of freedom and human rights.""
Yoon's comments come as inter-Koerean tensions are at their highest in years, amid a steady stream of weapons tests and bellicose rhetoric from the North and a stronger military stance from the South.
Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un proclaimed South Korea the ""principal enemy"" and publicly rejected a longstanding official policy goal of peaceful reunification.
Yoon called the declaration ""truly deplorable.""
""North Korea still continues its totalitarian system and repressive rule and is unable to escape from the worst forms of degradation and poverty,"" he said. ""The North Korean regime relies solely on nuclear weapons and missiles while trapping its 26 million citizens in a quagmire of misery and despair.""

Yoon also hailed Seoul's improving relationship with Tokyo, saying the two have become ""partners"" after a painful history that includes Japan's 1910-1945 colonial occupation of Korea.
Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has moved to repair frayed ties with Japan, which cratered after a 2019 ruling by South Korea's Supreme Court ordered Japanese companies to compensate Korean victims of wartime forced labor.
Seoul proposed a plan last March to compensate the victims through a public foundation without demanding contributions from Japan, leading to a series of summits between Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The thawing relationship has also led to stronger trilateral security ties with the United States against North Korean nuclear and missile threats, including a three-way summit in Camp David in August.
""Now, Korea and Japan are working together to overcome the painful past,"" Yoon said Friday.
""Sharing the values of freedom, human rights and the rule of law, our two countries have become partners in the pursuit of common interests for global peace and prosperity.""",2024-03-01T08:21:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
South Korea police raid medical association office over walkout,"SEOUL - South Korean police raided the offices of the Korean Medical Association on March 1, an officer told AFP, as the government contends with a doctors’ strike that has led to chaos in hospitals.
Nearly 10,000 junior doctors – about 80 per cent of the trainee workforce – walked off the job last week.
They are protesting against government plans to sharply increase medical school admissions to cope with shortages and an ageing society.
The government had set a Feb 29 deadline for medics to resume work or face potential legal consequences, including suspension of medical licences and arrest.
There is currently no official data on the number of doctors who have returned post-deadline, the Health Ministry told AFP, but South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said most striking doctors remained off the job on March 1.
The mass work stoppage has taken a toll on hospitals, prompting the government to raise its public health alert to the highest level.
Around half of the surgeries scheduled at 15 major hospitals have been cancelled since last week, according to the health ministry.
Under South Korean law, doctors are restricted from striking.
Earlier this week, the government requested the police investigate people connected to the stoppage.
Seoul’s police confirmed that it raided the Korean Medical Association (KMA) on March 1.
In response to the Feb 29 deadline and initiation of a police probe, the KMA slammed the government for “intimidation tactics” and accused it of turning the country into a “totalitarian state”.
The government says it is trying to address one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations. It is pushing to admit 2,000 more students to medical schools annually from 2025.
Doctors say the plan will hurt the quality of service and medical education, but proponents say medics are mainly concerned the changes could erode their salaries and social status.
The KMA said its members will hold a rally in Seoul on March 3, with local reports saying around 25,000 were expected to join. AFP",2024-03-01T06:38:00Z,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times
"South Korea's Yoon calls for unification, on holiday marking 1919 uprising against colonial Japan","South Koreans wave their national flags during a ceremony to celebrate the March First Independence Movement Day, the anniversary of the 1919 uprising against Japanese colonial rule, in front of the Independence Gate in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, March 1, 2024.

SEOUL – South Korea’s president lambasted North Korea on Friday over what he called its repressive rule and vowed to achieve a free, unified Korean Peninsula, weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rejected the idea of peaceful unification and threatened to occupy the South in the event of war.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol spoke on March 1 Independence Movement Day, a holiday marking a 1919 Korean uprising against Japanese colonial rule.

“Now, we must move toward a free, unified Korean Peninsula,” Yoon said in a televised speech. “The North Korean regime relies solely on nuclear weapons and missiles while trapping its 26 million citizens in a quagmire of misery and despair.”
“Unification is precisely what is needed to expand the universal values of freedom and human rights,” Yoon said. “Our unification efforts must become a source of hope and a beacon of light for the people of North Korea.”
Yoon and Kim's conflicting comments on unification come after Korean animosities have run high for more than two years, with North Korea ramping up missile tests and South Korea expanding military drills with the U.S. in a tit-for-tat cycle.
For most of the 70 years since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, unification was a prized goal of leaders in both Koreas, which are divided by the world’s most heavily fortified border. But the prospects for unifying the the rich, democratic South and the nominally socialist, authoritarian and poor North any time soon are extremely dim, observers say.
Despite extensive U.S.-led sanctions and its own economic mismanagement, North Korea has appeared politically stable. Exchange programs between the Koreas have been dormant since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with then-President Donald Trump collapsed in 2019.
In a speech in January, Kim vowed to rewrite the constitution to remove the long-running state goal of a peaceful Korean unification and cement South Korea as an “invariable principal enemy.” He said the new constitution must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war breaks out. The sudden abandonment of unification took observers by surprise.
Many experts say Kim likely aimed to take the initiative in dealings with the South while trying to diminish South Korean cultural influence and bolster his family’s rule at home.
During Friday's speech, Yoon called Kim's vow of enmity “truly deplorable.” He earlier said Kim's speech showed the “anti-national and anti-historical” nature of the North Korean government.
Yoon's speech didn't touch on the abuses of the Japanese colonial rulers in Korea, which left painful memories and have long been a source of tension between the two countries.
""On a holiday commemorating Korea’s resistance against Japanese colonialism a century ago, Yoon touted his administration’s improved relations with Tokyo,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul. “He emphasized that the independence movement will only be complete once the northern and southern halves of the Korean Peninsula are finally unified and free.”
Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has worked to beef up South Korea's military alliance with the U.S. and resolve historical disputes with Japan, aiming to forge a stronger Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership against North Korea's nuclear threats.
“Now, Korea and Japan are working together to overcome the painful past,” Yoon said. “Sharing the values of freedom, human rights and the rule of law, our two countries have become partners in the pursuit of common interests for global peace and prosperity.”",2024-03-01T06:19:41Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit
