On Friday, the UK and the Republic of Korea announced the AI Seoul Summit -- aka the AI Safety Summit and taking place on May 21 and May 22 -- where world leaders will meet to discuss the future of AI -- including AI safety, equitable access, and future innovations.
This event will build on the first AI Safety Summit, which took place in the UK last November, where worldwide leaders gathered to start discussions regarding generative AI and even reached a forward-looking agreement, known as the Bletchley Declaration, on the future of the technology's development.
On the first day of the Seoul Summit, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Republic of Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol will co-chair a virtual leaders' session. A select number of global industry leaders also will be invited to discuss how their models are adhering to the safety commitments made at Bletchley Park, according to the release.
The second day will feature an in-person session of DIgital Ministers co-hosted by UK Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan and Korean Minister of Science and ICT Lee Jong-Ho.
""AI is advancing at an unprecedented pace that exceeds our expectations, and it is crucial to establish global norms and governance to harness such technological innovations to enhance the welfare of humanity,"" said Jong-Ho.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,3,UK and South Korea to co-host AI Seoul Summit,"The UK and South Korea are set to co-host the AI Seoul Summit on the 21st and 22nd of May. This summit aims to pave the way for the safe development of AI technologies, drawing on the cooperative framework laid down by the Bletchley Declaration.
The two-day event will feature a virtual leaders’ session, co-chaired by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and a subsequent in-person meeting among Digital Ministers. UK Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan, and Korean Minister of Science and ICT Lee Jong-Ho will co-host the latter.
This summit builds upon the historic Bletchley Park discussions held at the historic location in the UK last year, emphasising AI safety, inclusion, and innovation. It aims to ensure that AI advancements benefit humanity while minimising potential risks and enhancing global governance on tech innovation.
“The summit we held at Bletchley Park was a generational moment,” stated Donelan. “If we continue to bring international governments and a broad range of voices together, I have every confidence that we can continue to develop a global approach which will allow us to realise the transformative potential of this generation-defining technology safely and responsibly.”
Echoing this sentiment, Minister Lee Jong-Ho highlighted the importance of the upcoming Seoul Summit in furthering global cooperation on AI safety and innovation.
“AI is advancing at an unprecedented pace that exceeds our expectations, and it is crucial to establish global norms and governance to harness such technological innovations to enhance the welfare of humanity,” explained Lee. “We hope that the AI Seoul Summit will serve as an opportunity to strengthen global cooperation on not only AI safety but also AI innovation and inclusion, and promote sustainable AI development.”
Innovation remains a focal point for the UK, evidenced by initiatives like the Manchester Prize and the formation of the AI Safety Institute: the first state-backed organisation dedicated to AI safety. This proactive approach mirrors the UK’s commitment to international collaboration on AI governance, underscored by a recent agreement with the US on AI safety measures.
Accompanying the Seoul Summit will be the release of the International Scientific Report on Advanced AI Safety. This report, independently led by Turing Prize winner Yoshua Bengio, represents a collective effort to consolidate the best scientific research on AI safety. It underscores the summit’s role not only as a forum for discussion but as a catalyst for actionable insight into AI’s safe development.
The agenda of the AI Seoul Summit reflects the urgency of addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. From discussing model safety evaluations, to fostering sustainable AI development. As the world embraces AI innovation, the AI Seoul Summit embodies a concerted effort to shape a future where technology serves humanity safely and delivers prosperity and inclusivity for all.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4,Kim Jong Un 'Desperate' to Control Narrative in North Korea: US Official,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's public moves to stop pursuing eventual unification with the South is rooted in a ""desperate"" effort to control the flow of information in country, according to a Biden administration diplomat.
The remark comes amid decades-high tensions on the Korean Peninsula, exacerbated by the North's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, its first successful spy satellite launch, and the South's military exercises with U.S. forces.
Earlier this year, the 40-year-old supreme leader said a rapprochement with the South was no longer practical, with the country's rubber-stamp parliament announcing it was amending the constitution to label Seoul as its ""primary foe.""
Kim also moved to abolish organizations that had been tasked with inter-Korean cooperation or pro-unification rhetoric. Other casualties of the campaign to scrub references to reunification, a goal of Kim's father and grandfather, include a 100-foot monument and commemorative stamps.

U.S. envoy on North Korean human rights Julie Turner said on April 10 that Kim's abandonment of North-South unification as a goal suggests desperation to control information within the reclusive country.

""Kim Jong-un's recent abandonment of reunification goals, the shift and rhetoric towards Seoul should be seen less as a strategic shift signaling his confidence in his ties with Russia and its weapons program and more as a desperate attempt to get control of the internal information environment,"" U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean human rights Julie Turner said Tuesday at a form hosted by the Korea Society non-profit organization.
Yet Turner added Washington is prepared to engage with North Korea on human rights in a ""transparent and outcome-oriented discussion"" that would include the U.S.'s own human rights record and efforts the country is taking to improve it.
A formal peace treaty between Seoul and Pyongyang has never been signed, despite the end of open hostilities in 1953.
The North Korean embassy in Beijing, China, did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
Also on Tuesday, Mira Rapp-Hooper, the National Security Council overseeing East Asia and Oceania affairs, said that the U.S. was open to dialogue with North Korea ""without precondition."" She specified this applied to a wide range of topics not limited to denuclearization.
Citizens in the impoverished country have extremely limited access to information, with state-controlled media propagating government narratives.
Internet access is heavily restricted, and possession of foreign media, such as that depicting the higher standard of life in the neighboring South, is punishable by hard labor and even death.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,5,"U.S., Japan and South Korea hold drills in South China Sea","ABOARD THE USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT — A U.S. carrier strike group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt has held a three-day joint exercise with its allies Japan and South Korea as President Joe Biden meets for talks with leaders from Japan and the Philippines at the White House.
The dueling military and diplomatic maneuvers are meant to strengthen the partners’ solidarity in the face of China’s aggressive military actions in the region.
A number of U.S. and South Korean guided missile destroyers and a Japanese warship joined the April 10-12 drill in the disputed East China Sea, where worries about China territorial claims are rising. The Associated Press was one of several news organizations allowed a front-row look at the drills.
Rear Adm. Christopher Alexander, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said the three nations conducted undersea warfare exercises, maritime interdiction operations, search and rescue drills and work focused on communication and data sharing. He told journalists Thursday on the Roosevelt that these drills would help improve communication among the United States and its allies and “better prepare us for a crisis in the region.”
F/A-18E Super Hornet combat jets took off from the carrier’s flight deck, which also had anti-submarine MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. Journalists were flown more than an hour from Kadena Air Base, the hub of U.S. Pacific air power. Kadena is on Japan’s southern island of Okinawa, which is home to about half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.
“It is a busy time; there is a lot going on in the world,” Alexander said. “The significance of this exercise is we have three like-minded countries, three like-minded navies that believe in peace, security and stability in the western Pacific.”
The participation of Japan and South Korea was another sign of improving ties between the sometimes wary neighbors. The two U.S. allies’ relationship has often been strained by the memory of Japan’s half-century colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has been pressing them to cooperate so the three partners can better deal with threats from China and North Korea.
This week’s huge parliamentary election defeat of the governing party of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought better relations with Japan, could constrain his Japan-friendly efforts, but experts believe ties will remain stable.
The latest naval exercise is part of Biden’s work to deepen security and diplomatic engagement with Indo-Pacific nations. Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the White House for their first trilateral talks Thursday, and has declared that the U.S. defense commitment to the Pacific allies is “ironclad.”
Tensions between China and the Philippines have risen over repeated clashes by the two nations’ coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan.
Beijing has defended its operations in the South China Sea and blamed the U.S. for creating tensions. Chinese President Xi Jinping had a series of talks this week with senior officials from Vietnam, Russia and Taiwan.
The U.S.-Japan-South Korea naval exercises follow four-way drills held in the South China Sea, where Japan joined the United States, Australia and the Philippines.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,6,Chinese official talks with North Korean counterpart in the nations’ highest-level meeting in years,"SEOUL, South Korea — A top Chinese official arrived in North Korea and held talks on how to strengthen their cooperation, North Korea’s state media reported Friday, in the countries’ highest-level meeting in about five years.
Zhao Leji, who is chairman of China’s National People’s Congress and considered the No. 3 official in the ruling Communist Party, arrived in North Korea on Thursday. China’s government earlier said he would stay in North Korea until Saturday.
Zhao met his North Korean counterpart, Choe Ryong Hae, later Thursday and discussed how to promote exchanges and cooperation in all areas including politics, economy and culture, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported.
The two also exchanged views on unspecified regional and international issues of mutual concern, KCNA said.
Zhao is one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s top leadership body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Zhao’s visit to North Korea marked the first bilateral exchange involving a Chinese Politburo Standing Committee member since the coronavirus pandemic started. In 2019, the two countries held two summit meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Observers say North Korea and China are expected to hold a number of exchanges this year to mark the 75th year since they established diplomatic ties.
North Korea has been seeking to strengthen its cooperation with China and Russia in the face of a standoff with the United States and South Korea over the North’s advancing nuclear program.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,8,S. Korea to cut number of teachers amid diminishing student numbers,"SEOUL – Amid administrative efforts to increase the annual enrolment quota for medical schools that sparked the mass walkout of doctors across South Korea, the government said it would reduce the number of school teachers going forward, citing a decline in student numbers.
The enrolment quota for teachers’ colleges, which has remained unchanged for 13 years, will be reduced by 12 per cent, the Education Ministry said.
Currently, 13 universities that train aspiring elementary school teachers take in 3,847 students every year. Besides Ewha Womans University, the only private school on the list, the remaining 12 schools will be impacted by the reduction plan, which will see the annual quota reduced to 3,390 seats in 2025.
The plan comes amid rising concerns over the employment of teachers, as the number of graduates from teaching colleges exceeds the number of teaching places available at elementary schools.
The number of newly hired teachers in 2024 declined by over 50 per cent compared to that in 2014, but the enrolment quota for related universities has remained stable over the same period. The acceptance rate for the appointment of new teachers fell to 43.6 per cent in 2024, down from 63.9 per cent in 2018.
This “appointment crisis” comes as more than 150 elementary schools across the nation had no new first-graders enrolling in 2024. Some 369,000 children enrolled in elementary school in 2024, the lowest number of new first-graders since the government started recording such statistics in 1970.
Meanwhile, the reduction plan falls short of the 20 per cent cut that the government had originally planned. However, considering the number of freshmen dropping out of school during the semester, the government accepted colleges’ requests to have the cutback remain at 12 per cent. In 2022, 8.5 per cent of teacher trainees left school during their first year of college.
Even with the reduction, there is still the possibility of an appointment crisis as the number of seats in training universities is expected to be higher than the number of spaces for new hires. According to the Ministry of Education’s teacher supply plan, the number of new elementary teachers will be between 2,600 and 2,900 per year from 2026 to 2027.
Though the number for 2028 and beyond has not been disclosed, given the rate of decline in the school-age population, it is unlikely to increase.
Even though the recent reduction reduces the number of students who wish to become teachers, the quota is still about 800 seats more than the availability of spaces for new hires.
“There will be room for adjustments (to the number of seats) as we continue to consider the operating status of universities, the scale of new recruitment of elementary teachers, and the rate of elementary school student enrolment,” a ministry official explained.

Zhao Leji, the third highest-ranking official in Beijing and a member of the powerful Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo, is currently on a goodwill visit to North Korea as the two nations commemorate 75 years of diplomatic relations.

The move came after concern rose in Beijing and Washington over Kim Jong Un’s blossoming alliance with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
As North Korea’s most crucial economic benefactor and diplomatically, China has consistently opposed US-led efforts, alongside Russia, to impose stricter sanctions on Kim Jong Un’s regime at the UN Security Council in response to its heightened weapons testing activities.
During his visit to Pyongyang, Zhao met with his North Korean counterpart, Choe Ryong Hae, to discuss “exchange and cooperation in all fields, including politics, economy, and culture,” as reported by KCNA.
The two also exchanged views on unspecified regional and international issues of mutual concerns, KCNA said.
Zhao is one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s top leadership body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Zhao’s visit to North Korea marked the first bilateral exchange involving a Chinese Politburo Standing Committee member since the coronavirus pandemic started. In 2019, the two countries held two summit meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Observers say North Korea and China are expected to hold a number of exchanges this year to mark the 75th year since they established diplomatic ties.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,12,Chinese official talks with North Korean counterpart in the nations’ highest-level meeting in years,"A top Chinese official arrived in North Korea and held talks on how to boost their co-operation, North Korea’s state media reported Friday, in the counties’ highest-level meeting in about five years.
Zhao Leji, who is chairman of China’s National People’s Congress and considered the No. 3 official in the ruling Communist Party, arrived in North Korea on Thursday. China’s government earlier said he will stay in North Korea until Saturday.
Zhao met his North Korean counterpart Choe Ryong Hae later Thursday and discussed how to promote exchanges and co-operation on all areas such as politics, economy and culture, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported.
The two also exchanged views on unspecified regional and international issues of mutual concerns, KCNA said.
Zhao is one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s top leadership body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Zhao’s visit to North Korea marked the first bilateral exchange involving a Chinese Politburo Standing Committee member since the coronavirus pandemic started. In 2019, the two countries held two summit meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Observers say North Korea and China are expected to hold a number of exchanges this year to mark the 75th year since they established diplomatic ties.
North Korea has been seeking to boost its co-operation with China and Russia in the face of a standoff with the United States and South Korea over the North’s advancing nuclear program.
China, North Korea’s biggest aid benefactor, is believed to have long provided clandestine assistance to North Korea in violation of international sanctions.

Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Friday after an inflation-fueled selloff in the previous session, with investor assessing economic data from Singapore and South Korea while awaiting China trade numbers.
China's trade data for March will be released later in the day, with exports forecast to fall 2.3% year on year by economists polled by Reuters. This follows a weaker-than-expected rise in the country's inflation on Thursday.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,16,"BOK Keeps Rate on Hold, Opting for Steady Stance After Polls","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea kept its benchmark interest rate on hold in a decision underscoring its aim to rein in inflationary pressure in a steady manner after an election setback for the ruling party.
South Korea’s central bank Friday kept its seven-day repurchase rate at 3.5%, a level it characterizes as restrictive, marking the 10th consecutive decision to hold since it last hiked in early 2023. All 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast policy would stay unchanged.
The decision shows the board remains worried about inflation, which outstripped expectations in March and stayed above the bank’s 2% target. Rising costs of living were high on the minds of voters when they cast their ballots in Wednesday’s parliamentary election, which resulted in a major defeat for President Yoon Suk Yeol’s ruling party.
Household debt is another concern keeping policymakers cautious about suggesting a policy pivot may be on its way. On the plus side, continuing growth in exports indicates external demand remains strong enough keep the trade-reliant economy humming this year without the need for monetary stimulus.
“There’s a risk of household debt increases picking up around mortgages with real estate sales rising after the election,"" KB Securities analyst Lim Jae-kyun said in a report before the decision, citing a history of such patterns.
BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong will disclose whether there were any dissenters to the latest decision at a press conference starting shortly after 11 a.m. in Seoul. Markets will also be interested in the latest assessments pertaining to a peak for rates.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,17,"Japan PM urges Ukraine support, calls China ‘greatest strategic challenge’ in address to Congress","Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida declared China the “greatest strategic challenge” to world peace Thursday and urged Congress to continue its support for Ukraine amid its war with Russia in an address to a joint meeting of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
Kishida, 66, celebrated Japan’s “firm alliance and enduring friendship” with America in his roughly half-hour speech, calling on Washington to “deter aggression and ensure peace” against mounting military and nuclear threats from China, Russia and North Korea.
“The post-Cold War era is already behind us, and we are now at an inflection point that will define the next stage of human history,” he told House and Senate lawmakers as well as members of President Biden’s Cabinet.
“Turning to Japan’s own neighborhood, China’s current external stance and military actions present an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge, not only to the peace and security of Japan but to the peace and stability of the international community at large,” he said.

The Japanese head of government also warned of the danger posed by North Korea’s growing nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities, with dictator Kim Jong Un having recently approved ballistic missile shipments to Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, in waging an “unprovoked, unjust, and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine” has also sparked “worldwide concern that yet another catastrophe by nuclear weapon use is a real possibility,” Kishida noted.
In a stark warning about the stakes of the European war, the prime minister told US lawmakers, “Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow.”

“Peace requires more than understanding. It requires resolve,” he affirmed, emphasizing the strength that alliances with the US and other nations have brought through his speech. “Japan will continue to stand with Ukraine.”
For nearly two months, the House has stalled on passing a $95 billion Senate-approved national security package with funding for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific region to counter the rising threats.
That delay has been heightened by a further threat to House Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has warned the Louisiana Republican that a vote on Ukraine aid could trigger his ouster.

Japan announced in February that it would provide $12 billion for Ukraine’s defense, and the prime minister further promised to continue coordinating with NATO nations and increase his own nation’s defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027.
A native of Hiroshima, Kishida pointed to the great strides his country and the US have made since the “the devastation of World War II,” but pointed out the “undercurrent of self-doubt” afflicting the US about what its “role in the world should be.”
“The US shaped the international order in the postwar world through economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power. It championed freedom and democracy. It encouraged the stability and prosperity of nations, including Japan,” he reminded the members.

“The United States policy was based on the premise that humanity does not want to live oppressed by an authoritarian state, where you are tracked and surveilled and denied from expressing what is in your heart and on your mind,” he went on, without explicitly referencing China’s spying on Americans through the Beijing-based parent company of the social media app TikTok.
In a reverse of the national security bill, the House last month overwhelmingly passed a measure to force the sale of TikTok within six months by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has not put it up for a floor vote.
“Social media is censored, monitored and controlled,” Kishida said, referring to it as one of many “new forms of oppression” along with “rapid advances” in artificial intelligence technology.

“I do not want to leave our children a society where human rights are suppressed, where political self-determination is denied, where our lives are monitored by digital technology,” he said. “I know you don’t either.”
Kishida also touted his nation’s investments in the US economy and joint partnerships on military and technological projects, including $800 billion from Japan to help create American jobs and coordination with the US to put a Japanese astronaut on the moon in the near future.
Kishida’s address was only the second speech to Congress by a Japanese prime minister after the late Shinzo Abe delivered an address to a joint meeting in 2015.

Abe was assassinated in 2022 over his political links to the Unification Church, also known as the Moonies, in a shocking mid-day shooting that later forced Kishida to drop one of his Cabinet officials over similar ties.
While stirring lawmakers to meet the moment of international crisis, Kishida also spoke fondly of his childhood experiences in a Queens public elementary school and his family trips to Niagara Falls as a boy.
“Thank you for making my family and me feel so welcome,” Kishida said, before joking of his own country’s legislature: “I never get such nice applause from the Japanese Diet.”",2024-04-11 17:40:08,https://nypost.com,New York Post,17,prime minister declared china strategic challenge world peace congress continue support amid war russia address joint meeting 66 celebrated firm alliance enduring friendship roughly speech calling deter aggression ensure peace mounting military nuclear china russia north war era already behind u inflection point define next stage human history told house senate well president neighborhood current external stance military present unprecedented strategic challenge peace security japan peace stability international community large said6 prime minister declared china strategic challenge world peace congress continue support amid war russia joint address congress via head government also danger north growing nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile dictator kim un recently ballistic missile president unprovoked unjust brutal war aggression also sparked concern yet another catastrophe nuclear weapon use real possibility stark warning war prime minister told u today may east tomorrow6 stark warning war prime minister told u today may east tomorrow via understanding resolve strength u brought speech japan continue stand nearly two house passing 95 billion national security package region counter rising delay threat house speaker mike leadership rep republican vote aid could trigger ouster6 nearly two house passing 95 billion senate national security package backed white house region counter rising via would provide 12 billion defense prime minister continue increase defense budget 2 2027a native pointed great country u made since devastation world war pointed undercurrent afflicting u role world u shaped international order postwar world economic diplomatic military technological power freedom democracy stability prosperity japan members6 delay threat house speaker mike leadership rep republican leader vote aid could trigger ouster united policy based premise humanity want live oppressed authoritarian state tracked heart mind went without explicitly parent company social medium reverse national security bill house last month overwhelmingly measure force sale within six parent company senate majority leader chuck put floor medium said one many new oppression along rapid artificial intelligence technology6 never explicitly parent company social medium spoke social medium via want leave society human suppressed political digital technology said know dont also u economy joint military technological 800 billion japan help create u put astronaut moon near address second speech congress prime minister late address joint meeting 20156 war era already behind u inflection point define next stage human history said mounting peace 2022 political link unification church also known shocking midday shooting later forced drop one cabinet similar stirring meet moment international crisis also spoke fondly childhood public elementary school family making family feel welcome said legislature never get nice applause diet japan support china strategic challenge address congress
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,18,NewJeans Asks U.S. Court to Reveal YouTuber In Korean Defamation Case,"NewJeans is asking an American court to force Google to unmask an anonymous YouTube user so that the person can be criminally prosecuted under South Korea’s strict libel laws for posting “false and defamatory videos” about the K-pop band.
In court documents filed last month, attorneys for NewJeans requested that a California federal judge issue a subpoena requiring Google to reveal the user’s identity. The band wants the info because they are seeking criminal charges in South Korea – a far more serious penalty for defamation than exists under U.S. law.

“The applicants are members of a female K-Pop group, who have come under attack by an anonymous individual posting false and defamatory videos on YouTube,” the group’s lawyer wrote in the March 27 petition, which was obtained by Billboard. “Unfortunately, without the YouTuber’s personally identifiable information the criminal case cannot be fully prosecuted.”
Trending on Billboard
The band’s target is the anonymous owner of a YouTube account called “7th Grade in Middle School,” which attorneys for NewJeans say has “engaged in name-calling or other mocking behavior” and has posted as many as 33 defamatory videos that have been viewed more than 13 million times. They cited one particularly “derogatory” post, which allegedly claimed that NewJeans member Min-ji Kim was the “eldest daughter of a Vietnamese farmer.”
HYBE, the parent company of NewJeans’ label ADOR, did not immediately return a request for comment on the legal proceedings. The recent court filings, which were refiled in court last week, were first reported by The New York Times.
The case illustrates striking differences between U.S. and South Korean protections for free speech. Under American law, defamation is a civil wrong that can lead to damages, but one that’s sharply limited by the First Amendment. To win such a case, public figures like the members of NewJeans would need to prove that the YouTube user knowingly made false statements, a burden that’s intentionally difficult to satisfy.
In South Korea, on the other hand, defamation is a criminal offense that can be “punished by imprisonment with labor for up to seven years,” and even fully true statements can face criminal penalties. In 2015, a United Nations watchdog called out South Korea‘s “increasing use of criminal defamation laws to prosecute persons who criticize government action.” In 2022, a U.S. State Department report warned that public figures in Korea had used the country’s libel laws to “restrict public discussion and harass, intimidate, or censor private and media expression.”
NewJeans isn’t the first K-pop group to use those laws. In 2019, HYBE (then Big Hit Entertainment) filed criminal defamation cases over BTS, alleging the targets had behind “personal attacks” on the band. In 2022, Big Hit did so again over “malicious postings” about BTS, asking the group’s famous fan “army” to help gather evidence. YG Entertainment, the label behind Blackpink, has also filed its own complaint against “internet trolls,” accusing them of “spreading groundless rumours about our singers.”
According to the recent U.S. court filings, NewJeans’ label ADOR filed a criminal complaint with police in Seoul in March, but the case has stalled because they cannot identify the actual person behind the YouTube account. The group’s attorneys say they sent a request for such information to Google, but that the American tech giant has refused to hand it over.
A spokesman for Google declined to comment when reached by Billboard on Thursday. In a policy statement regarding government requests for personal information, the company says: “Google carefully reviews each request to make sure it satisfies applicable laws. If a request asks for too much information, we try to narrow it, and in some cases we object to producing any information at all.”",2024-04-11 16:05:51,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard,18,court force unmask anonymous user person criminally south strict libel posting false defamatory court last month federal judge issue subpoena reveal identity band seeking criminal south korea far serious penalty defamation u aim music female group come attack anonymous individual posting false defamatory lawyer wrote march 27 petition billboard unfortunately without personally identifiable information criminal case fully target anonymous owner account 7th grade middle school say engaged behavior posted many 33 defamatory 13 million time one particularly derogatory post allegedly member kim eldest daughter parent company label immediately return request comment legal recent court filing court last week first new york case striking u south free speech law defamation civil wrong lead damage one thats sharply limited first amendment win case public like would need prove user knowingly made false burden thats intentionally difficult south korea hand defamation criminal offense imprisonment labor seven even fully true face criminal 2015 united watchdog south increasing use criminal defamation prosecute criticize government action 2022 u state department report public korea used libel restrict public discussion harass intimidate censor private medium first group use 2019 big hit entertainment criminal defamation behind personal band 2022 big hit malicious famous fan army help gather evidence entertainment label behind also complaint spreading groundless recent u court filing label criminal complaint police march case identify actual person behind account say sent request information tech giant hand spokesman declined comment billboard policy statement regarding government personal information company carefully request make sure applicable request much information try narrow object information u court reveal defamation case
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,19,US Navy secretary says he was 'floored' by a Pacific ally's shipbuilding abilities amid American warship production woes,"US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said he was ""floored"" at South Korea's shipbuilding abilities.
A recent review found that the US Navy's top shipbuilding programs are heavily delayed by years.

Amid concerns about American shipbuilding, the US Navy's top civilian official said this week that he was ""floored"" by a Pacific ally's capabilities in this space.
The Navy secretary's comments came on the heels of an internal review that discovered that most of the Navy's top programs, including high-priority submarines, a first-in-class guided-missile frigate, and the third Ford-class aircraft carrier, are severely delayed by years, fueling worries from US officials about the ability to maintain our pace against great power rivals.
During his keynote speech at the Navy League's Sea Air Space conference this week, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said his recent trip to South Korea had left him impressed by their shipbuilding.
""When my team and I went to South Korea, we were floored at the level of digitization and real-time monitoring of shipbuilding progress, with readily available information down to individual pieces of stock materials,"" Del Toro said.
""Their top executives could tell us to the day when ships would be delivered,"" he said. That's a stark difference from the US, which is facing problems with its shipbuilding capacity, labor availability, and resources.

Back in January, Del Toro ordered a 45-day review to assess the progress of the Navy's top shipbuilding programs, which found that most were delayed. After the review's findings were made public, Del Toro ordered a follow-up review into solutions for the delays.

Del Toro paid a visit to South Korea's yards in February, during which he encouraged companies to invest in commercial and naval shipbuilding facilities in the US. He noted ""there are numerous former shipyard sites around the country which are largely intact and dormant"" that are ""ripe for redevelopment.""
He also called South Korean shipbuilding ""an asset"" to the US, especially ""as China continues to aggressively pursue worldwide shipbuilding dominance,"" the Navy said at the time.
That month, retired US Marine Corps Maj. Jeffrey L. Seavy wrote for the US Naval Institute that China had roughly 47% of the global market on shipbuilding, the most of any country, with South Korea coming in second at around 29% and Japan in third with about 17%. The US ""has a relative insignificant capacity at 0.13%,"" he said, referencing numbers from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
During his recent Sea Air Space speech, Del Toro further praised South Korea and commended Japan, saying both Pacific allies could build high-quality ships on time, on budget, and often at a fraction of the cost.

""It's an ethos, a commitment to constant improvement that is the foundation of their reputation for consistently delivering on time and on budget, even during COVID,"" he said.
Though some delays have stemmed from the challenge of building first-in-class vessels, the Navy has attributed much of the delays currently bogging down its important shipbuilding programs to the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that residual supply chain and labor issues have pushed timelines back and ballooned costs.
The Navy is trying to find solutions though. According to Hon. Nick Guertin, the Navy acquisition executive, the Navy review ""identified major initiatives to drive improvement that we plan to pursue.""
""Our Navy ships exist to strengthen American dominance and deliver warfighting capability by providing the tools our warfighters need to operate the world's strongest navy. In order to provide these key warfighting tools, shipbuilding challenges must be addressed,"" he told reporters earlier this month.",2024-04-11 16:00:00,https://www.businessinsider.in,Business Insider India,19,u navy secretary toro said south shipbuilding recent review found u top shipbuilding heavily shipbuilding u top civilian official said week pacific navy came internal review discovered top frigate third aircraft carrier severely u ability maintain pace great power keynote speech navy sea air space conference week secretary navy toro said recent trip south korea left team went south korea level shipbuilding progress readily available information individual stock toro top could tell u day would said thats stark difference u facing shipbuilding capacity labor availability toro ordered 45day review ass progress top shipbuilding found made public toro ordered review toro visit south invest commercial naval shipbuilding u noted numerous former shipyard around country largely intact dormant ripe also south shipbuilding asset u especially china aggressively pursue shipbuilding dominance navy said month retired u marine corp l seavy wrote u naval institute china roughly 47 global market shipbuilding country south korea coming second around 29 japan third 17 u relative insignificant capacity 013 said united conference trade recent sea air space speech toro south korea japan saying pacific ally could build time budget often fraction ethos commitment constant improvement foundation reputation consistently time budget even covid stemmed challenge building navy much currently important shipbuilding covid19 pandemic residual supply chain labor back navy trying find though according nick navy acquisition executive navy review major drive improvement plan navy exist strengthen dominance deliver capability providing need operate navy order provide key shipbuilding must told month u navy secretary pacific shipbuilding amid warship production
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,20,Satellite Images Show Russia-North Korea Arms Trade,"New satellite imagery may give a snapshot of the deepening partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang.
A pair of cargo ships believed to have facilitated illicit munitions and oil transfers between Russia and North Korea were on Sunday captured docked next to stacks of containers in the other country's port.
Russia has been supplying oil directly to North Korea, in violation of U.N. Security Council sanctions that cap shipments at 500,000 barrels per annum. North Korea, meanwhile, is suspected of shipping thousands of containers of munitions by sea, rail, and air to help replenish Russia's stockpiles as it runs through resources more than two years into its war with Ukraine.
According to the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies' (CSIS) Korea Chair program, one of the satellite photos shows what is likely North Korea-flagged cargo ship Paek Yang San 1, which the U.N. has flagged over its involvement in illicit oil transfers to the Kim Jong Un regime.

The vessel can be seen docked at Russia's far eastern Vostochny Port. Its arrival followed at least five such visits at the port by North Korean tankers, according to satellite imagery shared with the Financial Times by the British think tank the Royal United Services Institute.
The CSIS analysts were confident the other photo showed the Russian cargo ship Maria parked at Najin, a North Korean port city less than 20 miles from the Russian border.
The North Korean embassy in Beijing, China, and Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to written requests for comment.
The Maria is one of four Russian cargo ships sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for alleged ""proliferation of military equipment and munitions from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) to Russia.""
Along with the Maria, the Lady R, the Angara, the Maia-1 made 32 port calls at the North Korean city Rason since the supply runs were first tracked last August.
Last month, analyst group NK Pro pointed to satellite imagery showing what appeared to be the Lady R at North Korea's Rason Port, marking a return of Russian cargo ships after a month's absence.
Though Russia has expanded its own munitions production to maintain its ground operations in Ukraine, fluctuating shortages continue.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik told reporters in late February that North Korea had sent an estimated 6,700 shipping containers of ammunition to Russia. These potentially contained as many as 3 million 152-millimeter artillery shells, he said—a type of ammunition in particularly short supply.

TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,21,South Korea’s ‘Luke Skywalker’ strikes blow against president Yoon,"Cho Kuk (centre), leader of the South Korean Rebuilding Korea Party holds a placard outside the supreme prosecutor's office in Seoul that translates as 'Prosecutors should bear in mind their public duty as guardians of the public interest'. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/Getty Images
A convicted former minister vowing revenge against conservative president Yoon Suk Yeol has helped deliver a resounding defeat to the South Korean leader in parliamentary elections.
Former minister for justice Cho Kuk, convicted on corruption charges after he was investigated by Mr Yoon during his time as prosecutor-general, campaigned on an end to Mr Yoon’s “prosecutorial dictatorship”.
Mr Cho’s newly formed Rebuilding Korea Party is projected to win between 14 and 16 seats, according to results released early on Thursday, helping the country’s left-wing alliance across a 180-seat threshold that will allow it to fast-track legislation.
The main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) is projected to win 176 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly, against 109 seats for Mr Yoon’s ruling People Power Party (PPP), as voters voiced their anger at the rising cost of living. While the country’s cabinet is appointed by the president, legislative initiatives require parliamentary support.

“The people have clearly shown their hopes for a verdict on the Yoon administration,” said Mr Cho after the release on Wednesday night of exit polls indicating a left-wing victory. “Yoon should humbly accept the outcome and apologise to the public for his wrongdoings and corruption.”
Mr Cho received a two-year prison sentence last year, which he is yet to serve as he is appealing against the ruling, on corruption charges relating to the forging of documents to help his daughter gain a place at a top medical school. If a higher court confirms the conviction, he faces disqualification from the National Assembly.

The prosecution, which was overseen by Mr Yoon in his capacity as prosecutor-general during the previous left-wing government, led to Mr Cho losing his professorship, his daughter losing her medical licence and his wife being sent to prison. It also made Mr Yoon a hero among Korean conservatives, who anointed him as their candidate for the 2022 presidential election which he went on to win.
Now, however, Mr Cho is back and calling for Mr Yoon and PPP leader Han Dong-hoon — himself a former prosecutor who was involved in Mr Cho’s indictment — to face prosecution for what he alleges are their abuses of prosecutorial power.
Lee Sangsin, a research fellow and polling expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification (Kinu), noted Mr Cho’s “compelling backstory” as a famous student protester jailed in the 1980s under the country’s former authoritarian regime. Mr Cho went on to be a star professor at the country’s most prestigious university.
“Cho was like the original K-pop idol, with looks, intelligence and morality on his side,” said Mr Lee. “Now he is presenting himself as the country’s Luke Skywalker, with Yoon cast in the role of Darth Vader — it’s a narrative that many liberal Koreans find hard to resist.”
Mr Lee said that while the Rebuilding Korea Party will remain a minor player in the South Korean National Assembly, Mr Cho’s criticism of Mr Yoon had struck a chord with voters unhappy with the president’s strongman governing style.
Since his election two years ago by a margin of less than 1 per cent over DPK leader Lee Jae-myung, Mr Yoon has picked a succession of battles with adversaries ranging from labour unions, striking doctors, domestic media outlets and past and present political opponents.

But his image as a graft-buster was badly undermined by a scandal surrounding his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, over her acceptance of a Christian Dior bag worth about Won3million (about €2,000) from a Korean-American pastor.
Mr Yoon has refused to apologise or explain the episode, which was caught on hidden camera and widely circulated on social media. Ms Kim has not made a public appearance since mid-December. They have both denied any wrongdoing.
“Yoon doesn’t care about people’s livelihoods,” said HA Han, a 53-year-old housewife from the city of Anyang, who voted for the DPK. “Inflation has gone up so much but he is out of touch with what’s going on. He is so dogmatic and doesn’t listen to what others say.”
“Koreans expect their presidents to compromise, but Yoon has consistently chosen confrontation instead,” said Kinu’s Mr Lee. “He has alienated moderate voters and they have punished him at the ballot box.”
Meanwhile, Mr Cho is already being spoken of as a potential left-wing candidate in the 2027 presidential election. But to do so he will have to defeat DPK leader Lee, who recovered from a knife attack in January to lead his party to a resounding victory.
Mr Lee also noted a sharp generational disparity in attitudes towards Mr Cho, with older left-wing Koreans recalling his past as a student protester and younger Koreans — who experienced fierce competition for a small number of places at elite universities — resenting his intervention to support his daughter’s medical school application.
The left-wing alliance fell short of a 200-seat threshold that would have allowed them to circumvent a presidential veto. But with South Korean presidents limited by the country’s constitution to one five-year term, Mr Yoon “now faces more than three years as a lame duck, while the country faces more than three years of stalemate”. — Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024",2024-04-11 14:36:00,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times,21,cho leader south korea party placard outside supreme office bear mind public duty public interest photograph former minister revenge conservative president deliver resounding defeat south leader parliamentary minister justice cho corruption time end newly formed korea party win 14 16 according early helping alliance across 180seat threshold allow main opposition democratic party korea win 176 300seat national assembly 109 ruling people power party voiced anger rising cost living cabinet president legislative require parliamentary people clearly shown verdict administration said cho release night exit victory humbly accept outcome public cho received prison sentence last year yet serve appealing ruling corruption forging help daughter gain place top medical school higher court conviction disqualification national president yeo well photograph prosecution overseen capacity previous government led cho losing professorship daughter losing medical wife sent prison also made hero among candidate 2022 presidential election went winnow however cho back calling leader han former prosecutor involved indictment face prosecution research fellow polling expert korea institute national unification noted compelling famous student protester 1980s former authoritarian regime cho went star professor prestigious like original idol intelligence morality side said lee luke cast role narrative many liberal find hard lee said korea party remain minor player south national assembly criticism struck chord unhappy governing election two ago margin le 1 per cent leader lee picked succession ranging labour striking domestic medium past present political leader democratic party wife kim district office south korea photograph image badly scandal surrounding wife first lady kim acceptance bag worth won3million € 2000 explain episode caught hidden camera widely social medium kim made public appearance since doesnt care said ha han 53yearold housewife city inflation gone much touch whats going dogmatic doesnt listen expect compromise consistently chosen confrontation instead said lee moderate ballot cho already spoken potential candidate 2027 presidential election defeat leader lee knife attack lead party resounding lee also noted sharp generational disparity towards cho older past student protester younger experienced fierce competition small number elite intervention support medical school alliance fell short 200seat threshold would circumvent presidential veto south limited constitution one term three lame duck country three stalemate copyright financial time limited 2024 south luke blow president

NASA captured a mystical surfboard hovering above the lunar surface with its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The surfboard figure is actually the Korea Aerospace Research Institute’s Danuri lunar orbiter, which orbits the Moon parallel to LRO.When someone thinks about images of the Moon being sent back to Earth, they don’t typically expect to see something that resembles a surfboard. But this was this case in images from NASA’s LRO spacecraft taken between March 5 and 6, 2024. Of course, this was not a surfboard, but instead a smeared image of Korea’s Danuri lunar orbiter Danuri was captured in a totally tubular manner using LRO’s narrow angle camera during three orbits, while LRO was close enough to the Korean orbiter to snag the shots. Those incredible shots took immaculate timing on the part of the LRO operations team in pointing LRO’s camera array to the right place at the right time. The lunar orbiter appears smeared due to the two spacecraft traveling at speeds of about 7,500mph, or 11,500kph, even though the camera’s exposure time was only 0.338 milliseconds.While Danuri has only been orbiting the Moon since December 2022, LRO launched on its lunar mission on June 18, 2009. The seasoned spacecraft was the first US mission to the Moon in over a decade, and has created an 3D map of the Moon as part of a program to identify future landing sites and resources.This also is not the first time LRO has sneaked a peek at another spacecraft while orbiting the Moon. The most recent image of another spacecraft was taken on February 24, 2024, when the lunar orbiter grabbed an image of Intuitive Machine’s Nova-C lander, called Odysseus. Images from LRO will be vital in upcoming Artemis missions, which will place human boots back on the lunar surface for the first time in over 50 years.

FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,23,Potential new headline: What led to the loss of Yoon's party in South Korea's elections and the challenges ahead for the leader,"South Korean voters have handed liberals extended opposition control of parliament in what looks like a massive political setback to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Some experts say the results of Wednesday's parliamentary elections make Yoon ""a lame duck"" — or even ""a dead duck"" — for his remaining three years in office. Others disagree, saying Yoon still has many policy levers and could aggressively push his foreign policy agenda.
But it's certain that the election outcome poses the toughest political challenge to Yoon since the former top prosecutor took office in 2022 for a single five-year term.
Here is a look at what the election results mean to Yoon and South Korean politics.
HOW DAMAGED IS YOON POLITICALLY? Even before Yoon's inauguration, South Korea's single-chamber National Assembly was controlled by the liberal Democratic Party. Squabbling with Yoon over a range of issues, Democratic Party lawmakers have frequently limited his domestic agenda. Yoon badly needed his party to regain a parliamentary majority so they could support his agenda. But his People Power Party and its satellite party only won 108 seats in the 300-member parliament, while the Democratic Party and two other liberal parties took a combined 187 seats. The incoming parliament has a four-year term, meaning its liberal control will likely continue until after Yoon leaves office in 2027. Yoon's hold on the ruling party could be subsequently weakened because many members' loyalty to the president was largely based on their hopes to get party tickets to run for elections. ""He'd be more like a dead duck, rather than a lame duck,"" said Park Sung-min, president of Seoul-based MIN Consulting, a political consulting firm. ""In the past two years, he was able to control the ruling party as there were elections coming. But the elections are over now, and he's in a considerably difficult situation."" Hong Sung Gul, a public administration professor at Seoul's Kookmin University, said Yoon will likely face increasing Democratic Party-led opposition against his push for business-friendly policies, tax reforms and other major policies that require legislative endorsement. Yoon's prime minister and senior presidential advisers offered to resign en masse on Thursday in an apparent effort to restore public confidence in the government. Hong said Yoon may need to reshuffle Cabinet members as well.
WHY DID YOON'S PARTY LOSE THE ELECTIONS? The elections were widely viewed as a mid-term litmus test of Yoon's government. So he's being chiefly blamed for the election debacle. Since becoming president, Yoon has struggled with low approval ratings — hovering between 30 per cent and 40 per cent. Critics accuse him of mismanaging economic issues like rising prices; failing to seek cooperation with opposition leaders over policy priorities; and filling key posts with former prosecutors and associates, while refusing to replace some of those who were involved in scandals. Also hurting his popularity were scandals involving his wife and first lady Kim Keon Hee. Spy camera footage was released that purportedly showed her accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor. Earlier this year, Yoon's approval ratings briefly rose thanks to public support over his high-stakes push to drastically increase the number of medical students, a step that his predecessors failed to achieve. But thousands of incumbent doctors have gone on strike in protest of Yoon's plan, leaving him with growing calls to seek a compromise.
""Yoon has carried out some reform steps. But his style is tough and he is pushing things forward so hard. But what matters is our people won't tolerate leaders being seen as arrogant,"" Hong said.
IS YOON'S FOREIGN POLICY INTACT? Despite the election defeat, Yoon's major foreign policies remain unchanged, as they usually don't need parliamentary approval.
""Yoon will likely accelerate his foreign policies, like on North Korea, strengthening the alliance with the U.S., improving relations with Japan and contributing more to global issues because of his own conviction and style,"" said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security. ""He may even pursue bolder foreign policies."" Kim said a potential challenge in implementing such policies is ""whether the bureaucrats will implement them with the same fervor as they have been,'' especially if parliament cuts budgets or if bureaucrats feel that the domestic political environment is unstable until 2027, when South Korea holds an election to choose Yoon's successor.
Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said that Yoon is not a lame duck ""because his administration still has many policy levers and is likely to maintain its approach to international relations."" ""Pyongyang has little reason to comment directly on election outcomes but could intensify efforts at sowing divisions in South Korean society,"" Easley said.
WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS FOR OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS? The election results boosted the political standing of Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party chairman who lost the hotly contested 2022 presidential election to Yoon. Lee is one of the early favourites to run in 2027, along with Han Dong-hoon, a Yoon ally who directed the ruling party's campaign. Also in the media spotlight is Cho Kuk, a disgraced liberal former justice minister whose newly launched small party won 12 seats. Observers say Cho is a potential liberal challenger to Lee. But both Lee and Cho face legal issues. Lee is under a slew of corruption investigations that he says were politically orchestrated by the Yoon government. Cho could also go to jail if the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings that sentenced him to two years in prison on various charges, including abuse of power and faking credentials to help his children get into prestigious schools.
The election results dealt a blow to Han. But much of the criticism is against Yoon, while Han, a former justice minister and political novice, built a strong political fanbase during the election campaign. If both Lee and Cho survive their legal troubles and vie for presidency, they could split the liberal vote, helping conservatives.
""Han isn't still free from the defeat,"" said Cho Jinman, a professor at Seoul's Duksung Women's University. ""The conservatives have to seek changes so they may look for a new face to run for the next presidency too.''

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,24,South Korean prime minister offers to resign after parliamentary election defeat,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s prime minister and senior presidential officials offered to resign en masse Thursday after their ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections in a huge blow to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol.
The results of Wednesday’s elections mean the liberal opposition forces will prolong their control of parliament until after Yoon completes his single five-year term in 2027. That will most likely set back Yoon’s domestic agenda and weaken his grip on the ruling party as he faces the opposition’s intensifying political offensive during his remaining three years in office, experts say.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and all senior presidential advisers to Yoon, except those in charge of security issues, submitted their resignations, according to Yoon’s office. It did not immediately say whether Yoon accepted their resignations.
Executive power in South Korea is heavily concentrated in the president, but the prime minister is the No. 2 official and leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated.
Yoon said he will “humbly uphold” the public sentiments reflected in the election outcome and focus on improving people’s economic situations and on reforming state affairs, Yoon’s presidential chief of staff, Lee Kwan-seop, said in a televised briefing.
In a separate news conference, ruling People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon said he would step down as well to take responsibility for the election defeat.
“I apologize to the people on behalf of our party, which wasn’t good enough to win the people’s choices,” he said.
With most of the votes counted, the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party appeared to have won a combined 175 seats in the 300-member National Assembly. Another small liberal opposition party was expected to win 12 seats under a proportional representation system, according to South Korean media tallies.
Yoon’s ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to have obtained 108 seats.
The final official results were expected later Thursday.
Regardless of the results, Yoon will stay in power and his major foreign policies will most likely be unchanged. But Wednesday’s elections were widely seen as a midterm confidence vote on Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022.
Yoon has pushed hard to boost cooperation with the United States and Japan as a way to address a mix of tough security and economic challenges. But he has been grappling with low approval ratings at home and a liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly that has limited his major policy platforms that require legislative approvals.
Hong Sung Gul, a public administration expert at Seoul’s Kookmin University, said Yoon will most likely find it more difficult to implement business-friendly policies and tax reforms, as the opposition parties are likely to aggressively flex their legislative muscles.
“When it comes to policies, important ones like tax system reforms require legislation. I think there is a high possibility for the opposition parties to put a brake on Yoon’s such policy agendas,” Hong said.
Yoon’s critics have accused him of failing to resolve livelihood issues such as soaring prices, refusing to quickly fire some top officials implicated in scandals, and lacking efforts to communicate with opposition leaders for policy coordination.
Earlier this year, Yoon briefly enjoyed rising approval ratings over his strong push to drastically increase the number of medical students despite vehement protests by incumbent doctors. But the doctors’ walkouts eventually left Yoon facing growing calls to find a compromise, with patients and others experiencing delays of surgeries and other inconveniences.
The rival parties’ campaigning ahead of Wednesday’s elections deepened South Korea’s already serious conservative-liberal divide as they exchanged toxic rhetoric and mudslinging.
Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon in the country’s most closely fought presidential contest. During the 2022 race, Yoon and Lee and their supporters spent months demonizing each other.
Lee is eyeing another presidential bid. His main potential conservative rival is Han, who also served as Yoon’s justice minister. Lee faces an array of corruption investigations that he argues are politically motivated and pushed by Yoon’s government.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,25,EXPLAINER-Why is Japan seeking a summit with nuclear-armed North Korea?,"United States President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he supported his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida's attempts to hold face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I have faith in Japan,"" Biden told reporters during Kishida's state visit to Washington this week. ""I think seeking a dialogue with him is a good thing.""
Kishida hopes to become the first Japanese leader in 20 years to hold leadership talks with nuclear-armed Pyongyang, but his prospects of doing so remain unclear. WHY IS JAPAN SEEKING A SUMMIT?
While Kishida says he is willing to hold talks without preconditions, the burning issue he wants to resolve is that of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s. The Japanese government has said 17 people were kidnapped by the reclusive state. Five returned to Japan in 2002 following previous summit talks, but 12 still remain unaccounted for.
North Korea has said the issue is settled. It has previously said that the unaccounted Japanese nationals had either died, or that it knew nothing about their whereabouts. Resolving the abductee issue has broad public support and Japan is being spurred to take action while the elderly family members of the abductees are still alive.
The poster child of the abductees, Megumi Yokota, was just 13 when she was kidnapped while walking home from school in 1977. Her mother continues to lobby for her return despite North Korea saying she committed suicide. At a meeting with the families last May, Kishida said he would directly oversee high-level discussions with North Korean counterparts to try and realise the summit.
IS NORTH KOREA OPEN TO IT? North Korea has so far been non-committal on Kishida's repeated calls for a summit.
Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea's leader, said in February there is no impediment to closer ties with Japan and there may come a day when Kishida visits Pyongyang, state news agency KCNA reported. Japan said it would not comment on the statement but added North Korea's position that the abduction issue had been resolved was unacceptable.
A month later, Kim Yo Jong issued another statement saying North Korea had no interest in a summit with Japan and would reject any talks, according to KCNA. Kim accused Tokyo of ""clinging to the unattainable issues,"" the KCNA report said.
HAS A SUMMIT HAPPENED BEFORE? In a historic first, then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi travelled to Pyongyang to meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Il in 2002.
Although North Korea denied any involvement in the abductee issue, the 2002 summit proved to be a breakthrough with Kim Jong Il admitting to some of the abductions. Koizumi and Kim Jong Il met again in Pyongyang in 2004, the last leadership talks between the two countries.
Although Japanese and North Korean officials have had meetings since, ties have soured over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes, with the North conducting a number of test launches and Japan labelling the country a threat to regional stability. COULD IT BACKFIRE?
With North Korea refusing to engage if the abductee issue is on the negotiating table, Kishida risks coming home empty-handed should he visit Pyongyang. A failure to provide any tangible wins from engaging with a nuclear-armed state that has continued to launch missiles into waters surrounding Japan could hurt Kishida's already low domestic approval ratings.
Although Kishida has expressed his desire to meet with Kim Jong Un as early as possible, some government officials say privately it could be a politically risky gambit.

FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,26,South Korea PM 'offers to resign' after opposition wins landslide midterm parliamentary vote,"South Korea's liberal opposition party has won by a landslide in parliamentary elections - with senior ruling party politicians reportedly offering to resign following the crushing defeat.
The results of Wednesday's election are a huge political blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has three years left in office.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Mr Yoon's top advisers tendered their resignations, according to South Korean media, including Yonhap news agency.

In a separate news conference, Han Dong-hoon, leader of the ruling conservative People Power Party who spearheaded its election campaign, said he would step down to take responsibility for the defeat.
""I apologise to the people on behalf of our party, which wasn't good enough to win the people's choices,"" he said.

Mr Yoon said he would ""humbly"" accept the result of the election - widely considered a midterm referendum on his presidency - and pledged to improve people's economic situations and reform state affairs.

With most of the votes counted, the main opposition Democratic Party - led by Lee Jae-myung - and its satellite party appeared to have won a combined 175 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.
A splinter liberal party considered allied with the DP was expected to take 12 seats, projections showed.
However, the outcome leaves the bloc short of the 200 seats needed for a super-majority which would have given it legislative powers to overturn vetoes and even impeach the president.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,27,Kim Jong Un Threatens North Korea's Enemies With 'Death Blow',"A bullish Kim Jong Un toured North Korea's top military institute on Wednesday and reaffirmed his goal of creating the ""world's strongest army,"" state media said, amid sky high tensions with the United States and its allies.
Kim, 40, visited Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics—named for his father—for the first time since it opened a decade ago, urging cadets at the elite academy to perfect the art of winning wars, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday.
1 of 2
North Korea's strongman leader described the global environment as one of ""ever-escalating violence and armed conflicts,"" and the regional situation around his country as ""insecure and unstable,"" the KCNA said.
""[N]ow is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before,"" Kim was quoted as saying, adding that ""the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] should be more firmly and perfectly prepared for a war.""
If North Korea's enemy ""opts for military confrontation,"" Kim reportedly said, without naming any country, ""the DPRK will deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilizing all means in its possession.""
The KCNA report was published a day after South Korea held its general election, in which the main opposition Democratic Party won a landslide parliamentary majority over the conservative People Power Party of President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Seoul accused Pyongyang of interfering in the vote with ""provocations.""
KCNA photographs of Kim's university tour showed him inspecting a raised-relief map of Seoul and aerial images of air bases used by American and South Korean forces.
He has discussed military plans in front of maps of South Korea on seven occasions in the last two years, according to the specialist website NK News.
1 of 2
In the past few weeks, Kim has been photographed personally leading tank, artillery and paratrooper drills—all described by state media as defensive measures against the U.S.-South Korea alliance.
Kim also has kept up a steady streak of ballistic missile tests, largely ignoring the long list of U.N. Security Council sanctions levied on his government in the past decade.
Long-time observers say Kim is likely to continue as the United States heads into its own presidential election this fall, with a view to extracting concessions for his troubled economy.
Washington has accused Moscow and Beijing of offering Pyongyang political cover by vetoing further punitive measures at the Security Council. In addition, Russia is alleged to have received North Korean weapons for use in Ukraine in exchange for assisting in Kim's burgeoning military satellite program.
Both North Korea and Russia have repeatedly denied trading arms, which would be a further violation of U.N. sanctions.
Kim may be on a war footing, analysts say, but he is not short of friends.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,28,It's time to be ready for war': North Korea's Kim Jong Un as tensions with rivals escalate,"Follow us on Image Source : REUTERS North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits a military university in Pyongyang.
Pyongyang: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un asserted that now is the time to be more prepared for war than ever due to unstable geopolitical situations surrounding his country, as he inspected a military university, according to state-controlled media KCNA on Thursday. This comes as Pyongyang's tensions with rivals South Korea and the US as on the rise as both countries continue to hold joint military drills, which North Korea sees as a rehearsal for invasion.
Kim gave field guidance on Wednesday at the Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics, named after his father who died in 2011, which KCNA said is the ""highest seat of military education"" in the country. He told the university staff and students that ""if the enemy opts for a military confrontation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the DPRK will deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilising all means in its possession"".
""Outlining the complicated international situation ... and the uncertain and unstable military and political situation around the DPRK, he said that now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before,"" KCNA said. North Korea has stepped up weapons development in recent years under Kim and has forged closer military and political ties with Russia, allegedly aiding Moscow in its war with Ukraine in return for help with strategic military projects.
Tensions between North Korea and its rivals
North Korea has accused the United States and South Korea of provoking military tensions by conducting what it called ""war manoeuvres"" as the allies have conducted military drills with greater intensity and scale in recent months. Last week, Pyongyang said it had tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, the latest in its series of weapons tests as part of nuclear war preparations against its neighbours and the United States.
The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets. The countries have also warned that they would swiftly retaliate against any attack by North Korea as it ramps up its nuclear rhetoric, further flaring up tensions.
Last week, hours after the launch of North Korea's missile, Seoul’s Defense Ministry announced that South Korea, the United States and Japan conducted a combined aerial exercise above waters near Jeju island that involved at least one nuclear-capable US B-52 bomber. The US has been increasing its deployment of strategic assets to the region, also including aircraft carriers and missile-firing submarines, in a show of force against North Korea, in recent months.
Moreover, South Korea has launched its second military spy satellite into space, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year. The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year – North Korea in November and South Korea in December — amid heightened animosities. Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025.
What does North Korea seek?
Notably, Pyongyang has been testing hypersonic missiles to fly at the speed of sound since 2021 and these systems can pose a challenge to regional missile defense systems because of their speed and maneuverability if perfected. However, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff accused North Korea of exaggerating the flight performance of the missile launched last week, although acknowledging that the North’s technologies were improving.
“Hypersonic missiles are weapons systems that are still being developed by advanced nations (the United States, China and Russia etc.) and they require highly difficult technologies,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters. “It’s difficult to predict when they will be deployed operationally, but it’s expected to take a considerable amount of time.”
Last month, North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles as part of its renewed weapons test, raising tensions after the conclusion of US-South Korean military drills. The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month. Experts predicted earlier that North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.

SEOUL, April 11 (UPI) -- South Korean voters delivered a stinging rebuke to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol and his People Power Party in midterm parliamentary elections, official results confirmed Thursday, sending the opposition Democratic Party to a landslide victory. With all votes counted from Wednesday's polls, the Democratic Party and its satellite party claimed 175 out of 300 seats in the National Assembly, holding onto a majority that will impede Yoon's agenda for the remaining three years of his mandatory single five-year term. Advertisement
Yoon's People Power Party and its allies claimed only 108 seats in the unicameral legislature.
The opposition bloc was further bolstered by a strong showing from the new Rebuilding Korea Party, led by scandal-hit former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, which won 12 seats.
""I will humbly uphold the will of the people as shown in the general election,"" Yoon said Thursday, as quoted by presidential chief of staff Lee Kwan-seop at a press conference. ""I will reform the state administration and do my best to stabilize the economy and enhance people's livelihoods.""

The vote was widely seen as a midterm referendum on Yoon, who has been saddled with low approval ratings over his handling of a wide range of issues from sky-high housing prices and soaring food costs to concerns over the country's plunging birth rate, which is the lowest in the world.
Yoon's gaffe over the price of green onions during a visit to a supermarket last month became a rallying cry of his opponents, who accused the president of being out of touch with the concerns of everyday people.
The former prosecutor has also been at the center of a standoff with striking trainee doctors that has dragged on since February, while his administration has been beset by corruption allegations, including a highly publicized scandal around first lady Kim Keon Hee accepting the gift of a Dior bag.
Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung said Thursday that the party would take the lead in working to resolve economic issues after its landslide victory.
""The outcome of the general election is not a victory for the Democratic Party, but a great victory for the people,"" Lee said at an election task force event.
""The Democratic Party will do its utmost to uphold the precious will contained in each vote exercised by the people,"" he said. ""We will do our best to alleviate the suffering of people's livelihoods and resolve the national crisis.""

Lee is battling corruption accusations of his own and is currently facing trials over a range of charges including bribery.
Yoon took office in 2022 after edging out Lee by a razor-thin margin. The Democratic Party has held a majority in parliament since 2020, however, severely hampering Yoon's efforts to push through economic reforms that include taking on labor unions and reducing regulations on businesses.
Yoon has had more success establishing his agenda on the foreign policy front, where Seoul has taken a harder line against North Korea and strengthened security cooperation with the United States and Japan.

South Korea’s opposition parties scored a resounding victory in the country’s parliamentary elections held on Wednesday. Most of the votes have been counted. The main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party are projected to have secured 175 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. Meanwhile, President Yoon Suk Yeol’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) and its satellite party were projected to have obtained 109 seats.
The results have caused a stir in the ruling People Power Party (PPP).

Inside South Korean government: A flurry of resignations
On Thursday, South Korea’s Prime Minister, Han Duk-soo, handed his resignation to President Yoon. The PPP’s leader, Han Dong-hoon, too, tendered his resignation.
Additionally, all the presidential advisers, excluding those responsible for security issues, submitted their resignations to Yoon. Whether their resignations have been accepted or not remains unclear.
For the remaining three years of his term, Yoon is likely to be in hot water.
Trouble mounts for President Yoon Suk Yeol
President Yoon, who came to power in 2022, is no stranger to a liberal opposition-controlled parliament. That had already limited his sway over policy and legislation in the country. The latest results mean that he will face an even more intense political offensive by his opponents.
Not only will Yoon remain a lame duck in this term, his future political prospects are likely to suffer, too. Yoon’s approval ratings in South Korea have dropped amid a cost-of-living crisis and a spate of corruption allegations.
Failing this parliamentary election, which was seen as a mid-term confidence vote for Yoon’s government, clearly indicates the popular sentiment in South Korea.
No impeachment, at least

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,32,Be ready for war': Kim Jong Un orders North Korea's military as tensions escalate with South,"The proclamation from the draconian leader came after he inspected the country’s main military university
As the tensions in the Korean peninsula continue to escalate, North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un said that now is the time for the hermit nations to be prepared for war.
According to North Korean news outlet KCNA, the proclamation from the draconian leader came after he inspected the country’s main military university. The supreme leader gave field guidance on Wednesday at the Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics.
Advertisement
The university was named after his father who passed away in 2011 and is touted as the “highest seat of military education” in the country.
North Korea ramps up its defence
In recent years, Pyongyang has stepped up weapons development including the test firing of several ballistic and cruise missiles. Not only this, Kim has also forged closer military and political ties with Russia allegedly aiding Moscow in its war with Ukraine.
In return, Russia is helping the hermit nation in developing several strategic military projects.
During his address at the university, Kim told his staff and students that “if the enemy opts for a military confrontation with the DPRK (, the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) will deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilizing all means in its possession,” KCNA reported.
As per the reports, he went on to outline the “complicated international situation” and uncertain political situation around the DPRK.
The recent call for war preparation came a month after Kim supervised the test launch of a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile that uses solid fuel. Analysts believe that the missile would bolster North Korea’s ability to deploy missiles more effectively than the liquid-fuel variants.
All these developments have raised concerns among South Korea and the United States. Amid the brewing tensions, North Korea has accused both nations of “provoking military tensions” by conducting “war manoeuvres”.
North Korea’s growing ties with Russia
As Kim continues to ask his military to prepare for war, the nation can be seen forging strong ties with Russia. Last month, Russia announced that it would be shutting down a panel of United Nations experts who have been monitoring international sanctions against Pyongyang.

The decision came a week after the panel revealed last week that it is probing reports of Russia violating rules by buying North Korean weapons like ballistic missiles for use in its ongoing war against Ukraine.
The United Nations Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions on Pyongyang since 2006 for its nuclear weapon programme. While those sanctions will still be in place, the expert group which was set up to monitor the violations will now be disbanded by Russia.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,33,China is sending its highest-level delegation to North Korea since 2019 to kick off a ‘friendship year’,"By Simone McCarthy, CNN
Hong Kong (CNN) — China’s highest-level visit to North Korea in nearly five years is set to get underway Thursday, as Pyongyang seeks to strengthen relations with both Beijing and Moscow amid growing coordination between its neighbors and the United States.
Zhao Leji, China’s third-highest ranked official, will lead a delegation for a “goodwill visit” to the country to kickstart a “friendship year” marking 75 years of diplomatic ties, Beijing announced Tuesday.
The three-day visit, at North Korea’s invitation, shows the “great importance” China attaches to those relations, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. North Korea’s state media agency KCNA also announced the visit.
It also affords a top Chinese official the opportunity to hear directly from North Korea’s intensely secretive and isolated government while on the ground, analysts say.
Zhao is the highest-ranking Chinese visitor to the country since a state visit from Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2019. Zhao leads China’s rubber-stamp national legislature and is a member of its powerful seven-man Politburo Standing Committee.
The trip comes as both countries are wary of what they see as an increasingly hostile region – in particular growing security coordination between the US and its allies Japan and South Korea, which in turn seek to counter aggression from Beijing and Pyongyang.
The delegation will also arrive amid heightened global concern about North Korea, which has in recent months ramped up its bellicose rhetoric and continued its weapons testing. Pyongyang has also forged closer ties with Moscow, and begun supplying arms used in its war in Ukraine, the US and its allies say.
Those geopolitical fault lines are underscored as the Chinese delegation’s visit coincides with a raft of Asia-focused diplomacy in Washington this week.
US President Joe Biden is hosting a trilateral summit with the Philippines and Japan Thursday, a day after a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida where they pledged to advance coordination around countering challenges from China and North Korea.
In an interview with CNN ahead of that meeting, Kishida referred to China and North Korea’s close ties with Russia and urged them to “maintain a free and open international order based on the rule of law.”

As the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s No. 3 official below Xi and Premier Li Qiang, Zhao’s “goodwill” mission carries more weight than a visit from a government-level minister.
The visit is not expected to usher in diplomatic developments but will be an opportunity for China to reinforce its own deep and complex ties with North Korea – and convey to the US and the region that it has leverage there.
“(At a time) when the United States is trying to work more closely with Japan and South Korea, China wants to signal its own influence,” said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor at Hong Kong’s City University.
The trip could also be an important opportunity for the upper echelons of China’s political establishment to better understand the circumstances in North Korea today.
Only handful of Chinese officials have visited the country since it eased pandemic controls last year – a period during which Pyongyang has ramped up rhetoric around its nuclear weapons development and unveiled a major policy shift away from seeking reunification with South Korea.
“China probably needs to understand what’s happening and what’s the real intention of the North Korean leader … given that (North Korea) just recovered from Covid and shifted its policies … apart from routine communication, China needs to get more information,” Liu said.
For North Korea, the visit provides an opportunity to tighten its ties with its most important international partner, as it seeks to bolster itself against expanding drills and security cooperation between the US and South Korea, which Kim sees as a threat to his regime.
Balance of power
China has long walked a thin line in its relations with North Korea.
It is a critical economic lifeline for a North Korea crippled by international sanctions over its illegal weapons testing. The two also have close historical and ideological ties and fought together during the Korean War of the 1950s.
Today, Beijing stands to benefit when US attention is drawn away from itself and toward Pyongyang’s provocative rhetoric and weapons testing. But it also has a strong interest in ensuring that Kim’s posturing doesn’t spark a potentially devastating conflict in the region – or draw more US forces there.
“When China’s regional geopolitical situation (has) deteriorated, you will see China became a lot more supportive or accommodating to North Korea,” said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.
“When China feels the geopolitical pressures from the US and from regional states in Asia-Pacific becoming less, you will see stronger desire on the part of Beijing to put pressure on North Korea’s nuclear policy, missile policy,” he said.
China is also likely paying close attention to the enhanced cooperation between North Korea and Russia, where Kim made a visit last year to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Beijing, which has expanded economic, diplomatic and security ties with Russia following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, has declined to comment on any transfer of arms transfer from North Korea to Russia, calling their cooperation a “matter between those two sovereign states.”
It also abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote last month to extend monitoring North Korea’s violations of UN sanctions. The measure was vetoed by Russia.
But while the three authoritarian countries share security concerns and opposition to the American network of alliances, Beijing is also wary of any optics that it’s forming an axis with Russia and North Korea, according to Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.
“China doesn’t want to return to an iron triangle with North Korea and Russia,” and also may not want to see Pyongyang’s relations with Moscow dilute its own influence, she said.
“But China plays a critical and irreplaceable role in both economies and the Russia-(North Korea) rapprochement has not threatened or damaged China’s interests yet.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,34,China is sending its highest-level delegation to North Korea since 2019 to kick off a ‘friendship year’,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
Hong Kong CNN —
China’s highest-level visit to North Korea in nearly five years is set to get underway Thursday, as Pyongyang seeks to strengthen relations with both Beijing and Moscow amid growing coordination between its neighbors and the United States.
Zhao Leji, China’s third-highest ranked official, will lead a delegation for a “goodwill visit” to the country to kickstart a “friendship year” marking 75 years of diplomatic ties, Beijing announced Tuesday.
The three-day visit, at North Korea’s invitation, shows the “great importance” China attaches to those relations, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. North Korea’s state media agency KCNA also announced the visit.
It also affords a top Chinese official the opportunity to hear directly from North Korea’s intensely secretive and isolated government while on the ground, analysts say.
Zhao is the highest-ranking Chinese visitor to the country since a state visit from Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2019. Zhao leads China’s rubber-stamp national legislature and is a member of its powerful seven-man Politburo Standing Committee.
The trip comes as both countries are wary of what they see as an increasingly hostile region – in particular growing security coordination between the US and its allies Japan and South Korea, which in turn seek to counter aggression from Beijing and Pyongyang.
The delegation will also arrive amid heightened global concern about North Korea, which has in recent months ramped up its bellicose rhetoric and continued its weapons testing. Pyongyang has also forged closer ties with Moscow, and begun supplying arms used in its war in Ukraine, the US and its allies say.
Those geopolitical fault lines are underscored as the Chinese delegation’s visit coincides with a raft of Asia-focused diplomacy in Washington this week.
US President Joe Biden is hosting a trilateral summit with the Philippines and Japan Thursday, a day after a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida where they pledged to advance coordination around countering challenges from China and North Korea.
In an interview with CNN ahead of that meeting, Kishida referred to China and North Korea’s close ties with Russia and urged them to “maintain a free and open international order based on the rule of law.”

FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,39,South Korea's prime minister and top presidential officials offer to resign after election defeat,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s prime minister and senior presidential officials offered to resign en masse on Thursday, after their conservative ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections.
The results of Wednesday’s elections were a huge political blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol, likely setting back his domestic agenda and leave him facing an intensifying political offensive by his liberal opponents during his remaining three years in office.
Prime Minster Han Duck-soo and all senior presidential advisers to Yoon, except those in charge of security issues, submitted their resignations, according to Yoon's office. It didn't immediately say whether Yoon accepted their resignations.
Executive power in South Korea is heavily concentrated in the president, but the prime minister is the No. 2 official and leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated.
Yoon said he will “humbly uphold” the public sentiments reflected in the election outcome and focus on improving people's economic situations and on reforming state affairs, according to his office.
In a separate news conference, ruling People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon said he would step down as well to take responsibility for the election defeat.
With most of the votes counted, the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party appeared to have won a combined 175 seats in the 300-member National Assembly. Another small liberal opposition party was expected to win 12 seats under a proportional representation system, according to South Korean media tallies.
Yoon’s ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to have obtained 109 seats.
The final official results were expected later Thursday.
But the outcome means the liberal opposition forces will extend their control of the parliament, though they likely won't have the super majority of 200 seats that would give them the power to overturn vetoes and even impeach the president.
Wednesday’s election was widely seen as a midterm confidence vote on Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term.
He has pushed hard to boost cooperation with the U.S. and Japan as a way to address a mix of tough security and economic challenges. But Yoon has been grappling with low approval ratings at home and a liberal opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his major policy platforms.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,41,"South Korea's Opposition notches landslide win, scandal-plagued leader becomes election's big winner","The thunderous performance of the liberal parties has delivered a massive blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol’s conservative party
South Korea’s liberal opposition parties garnered a landslide victory in the country’s highly intense parliamentary elections which was held on Wednesday.
The thunderous performance of the liberal parties has delivered a massive blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol’s conservative party. According to The Guardian, the Democratic Party (DP) was projected to take more than 170 of the 300 seats in the new legislature.
South Korea’s National Election Commission has maintained that more than 99 per cent of the votes have been counted by Thursday morning. Hence, the results are less likely to change.

Meanwhile, Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) was projected to win a little over 100 seats. The vote was widely seen as a midterm referendum on the South Korean president who still has three years left in office.
The insignificance of the landslide win
It is important to note that both the main parties in South Korea use breakaway satellite parties to maximise their votes under South Korea’s electoral system.
Despite DP’s electoral success, the opposition party is still expected to miss out on forming a two-thirds supermajority, which would have allowed them to override the presidential vetoes and pass constitutional amendments.
Controversial opposition leader becomes a big election winner
While the results still prevent the opposition from putting on a strong front against the ruling party, it has the potential to embolden the status of DP leader Lee Jae-Myung.
The controversy-stricken leader narrowly lost the presidential election to Yoon back in 2022. Hence, the win gives life to his future presidential campaign.
“When voters chose me, it was your judgment against the Yoon Suk Yeol administration and you are giving the Democratic party the duty to take responsibility for the livelihood of the people and create a better society,"" the DP leader averred after the electoral win.
Lee won a seat in the South Korean city of Incheon, which is located to the west of the Capital Seoul. He was fighting against a conservative heavyweight who was considered the major ally of President Yoon.

Pressure on the Yoon administration intensifies
Before his government headed to the polls, the Yoon administration had been under major pressure to address a number of issues which included food prices, the ageing population and the ongoing doctor’s strike.
In recent weeks, the South Korean leader has been criticised for appearing “out of touch” with the impact of inflation on the daily lives of common people.
He received a major backlash last month after he commented that a bundle of green onions priced at 875 won at a South Korean supermarket was “reasonable”.
The item has been priced at a discount because of subsidies and would normally cost between 3,000 and 4,000 won. The comment sparked major condemnation and dissenters used bundles of green onions as props at the farmers’ protests and even at the DP election rally.

South Korean first lady remains missing from public light
Meanwhile, South Korean First Lady Kim Keon Hee has not been seen in public since December 15 sparking major speculations. She was also absent when Yoon cast his vote this week.
It is pertinent to note that Yoon’s wife has been embroiled in a controversy for allegedly accepting a luxury bag as a gift.

South Korea's Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and other senior aides offered their resignation to President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday, said news agency Reuters citing the Yonhap news agency.
The development comes after the ruling party's heavy defeat in parliamentary elections.
South Korea’s liberal opposition parties appeared set to win a landslide victory in Wednesday’s parliamentary election, vote counts showed, a result that could make conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol a lame duck for his remaining three years in office.
With most of the votes cast counted, the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party appear to have won a combined 175 seats in the 300-member National Assembly. Another small liberal opposition party was expected to win 12 seats under a proportional representation system, according to South Korean media tallies.
Yoon’s ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to have obtained 109 seats. The final official results were expected later Thursday. But the outcome means the liberal opposition forces would extend their control of the parliament, though they will likely fail to garner the super majority of 200 seats that gives them legislative powers to pass bills vetoed by a president and even impeach him or her.
Wednesday’s election was widely seen as a mid-term confidence vote on Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term.
He has pushed hard to boost cooperation with the U.S. and Japan as a way to address a mix of tough security and economic challenges. But Yoon has been grappling with low approval ratings at home and a liberal opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his major policy platforms.
Regardless of the results, Yoon will stay in power and his major foreign policies will likely be unchanged. But the ruling party’s big election defeat could set back Yoon’s domestic agenda and leave him facing an intensifying political offensive by his liberal opponents.
Exit polls sponsored by South Korea’s major TV stations earlier predicted a bigger win by the opposition parties.
“We did our best to do politics that follow public sentiments, but results of exit polls are disappointing,” ruling party Han Dong-hoon said in televised comments. “We’ll watch ballot counting to the end.”
After gathering to watch TV broadcasts showing results of the exit polls, Democratic Party members cheered and clapped their hands. “We’ll humbly watch the people’s choices to the end. Thanks much!” party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters.
Ahead of the election, the conservatives and their liberal rivals exchanged toxic rhetoric and mudslinging. Their mutual contempt deepened during the 2022 presidential election, during which Yoon and Lee, then the Democratic Party candidate, spent months demonizing each other. Yoon eventually beat Lee in the country’s most closely fought presidential contest.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,43,South Korea midterm election: Opposition wins landslide parliamentary vote in resounding blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol,"Seoul, South Korea — South Korea’s liberal opposition parties scored a landslide victory in a parliamentary election held on Wednesday, dealing a resounding blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol and his conservative party but likely falling just short of a super majority.
The Democratic Party (DP) was projected to take more than 170 of the 300 seats in the new legislature, data by the National Election Commission and network broadcasters showed with more than 99% of the votes counted as of 5:55 a.m. on Thursday (5.55 p.m. ET Wednesday).
A splinter liberal party considered allied with the DP was expected to take at least 10 seats, projections showed.
“When voters chose me, it was your judgment against the Yoon Suk Yeol administration and you are giving the Democratic Party the duty to take responsibility for the livelihood of the people and create a better society,” DP leader Lee Jae-myung said.
Lee won a seat in the city of Incheon to the west of the capital, Seoul, against a conservative heavyweight candidate considered a major ally of the president.
The bitterly fought race was seen by some analysts as a referendum on Yoon, whose popularity has suffered amid a cost-of-living crisis and a spate of political scandals.
“Judgment” was the common theme running through comments by opposition victors, many of whom had campaigned heavily focused on what they said was Yoon’s mismanagement of the economy and his refusal to acknowledge his wife acted improperly when she accepted a Dior bag as gift.
First lady Kim Keon Hee has not been seen in public since Dec. 15 and was absent when Yoon voted, reflecting the view by some analysts and opposition party members that she had become a serious political liability for the president and his PPP.
His People Power Party (PPP) was projected to win just over 100 seats, meaning Yoon would avoid the super-majority of a two-third opposition control that could break presidential vetoes and pass constitutional amendments.
But nearing the end of the first two years of his five-year single term allowed by the constitution, Yoon was likely to slip into a lame duck status, some analysts said.
The National Election Commission (NEC) was expected to announce the official results later on Thursday. Nearly 29.7 million people, or 67% of eligible voters, cast their ballots, according to the NEC.
It marked the highest ever turnout for a parliamentary election, though the numbers were down from the 2022 presidential vote that narrowly brought Yoon to power.

Yoon, who took office in May 2022, was not up for election this time but his ability to pass legislation is likely to be badly damaged by the poor showing by his PPP.
He has suffered low ratings for months, hamstrung in implementing his pledges to cut taxes, ease business regulations and expand family support in the world’s fastest aging society.
Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said Yoon might focus more on his overseas agenda now, though those plans could also be at risk if the opposition seeks to cut budgets with its majority.
“Given his likely lame duck status, the temptation for Yoon will be to focus on foreign policy where he will still have statutory power,” Richey said.",2024-04-11 02:18:41,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network,43,south korea south liberal opposition scored landslide victory parliamentary election dealing resounding blow president conservative party likely falling short super democratic party take 170 300 new legislature data national election commission network 99 555 555 splinter liberal party considered allied take least 10 chose judgment administration giving democratic party duty take responsibility livelihood people create better society leader lee seat city west capital conservative heavyweight candidate considered major ally bitterly fought race seen referendum whose popularity amid crisis spate political common theme running opposition many heavily said mismanagement economy refusal acknowledge wife improperly accepted bag lady kim seen public since 15 absent reflecting view opposition party become serious political liability president people power party win 100 meaning would avoid opposition control could break presidential pas constitutional end first two single term constitution likely slip lame duck status national election commission announce official later nearly 297 million people 67 eligible cast according marked highest ever turnout parliamentary election though 2022 presidential vote narrowly brought leader democratic party election district office south korea 11 2024 took office may 2022 election time ability pas legislation likely badly poor showing low cut ease business expand family support aging professor university foreign said might focus overseas agenda though could also risk opposition cut likely lame duck status temptation focus foreign policy still statutory power said south korea election opposition landslide parliamentary vote resounding blow president

Kim gave field guidance on Wednesday at Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics, named after his father who died in 2011, which KCNA said is the “highest seat of military education” in the country.
North Korea has stepped up weapons development in recent years under Kim and has forged closer military and political ties with Russia, allegedly aiding Moscow in its war with Ukraine in return for help with strategic military projects.

“Outlining the complicated international situation ... and the uncertain and unstable military and political situation around the DPRK, he said that now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before,” KCNA said.
Earlier this month, Kim supervised the test launch of a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile using solid fuel, which analysts said would bolster the North’s ability to deploy missiles more effectively than liquid-fuel variants.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,45,South Korea: landslide win for opposition in parliamentary vote amid anger over economy,"South Korea’s liberal opposition parties scored a landslide victory in a parliamentary election held on Wednesday, dealing a resounding blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol and his conservative party but likely falling just short of a super majority.
The Democratic party (DP) was projected to take more than 170 of the 300 seats in the new legislature, data by the National Election Commission and network broadcasters showed with more than 99% of the votes counted on Thursday morning.
Yoon’s People Power party (PPP) was projected to win just over 100 seats, meaning Yoon would avoid the super-majority of two-thirds opposition control that could break presidential vetoes and pass constitutional amendments.
But nearing the end of the first two years of his five-year single term allowed by the constitution, Yoon was likely to slip into a lame duck status, some analysts said.
A splinter liberal party loosely allied with the opposition DP was expected to take at least 10 seats, projections showed.
DP leader Lee Jae-myung said: “When voters chose me, it was your judgment against the Yoon Suk Yeol administration and you are giving the Democratic party the duty to take responsibility for the livelihood of the people and create a better society.”

Lee won a seat in the city of Incheon to the west of the capital, Seoul, against a conservative heavyweight candidate considered a major ally of the president.
The bitterly fought race was seen by some analysts as a referendum on Yoon, whose popularity has suffered amid a cost-of-living crisis and a spate of political scandals.
“Judgment” was the common theme running through comments by opposition victors, many of whom had campaigned heavily focused on what they said was Yoon’s mismanagement of the economy and his refusal to acknowledge his wife acted improperly when she accepted a Dior bag as a gift.
First lady Kim Keon Hee has not been seen in public since 15 December and was absent when Yoon voted, reflecting the view by some analysts and opposition party members that she had become a serious political liability for the president and his party.
The vote was also a success for minor parties that capitalised on public discontent with the established parties. The new Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk, was projected to win 12-14 seats, despite being formed only a month ago.
“The figures today show the strong anger of people at Yoon for his two-year governance,” political analyst Yum Seung-yul told Agence France-Presse.
“What if he won’t change even with this stunning election outcome? I think there will be even more public anger and that worries me.”
The National Election Commission (NEC) was expected to announce the official results later on Thursday. Nearly 29.7 million people, or 67% of eligible voters, cast their ballots, according to the NEC.
It marked the highest ever turnout for a parliamentary election, though the numbers were down from the 2022 presidential vote that narrowly brought Yoon to power.
Yoon, who took office in May 2022, was not up for election this time but his ability to pass legislation is likely to be badly damaged by the poor showing by his PPP.
He has suffered low ratings for months, hamstrung in implementing his pledges to cut taxes, ease business regulations and expand family support in the world’s fastest ageing society.
Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said Yoon might focus more on his overseas agenda now, though those plans could also be at risk if the opposition seeks to cut budgets with its majority.
“Given his likely lame duck status, the temptation for Yoon will be to focus on foreign policy where he will still have statutory power,” Richey said.

The results of Wednesday’s election posed a huge political blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol, setting back his domestic agenda and leaving him facing an intensifying political offensive by his liberal opponents during his remaining three years in office.

South Korean media, including Yonhap news agency, reported that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Mr Yoon’s top advisers submitted their resignations.
Mr Yoon’s office did not immediately officially confirm the reports.
In a separate news conference, ruling People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon said he would also step down to take responsibility for the election defeat.

With most of the votes counted, the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party appear to have won a combined 175 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.
According to South Korean media tallies, another small liberal opposition party was expected to win 12 seats under a proportional representation system.
Mr Yoon’s ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to have obtained 109 seats.

The final official results were expected later on Thursday.
But the outcome means the liberal opposition forces would extend their control of the parliament, though they will likely fail to garner the super majority of 200 seats that gives them legislative powers to overturn vetoes and even impeach the president.
Wednesday’s election was widely seen as a midterm confidence vote on Mr Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term.
He has pushed hard to boost cooperation with the US and Japan as a way to address a mix of tough security and economic challenges.

WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Japan's attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea is “a good thing,” and reiterated his administration's willingness for its own talks without preconditions.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Biden were using the Japanese leader's official visit to Washington to spotlight strengthened defense and intelligence ties to address threats from North Korea and China. The U.S. blessing of the potential talks between Japan and North Korea comes as its own efforts to reopen a line of communication with Pyongyang have gone unrequited.

Kishida, for his part, said, “The window of a discussion with North Korea is open. He added, “The establishment of a meaningful relationship between Japan and North Korea is in the interests of both Japan and North Korea and it could be hugely beneficial to the peace and stability of the region.”
The Biden administration has repeatedly expressed openness to talks with Kim since taking office in 2021, but has never received a response.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,53,"NASA Spacecraft Snaps Korean Orbiter Zipping Past It at 7,200 MPH","NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute’s Danuri lunar orbiter crossed paths recently, and the former managed to snap a photo of the latter zipping past it at the relative velocity of 7,200 miles per hour.
The LRO has been in orbit around the Moon for the last 15 years while Danuri has been in lunar orbit since December 2022.
The two spacecraft flew past each other in opposite directions between March 5 and 6 this year and one of the LRO’s cameras, the narrow angle LROC, managed to capture photos during all three orbits where it happened to be close enough to Danuri to make such a feat possible. The closest encounter, above, gives the best view of the Korean spacecraft.
“Due to the fast relative velocities between the two spacecraft (about 7,200 miles, or 11,500 kilometers, per hour), the LRO operations team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, needed exquisite timing in pointing LROC to the right place at the right time to catch a glimpse of Danuri, the Republic of Korea’s first spacecraft at the Moon,” NASA explains.
In the photos, Danuri appears to be stretched and smeared to 10 times its size in the opposite direction of travel because of how fast the two spacecraft were flying past each other — this happened even though the LRO’s camera exposure time was exceedingly short: just 0.338 milliseconds. Neat!
More photos of the encounter can be seen on NASA’s website.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,54,"South Korea’s liberal opposition parties win big in parliamentary election, exit polls suggest","South Korea’s liberal opposition parties were expected to win a landslide victory in Wednesday’s parliamentary election, initial exit polls suggested, a result that if confirmed would make conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol a lame duck for his remaining three years in office.
The joint exit polls by South Korea’s three major TV stations — KBS, MBC and SBS — showed the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party were forecast to win combined 178-197 seats in the 300-member National Assembly. They expected another new liberal opposition party to win 12-14 seats.
The polls suggested the ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to win 85-105 seats.
Wednesday’s election was widely seen as a mid-term confidence vote on President Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term.
He has pushed hard to boost cooperation with the U.S. and Japan as a way to address a mix of tough security and economic challenges. But Yoon has been grappling with low approval ratings at home and a liberal opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his major policy platforms.
Regardless of the results, Yoon will stay in power and his major foreign policies will likely be unchanged. But the ruling party’s big election defeat could set back Yoon’s domestic agenda and leave him facing intensifying political offensive by his liberal opponents.
If the opposition parties garner combined 200 seats — two-thirds of the 300 parliamentary seats at stake — or more, they will have legislative powers to pass bills vetoed by a president and can even impeach him.
“We did our best to do politics that follow public sentiments, but results of exit polls are disappointing,” ruling party Han Dong-hoon said in televised comments. “We’ll watch ballot counting to the end.”
After looking at TV broadcasts showing results of the exit polls together, Democratic Party members cheered and clapped their hands. “We’ll humbly watch the people’s choices to the end. Thanks much!” party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters.
Of the 300 seats, 254 will be elected through direct votes in local districts, and the other 46 to the parties according to their proportion of the vote. The final voter turnout for South Korea’s 44 million eligible voters was tentatively estimated at 67%, the highest for a parliamentary election since 1992, according to the National Election Commission.

Ahead of the election, the conservatives and their liberal rivals exchanged toxic rhetoric and mudslinging. Their mutual contempt deepened during the 2022 presidential election, during which Yoon and Lee, then the Democratic Party candidate, spent months demonizing each other. Yoon eventually beat Lee in the country’s most closely fought presidential contest.
Lee is now a harsh critic of Yoon’s policies and is eying another presidential bid. His main potential conservative rival in the next presidential race is Han, an ally of Yoon who served as his justice minister. Lee faces an array of corruption investigations that he argues are politically motivated and pushed by by Yoon’s government.
There was a brief soul-searching about South Korea’s divisive politics after Lee was stabbed in the neck in January by a man who, according to police, tried to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president. But as the parliamentary election approached, the rival parties began churning out abusive rhetoric and crude insults against each other.
During the election campaigning, Han called Lee “a criminal” and labeled his past comments as “trash.” Lee’s party spokesperson described Han’s mouth as a “trash bin.” Han accused Lee of using a sexist remark against a female ruling party candidate.
Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at Kyung Hee University, predicted that the opposition parties could win a combined 150-180 seats.
“That would cause a political deadlock for the Republic of Korea for the next three years, as both the ruling and opposition parties can’t pursue things unilaterally and won’t likely make terms with each other,” Chung said.
Earlier this year, Yoon saw rising approval ratings over his strong push to drastically increase the number of medical students despite vehement protests by incumbent doctors. Yoon has said he aims to create more doctors to brace for the country’s rapidly aging population, but thousands of young doctors have gone on strike, saying that schools can’t handle an abrupt increase in students.
The doctors’ walkouts eventually left Yoon facing growing calls to find a compromise, with patients and others experiencing delays of surgeries and other inconveniences. Yoon’s ruling party has also been struggling with rising prices of agricultural products and other goods and criticism of Yoon’s personnel management style.
“This election is an assessment of Yoon’s presidency. The stakes for him are whether he’s able to fully implement his liberal democratic agenda, which is his top priority,” Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, said. “He and his party have criticized the previous progressive party for democratic backsliding.”",2024-04-10 13:11:43,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News,54,south liberal opposition win landslide victory parliamentary election initial exit result confirmed would make conservative president lame duck three joint exit south three major main opposition democratic party satellite party forecast win combined 178197 300member national assembly another new liberal opposition party win 1214 ruling people power party satellite party win 85105 election widely seen confidence vote president former top prosecutor took office 2022 single hard boost u japan way address mix tough security economic grappling low approval home liberal parliament limited major policy stay power major foreign likely unchanged ruling big election defeat could set back domestic agenda leave facing political offensive liberal opposition garner combined 200 300 parliamentary stake legislative pas president even impeach best politics follow public exit disappointing ruling party han said well watch ballot counting looking showing exit together democratic party cheered clapped well humbly watch end thanks much party leader lee told 300 254 direct local 46 according proportion vote final voter turnout south 44 million eligible tentatively 67 highest parliamentary election since 1992 according national election election commission sort parliamentary election south korea 10 2024 lee election liberal toxic rhetoric mudslinging mutual contempt 2022 presidential election lee democratic party candidate spent eventually beat lee closely fought presidential harsh critic eying another presidential bid main potential conservative rival next presidential race han ally justice minister lee array corruption politically brief south divisive politics lee neck man according police tried kill lee prevent becoming president parliamentary election rival churning abusive rhetoric crude election han lee criminal past trash lee party mouth trash bin han accused lee remark female ruling party former dean graduate school international university opposition could win combined 150180 would cause political deadlock republic korea next three ruling opposition cant pursue unilaterally wont likely make year saw rising approval strong push drastically increase number medical despite vehement incumbent said create brace rapidly aging population young gone strike saying cant handle abrupt increase eventually left facing growing find compromise ruling party also struggling rising agricultural good criticism personnel management election assessment presidency whether able fully implement liberal democratic agenda top priority kim senior analyst center new security said party previous progressive party democratic south liberal opposition win big parliamentary election exit suggest

FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,56,South Korea opposition set for big win in legislative election in blow to Yoon,"South Korea's main opposition party and its allies were projected to win a majority in Wednesday's elections for the country's legislature, exit polls showed, in what would mark a significant blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol. A joint poll released by broadcasters KBS, MBC and SBS estimated that the opposition Democratic Party (DP) and its minor allies could secure between 183-197 seats in the single-chamber, 300-seat parliament, and Yoon's conservative People Power Party (PPP) and its affiliates would win 85-100.
Another poll conducted by cable network JTBC showed the opposition camp was likely to get 168-193 seats, while it put the PPP coalition on 87-111. The bitterly fought race was seen by some analysts as a referendum on Yoon, whose popularity has suffered amid a cost-of-living crisis and a spate of political scandals.
Official results are not expected to be released until the early hours of Thursday, but exits polls in previous elections have given a broadly accurate reflection of the results. Nearly 29.4 million people, or 66.3% of eligible voters, had cast their ballots as of 6 p.m. (0900 GMT), according to the National Election Commission, including 14 million who had voted before election day.
It marked the highest ever turnout for a parliamentary election at this point, though the numbers were down from the 2022 presidential vote that narrowly brought Yoon to power. The exit polls indicated that the DP-led opposition, which already dominates the legislature, would increase its majority but fall short of securing a super majority of 200 seats, which would have stripped Yoon of his veto power.
But their expected landslide victory could hamper Yoon's policy efforts to boost the economy, improve fiscal health and lift record low birthrates, as well as to bolster trilateral security cooperation with the United States and Japan. A liberal splinter party led by former justice minister Cho Kuk, which has emerged as a dark horse, was projected in the polls to win up to 15 seats and to become a third-party force that could influence control of the assembly.
Opposition leaders have accused Yoon and the PPP of mismanaging the economy and failing to rein in inflation, with Cho vowing to make Yoon a ""dead duck"" president by gaining sufficient seats. PPP chief Han Dong-hoon, who had said an opposition majority would create a crisis for the country, said the exit polls were ""disappointing"" but said he is awaiting final results, without elaborating.
Democratic Party head Lee Jae-myung has yet to comment on the polls. Cho said the numbers highlighted voters' desire to hold Yoon's administration accountable for what he called a ""prosecutor dictatorship,"" referring to Yoon's previous role as prosecutor general.
Cho pledged to push for a bill to appoint a special counsel to look into alleged irregularities involving PPP chief Han's family. Han has previously dismissed such allegations.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,57,Exit polls suggest a big win by South Korea’s liberal opposition parties in parliamentary election,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s liberal opposition parties were expected to win a landslide victory in Wednesday’s parliamentary election , initial exit polls suggested, a result that if confirmed would make conservative President Yoon Suk Ye
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s liberal opposition parties were expected to win a landslide victory in Wednesday’s parliamentary election, initial exit polls suggested, a result that if confirmed would make conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol a lame duck for his remaining three years in office.
The joint exit polls by South Korea’s three major TV stations – KBS, MBC and SBS – showed the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party were forecast to win combined 178-197 seats in the 300-member National Assembly. They expected anothernew liberal opposition party to win 12-14 seats.
The polls suggested the ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to win 85-105 seats.
Wednesday's election was widely seen as a mid-term confidence vote on President Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term. He has been grappling with low approval ratings and a liberal opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his major policy platforms.
Regardless of the results, Yoon will stay in power, but if his party fails to regain a parliamentary majority it could set back Yoon’s agenda and further intensify conservative-liberal fighting.
“What would matter to the People Power Party is whether it can become the biggest party or the second biggest party,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “If his party loses the election, Yoon will find it difficult to move forward even a single step on state affairs.”
Of the 300 seats, 254 will be elected through direct votes in local districts, and the other 46 to the parties according to their proportion of the vote. Election observers say candidates in about 50 to 55 local districts are in neck-and-neck races.
In the months ahead of the election, the conservatives supporting Yoon and their liberal rivals exchanged toxic rhetoric and mudslinging. The conservative-liberal division deepened during the 2022 presidential election, during which Yoon and his main rival Lee Jae-myung spent months demonizing each other. Yoon eventually beat Lee by the narrowest margin ever for a Korean presidential candidate.
Lee, now the chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, is a harsh critic of Yoon’s policies and is eying another presidential bid. He faces an array of corruption investigations that he argues are politically motivated and pushed by by Yoon’s government.
There was a brief soul-searching about South Korea’s divisive politics after Lee was stabbed in the neck in January by a man who, according to police, tried to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president. But as the parliamentary election approached, the rival parties began churning out abusive rhetoric and crude insults against each other.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon called Lee “a criminal” and labeled his past comments as “trash.” Lee’s party spokesperson described Han’s mouth as a “trash bin.” Han accused Lee of using a sexist remark against a female ruling party candidate.
During one of his final campaign events on Tuesday, Han argued that giving too many seats to Lee’s Democratic Party will throw South Korea into political turmoil. “Tomorrow’s 12 hours will determine whether the Republic of Korea will plunge into shocking chaos and despair or overcome a crisis,” Han said, using South Korea’s official name.
Speaking ahead of his corruption trial at a Seoul court, Lee urged voters to punish the Yoon government, which he said has used prosecutors to suppress opponents. “I earnestly ask you to hand out your judgement on a government that betrays and goes against the people,” Lee said.
Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at Kyung Hee University, predicted that the opposition parties could win a combined 150-180 seats.
“That would cause a political deadlock for the Republic of Korea for the next three years, as both the ruling and opposition parties can’t pursue things unilaterally and won’t likely make terms with each other,” Chung said.
Earlier this year, Yoon saw rising approval ratings over his strong push to drastically increase the number of medical students despite vehement protests by incumbent doctors. Yoon has said he aims to create more doctors to brace for the country’s rapidly aging population, but thousands of young doctors have gone on strike, saying that schools can’t handle an abrupt increase in students.
The doctors’ walkouts eventually left Yoon facing growing calls to find a compromise, with patients and others experiencing delays of surgeries and other inconveniences. Yoon’s ruling party is also struggling with rising prices of agricultural products and other goods and criticism of Yoon’s personnel management style.
“President Yoon has said a priority would be given to stabilizing prices and livelihoods, but they weren’t stabilized, so I think that will be a big negative for the Yoon government during the election,” Kim Daye, a 32-year-old Seoul resident, said.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,63,South Korea opposition set for landslide in parliamentary election,"SEOUL - South Korea’s opposition was heading towards a landslide victory on April 10 in parliamentary elections, exit polls indicated, in a major blow to President Yoon Suk-yeol.
The outcome if confirmed will at the very least leave Mr Yoon as a lame duck for the three remaining years of his term in office, and could even open the way for his impeachment.
The Democratic Party (DP) of Lee Jae-myung – survivor of a January knife attack and myriad scandals – and its satellites are forecast to win as many as 197 seats, up from 156 in the last Parliament.
Mr Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) and its partner were projected to be trailing on between 85 and 99 seats, down from 114, the exit polls conducted by three major broadcasters indicated.
All opposition parties combined may even have secured a super-majority of 200 in the 300-seat Parliament, which could in theory allow them to attempt to remove Mr Yoon from office before his term ends in 2027.
That includes new party Rebuilding Korea, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk, which capitalised on discontent with the two main parties to pick up a projected 12 to 14 seats.
“The people have won, the will to judge Yoon Suk-yeol is very clear,” Cho said after the vote, local media reported.
On the campaign trail, he vowed to make Mr Yoon “first a lame duck, then a dead duck”.
“The figures today show the strong anger of people at Yoon for his two-year governance,” political analyst Yum Seung-yul told AFP.
“What if he won’t change even with this stunning election outcome? I think there will be even more public anger and that worries me.”
Mr Yoon beat Lee in South Korea’s closest-ever presidential election in 2022, and has taken a tough line with the nuclear-armed North Korea while improving ties with Washington and former colonial occupier Japan.
But Lee, while fending off a slew of graft probes he says are politically motivated, has secured revenge with the election result, following a bruising and polarising campaign.
“I’ll watch the people’s choice with a humble heart,” Lee said after the vote, local media reported.
From the start of his presidency, Mr Yoon has been unpopular, with ratings hitting the low 30s, and the PPP’s lack of control of the National Assembly has stymied his socially conservative legislative agenda.
This includes planned healthcare reforms – that are backed by voters but have sparked a crippling strike by doctors – and a pledge to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality.
PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said that “exit polls are disappointing... We will watch the vote count”, the Yonhap News Agency reported.
On Mr Yoon’s side were shifting demographics, with voters aged 60 and older now outnumbering those in both their 20s and 30s in a country with the world’s lowest birth rate.
Younger Koreans have been put off politics by a political class dominated by older men who ignore their concerns.
Many say this was underlined by the horrific 2022 Halloween crowd crush in Seoul that killed more than 150, mostly young people.
The younger generation is also struggling economically, with cut-throat competition in education, fewer job opportunities and sky-high housing costs.
“There is definitely less interest in this election among the people around me than last time. I think it is because they feel rather disappointed,” business owner Kim Yong-ho, 24, said outside a polling station in Seoul’s Gwangjin district.
The tone of the campaigning has also put many voters off, lacking in substantive policy debate and marked instead by shrill calls to “imprison” Lee or “punish” Mr Yoon.
“I am truly ashamed of our country’s politics and government,” Ms Kim Do-kyung, 47, an activist for migrant women and their children, told AFP.
This has been accompanied by hate speech and disinformation online that experts worry could lead to more attacks like the one on Lee in January and another weeks later.
The DP favours a less hawkish approach towards Pyongyang, and Lee has made a number of pro-China remarks.
One doctored video showed him bowing to a statue of Mao Zedong.
It has also latched onto a gaffe by Mr Yoon in March about the “reasonable” cost of green onions, a staple in Korean cooking that has soared in price.
The humble vegetable became a popular prop at DP rallies, and the election commission even banned voters from bringing them to polling stations.
Mr Jeremiah Shim, 40, a pastor, said people in his congregation are finding it harder to get by because of rising food prices.
“I support (Lee). His history and life journey are very impressive. Many people think he can change our future,” Mr Shim told AFP at a DP rally.

Can Opposition bloc use the name INDIA? Delhi High Court’s verdict
The Delhi High Court will decide today if the Opposition’s INDIA bloc can use the acronym. Earlier, the court had asked the respondents, including the opposition parties and the Centre to file their replies within a week.
The Election Commission of India, in response to the petition, had informed the Delhi High Court that it lacks the authority to regulate political alliances.
The ECI has stated that while it is vested with the authority to register associations or bodies of individuals as political parties under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, political alliances are not recognised as regulated entities under the Act or the Constitution.
The plea sought directions from the court to the central government and the Election Commission of India (ECI) to take necessary action against the political parties for using the acronym INDIA. It stated that the acronym INDIA is being used with malicious intent, which will only act as a factor to diminish the goodwill of the country. The petitioner said the word “India is an essential part and essence of the national emblem, and it cannot be used for any professional, commercial, or political purposes.

South Korea elections
South Koreans go to the polls today to select a new 300-member National Assembly. The parliamentary elections are widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Yoon won the presidential election in March 2022 by a razor-thin margin, and three months later, his People Power Party won the most big-city mayor and provincial governor races.
According to a New York Times report, voting will begin at 6 am local time, and, unless there’s an extremely tight race, it should be clear by early the next day which party has won.

The polls suggested the ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to win 85-105 seats.
Wednesday’s election was widely seen as a mid-term confidence vote on President Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term.

Regardless of the results, Mr Yoon will stay in power, but if his party fails to regain a parliamentary majority it could set back his agenda and further intensify conservative-liberal fighting.
“What would matter to the People Power Party is whether it can become the biggest party or the second biggest party,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “If his party loses the election, Yoon will find it difficult to move forward even a single step on state affairs.”
Of the 300 seats, 254 will be elected through direct votes in local districts, and the other 46 to the parties according to their proportion of the vote.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,67,Filipinas remain winless this year after losses in Korea,"Victory eluded the Philippine women’s football team anew as the Filipinas dropped a total of two friendly matches against South Korea in Incheon.
But coach Mark Torcaso believes the effort the Filipinas put up in 3-0 and 2-1 defeats are necessary steps to what he has always stressed as bridging the gap with some of Asia’s top teams.

“To come in and give Korea very, very tough two games, I’m actually delighted,” said Torcaso. “Even with some key players missing, we were able to fight hard.”
The Filipinas remained without a win in this calendar year, having lost all five matches including February’s Pinatar Cup in Spain against European opposition.Friday saw the Filipinas flirt at battling a scoreless draw until South Korea found ways late in the second half to come away with a 3-0 win.
On Monday, the Philippines conceded twice in the first half, but had a chance to snatch a draw after defender Angie Beard struck a free kick in the 74th minute.
Beard’s goal, which she fired over a wall of South Korean defenders from at least 30 yards, was the first time the Philippines scored in 2024.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,68,Korean teen fires flawless 66 for men’s lead; Superal shares ladies’ pace,"South Korea’s Tae Soo-kim, playing on a special exemption in the Philippine Golf Tour season, had everything going for him on Tuesday, shooting a flawless six-under-par 66 to take a one-shot lead over Dino Villanueva in the ICTSI Caliraya Springs Championship, even as Princess Superal underscored her tag as the player to watch in the ladies side by sharing the opening round lead.
The 19-year-old Kim, who hardly contended in the circuit’s first two legs in Davao last month, assembled nines of 33-33 after a brilliant display of shotmaking, surprising himself with the solo lead in the process. “I didn’t expect this (to lead),” Kim said. “I struggled to [finish at par] during the practice round. I just hit a lot of fairways with my solid driving.”

Villanueva also had six birdies like Kim but dropped his only shot on the par-5 12th, even as Angelo Que Sean Ramos and Guido van der Valk returned 69s to be just three shots off, with defending champion Antonio Lascuña shooting a lukewarm 72.
Tougher this year
Que, the former Philippine Open champion and multileg winner on the Asian Tour, said that the course played a lot tougher compared to last year, when Lascuña won with an 18-under total.
“The greens are firm, the pins are tough and the wind was blowing,” said Que, who climbed into that three-way tie with a closing birdie. “So, it’s really hard when you have those combinations.”
Superal, meanwhile, drained a 6-footer for birdie on No. 18 to join Pamela Mariano at the top of the 54-hole ladies championship, as she made it known that she will be using this tournament while on break from her commitments in Japan to win.
Two of Superal’s three birdies came in the back nine of a 37-34 effort as she totally outshone another returning star in defending champion Pauline del Rosario in the opening round.
Del Rosario, who is also on break from the Epson Tour in the United States, fired a 73 marred by a double bogey 7 at the sixth. She went birdie-less coming home to be two shots back like Chanelle Avaricio and Mafy Singson.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,70,US launches another spy into orbit - here's what we know about the hundreds of satellites watching us,"The US launched a reconnaissance satellite into orbit on Tuesday, the second reconnaissance satellite to go up in as many days.
On Monday, South Korea sent its second into space, after the first went up in December. The country has a contract with SpaceX to send up three more reconnaissance satellites by 2025.
North Korea sent up its own in November and at the end of March, a North Korean official said the nation expects to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year.
Leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024.
So what are all those satellites doing up there?
Gaining military advantages
The National Reconnaissance Office in the US says it ""uses satellites and other space-based capabilities to secure and expand America's intelligence advantage"".
""Some of the earliest satellites were reconnaissance satellites,"" Professor Erik Gartzke, the director of the Center for Peace and Security Studies at the University of California, told Sky News.
""During the Cold War, they allowed the Soviets and the United States to make arms control agreements that were enforceable because each side could see if the other side was cheating.

""Largely because of this technology, it became possible to have some of the first and most effective arms control agreements in world history.""
The UK has its own network of 'Beyond Line of Sight communications' called Skynet.
They are make sure the UK armed forces ""get the right information at the right time,"" according to Airbus, who runs the network.
These reconnaissance satellites are also being used to fight crime.
In 2021, Colombia's notorious drug lord Otoniel was captured using satellite imagery analysed by experts from the UK, US and elsewhere.
North and South Korea have been more explicit about what their satellites are for.

Disputed pictures of the Pentagon
In November, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said the country's satellites would ""deter, control and manage the dangerous and aggressive moves of hostile forces"", according to state media.
When the country's first satellite successfully went into orbit, North Korea claimed it was transmitting imagery of key sites in the US and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon.
But it hasn't released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
Whether the country even had control of the satellite was disputed until researchers verified signs from the satellite in February.

Bolstering the 'kill chain'
Until December 2023, South Korea had no spy satellites of its own and was reliant on the US to monitor moves by North Korea.
With two South Korean satellites now in orbit, the military says its powers have been improved.
""Our military has acquired an additional independent surveillance ability and further bolstered our 'kill chain' capability,"" a defence ministry spokesperson told reporters.
The 'kill chain' capability refers to the ability to preemptively fire missiles.
But Professor Gartzke says these satellites could decrease military conflict.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,71,Visits from Japanese and Filipino leaders highlight Biden’s efforts to blunt China’s aggression,"Washington CNN —
President Joe Biden will host the first-ever leaders’ summit between the US, Japan and the Philippines this week, the latest attempt to draw Pacific allies and partners closer as the region grapples with China’s aggression and nuclear provocations from North Korea.
It comes as the president has sought to keep his eye on the strategy laid out early in the administration even as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza rose to the forefront of global attention.
Biden’s week also includes an official visit for Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, reinforcing his commitment to cultivating partnerships in the Indo-Pacific in the face of China’s rising economic and military power.
“Since day one, President Biden has remained personally focused on reaffirming and reinvigorating our alliances around the world, and nowhere has this strategy paid off more than in the Indo-Pacific,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN in a statement. “We firmly believe that investing in alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific benefits the American people, makes us safer, and more competitive on the world stage.”
Starting Tuesday evening, the president and first lady Dr. Jill Biden welcome Kishida and his wife Kishida Yuko to the White House. The official visit kicks off in earnest on Wednesday with the full pomp and circumstance of a South Lawn arrival ceremony, bilateral meeting, joint news conference and lavish state dinner.
It will mark the fifth official state visit of the Biden White House and the fourth dedicated to a key Indo-Pacific ally with three previous visits honoring Australia, India and South Korea.
The two men are expected to announce a major update to their military alliance and lay out greater defense industrial cooperation, a senior administration official said. They’re expected to hail new steps on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity work and deepening semiconductor production.
The leaders are also expected to detail space collaboration at a time when Japan has signaled interest in landing its first astronaut on the moon and to lay out ways to increase people-to-people ties amid lagging student exchanges between the two countries in recent years.
But even as the US and Japan are bolstering their cooperation across a range of sectors, the two countries have seen a recent difference on an economic front with the president opposing Japan’s efforts to purchase US Steel, an issue that could arise in discussions.
The historic leaders summit on Thursday between Biden, Kishida and Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos is expected to produce announcements relating to infrastructure, energy security, digital connectivity and maritime security. The three leaders will hold private discussions on the South China Sea, where the Philippines is facing “extraordinary pressure,” the senior official said, as Manila grapples with Beijing’s aggression in the contested waters.
“With the official visit of Prime Minister Kishida, the visit of President Marcos, and the historic trilateral leaders’ summit, we will show that our key alliances have reached heights that have never before been achieved and are ones that we believe we can sustain in the years ahead,” Sullivan said.
Forging ties on military, technology, infrastructure
The shared goal of keeping autocratic power at bay – while protecting their prowess in advanced technology – is expected to be a major theme of the visit.
Kishida, who is also set to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday, has already shown keen interest in the critical importance of the semiconductor industry, meeting with executives on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in November and coordinating export controls with Washington and other allies.
“There’s a loose collaboration on the supply chains,” said John Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. “But there’s really, in the last couple years, been a stepped-up effort on export controls.”
Biden is expected to encourage Kishida to place more restrictions on the export of high-tech chips to thwart China’s military and economic capabilities. But US officials acknowledge Kishida’s preference has been to do so only in lockstep with the Netherlands, South Korea and Taiwan, to avoid direct confrontation with Beijing.
Meanwhile, Japan has recently loosened restrictions on the export of military technology – paving the way for deeper collaboration with like-minded allies.
“Both countries over the last two years have gone through dramatic changes in their policies. And this is literally the end of one kind of era,” Rahm Emanuel, the US ambassador to Japan, told CNN in an interview. The next three decades, he said, will be defined by “alliance protection.”
At Thursday’s summit of the three leaders, the White House is expected to bolster the Filipino military’s capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the leadup to the G20. Senior administration officials tell CNN the leaders will announce the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between Philippines’s Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that’s meant to send a clear message to Beijing.
In the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and Philippines - along with Australia - conducted maritime military exercises near Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged “harassment” by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.
Crafting an alliance-forward strategy
The meetings come as the region is grappling with the uncertainty of China’s aggressive posture toward Taiwan and the South China Sea along with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its burgeoning relationship with Russia – concerns that have drawn regional allies closer to the US.
Japan has been at the center of Biden’s alliance building in the Indo-Pacific as officials have seen a willing partner in Kishida, who has significantly shifted the country’s defense posture in recent years and provided ongoing support to Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kishida has committed to increasing defense spending by 2% of GDP by 2037 and acquired American Tomahawk missiles to increase its counterstrike capabilities.
Before entering the White House, the president and Sullivan tasked the transition team to tap into alliances and partnerships where they saw “extraordinary potential if only the United States turned back to it and reembraced it,” one senior administration official said.
“What we did was put together a strategy that was designed to help a wide range of allies and partners see pieces of themselves and their own objectives in our Indo-pacific strategy,” the official said.
One directive from Sullivan to his team was to think creatively about new groupings to push that Indo-Pacific strategy forward. During that transition period, Sullivan and senior advisers zeroed-in on plans to elevate the Quad partnership between the US, Japan, Australia and India to the leader level and in the opening weeks of the administration ramped up efforts to make that a reality. The first virtual meeting with the four leaders took place in March 2021 with subsequent in-person summits in the years that followed.
The president also had his eye on strengthening the trilateral relationship between the US, Japan and South Korea, an effort the official described as a “slower boil” following decades of mistrust and tension between Tokyo and Seoul.
To move that along, the president hosted Japan’s then-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and South Korea’s then-President Moon Jae-in for his very first foreign leader meetings at the White House and visited the countries back-to-back in 2022. In their separate meetings, the president made clear the importance of the trilateral relationship and offered assurances the US stood ready to help the two countries work on their relationship, officials said.
Under the leadership of Kishida and President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japan and South Korea took significant steps to ease their tensions in the years that followed, culminating with an historic Camp David summit where Biden praised the ushering in of a “new era of cooperation” between the three countries.
At the same time, the administration has forged ahead with a new security partnership with the United Kingdom and Australia known as AUKUS. Ahead of Kishida’s visit to the White House, defense chiefs with the AUKUS countries announced they would consider working with Japan on “advanced capabilities” projects, signaling a potential strengthening of the alliance.
Biden and his team also have sought to draw in smaller regional neighbors concerned about China’s military and economic aggression. He’s deepened military ties with the Philippines under Marcos after the previous leader Rodrigo Duterte distanced the country from Washington and moved to align with Beijing more closely. Sullivan in part laid the groundwork for this week’s historic summit when he traveled to Japan for the first meeting between national security advisers for the US, Japan and the Philippines in June.
Vietnam last year elevated its ties with the US to a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” putting it among the country’s highest tier of partners, including China. The White House has ramped up engagement with Pacific Island nations and sought to boost economic ties with regional partners through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, including efforts to make supply chains more resilient, promote clean energy, combat corruption, and trade, though a formal trade deal has proved elusive.
Biden and his team have taken steps to try to institutionalize the defense, security and economic advancements made with allies to ensure they are a “feature of the system and not just a bright idea of this particular team,” the official said.
It comes as partners are keenly aware leadership in Washington could change next year as Biden is engaged in a close contest against his predecessor former President Donald Trump, who could reshape US policy toward the region once again.
“Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming presidential election in the United States, because of this more complicated international situation, the Japan-U.S. alliance grows in importance even more,” Kishida said in an interview with PBS last week. “And I believe this is a notion shared as a common recognition within the U.S., going beyond party lines, in a bipartisan way.”
But Biden continues looking for other ways to deepen the alliances, including the potential for further meetings with the Quad countries and with the leaders of South Korea and Japan, as his first term is winding down and with an eye on the future.
“The fundamental question that was at issue in our Indo Pacific strategy and is at issue in the region is what the shape and character of the international order is going to look like a few decades hence,” the official said. “It is arguably the clearest example of the president and his top foreign policy leadership, having a clear vision for a foreign policy that would be good for everyday Americans and executing on it in a seamless and a coordinated fashion in ways that yield results.”",2024-04-09 16:06:12,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network,71,president joe host summit u japan

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)
SEOUL – South Koreans vote Wednesday in a hotly contested parliamentary election that's largely seen as a referendum on conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol and a possible sign of a deepening domestic divide.
Regardless of the results, Yoon will stay in power and his major foreign policy agenda will likely continue. But a failure by his governing People Power Party to restore a parliamentary majority could make him a lame duck for the remaining three years of his single five-year term, experts say.
Recommended Videos
Since taking office in 2022, Yoon, a former top prosecutor, has been grappling with low approval ratings and a liberal opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his major policy platforms.
Pre-election surveys indicate that the liberal opposition parties will likely maintain a dominant position in the single-chamber, 300-member National Assembly. But many observers say it's still too early to determine who will win the election because many electorates are being closely fought and many moderate voters will make last-minute choices.
""What would matter to the People Power Party is whether it can become the biggest party or the second biggest party,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “If his party loses the elections, Yoon will find it difficult to move forward even a single step on state affairs.”
Of the 300 seats, 254 are to be elected through direct votes in local districts and the other 46 allotted by the proportion of the votes cast for the parties. Election observers say candidates in about 50 to 55 local districts are in neck-and-neck races.
Polling stations will open at 6 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. South Korea has 44 million eligible voters, and about 31% of them, or nearly 14 million people, have already cast ballots during two-day early voting last week. It was the highest turnout of its kind in the history of South Korean parliamentary elections, according to the National Election Commission.
South Korea’s toxic conservative-liberal division deepened during the 2022 presidential election, during which Yoon and his main liberal rival Lee Jae-myung spent months demonizing each other. Yoon eventually beat Lee by the narrowest margin in the country’s presidential race.
Lee, now the chairman of the opposition Democratic Party, is a harsh critic of Yoon's major policies and is eying another presidential bid. He faces an array of corruption investigations that he argues were politically motivated by Yoon's government.
There was a brief soul-searching about South Korea’s divisive politics after Lee was stabbed in the neck in January by a man who, according to police, tried to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president. But as the parliamentary election approached, the rival parties began churning out abusive rhetoric and crude insults against each other.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon called Lee “a criminal” and labeled his past comments as “trash."" Lee's party spokesperson described Han's mouth as a “trash bin.” Han accused Lee of using a sexist remark against a female ruling party candidate.
During one of his final campaign events on Tuesday, Han argued that giving too many seats to Lee's Democratic Party will throw South Korea into political turmoil. “Tomorrow's 12 hours will determine whether the Republic of Korea will plunge into shocking chaos and despair or overcome a crisis,” Han said, using South Korea's official name.
Speaking ahead of his corruption trial at a Seoul court, Lee urged voters to punish the Yoon government, which he said has used prosecutors to suppress opponents. “I earnestly ask you to hand out your judgement on a government that betrays and goes against the people,” Lee said.
Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at Kyung Hee University, predicted that the opposition parties could win a combined 150-180 seats.
“That would cause a political deadlock for the Republic of Korea for the next three years, as both the ruling and opposition parties can't pursue things unilaterally and won't likely make terms with each other,” Chung said.
Earlier this year, Yoon saw rising approval ratings over his strong push to drastically increase the number of medical students despite vehement protests by incumbent doctors. Yoon has said he aims to create more doctors to brace for the country's rapidly aging population, but thousands of young doctors have gone on strike, saying that schools can't handle an abrupt increase in students.
The doctors' walkouts eventually left Yoon facing growing calls to find a compromise, with patients and others experiencing delays of surgeries and other inconveniences. Yoon's ruling party is also struggling with rising prices of agricultural products and other goods and criticism of Yoon's personnel management style.
""President Yoon has said a priority would be given to stabilizing prices and livelihoods, but they weren’t stabilized, so I think that will be a big negative for the Yoon government during the elections,” Kim Daye, a 32-year-old Seoul resident, said.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,73,US Ally Launches Spy Satellite Against North Korea,"South Korea on Sunday successfully put its sophomore spy satellite into orbit to help it keep an eye on the North.
The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket bearing the satellite and 10 other spacecraft lifted off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center at 7:16 a.m. local time. It entered orbit about 45 minutes later and began communicating with a ground station by 10:57 a.m., according to South Korea's defense ministry.
South Korea sent up its first homemade spy satellite on December 1, less than two weeks after the North successfully launched its own spy satellite in its third attempt.
A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 18, 2024. On April 7, a Falcon 9 carried South Korea's second spy satellite into orbit.

Last month, local media cited sources familiar with the matter as saying that the South was already receiving ""good"" resolution images of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, including the headquarters of the one-party state's Workers' Party of Korea, and the office of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.
However, sources said the images still required heavy editing and that higher resolution ones are expected starting this month, with the satellite expected to begin its ""full reconnaissance mission"" this summer.
The satellite sent up Sunday boasts synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors that use microwaves to collect data at night and in all weather conditions. The next three surveillance satellites South Korea plans to launch by next year will also be equipped with SAR sensors.
Newsweek reached out to the North Korean embassy in Beijing and the South Korean embassy in Washington, D.C, via written requests for comment.
Pyongyang may also be preparing for its next launch, South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Col. Lee Sung-jun told reported late last month amid signs of new activity at the North's Sohae Satellite Launching Station.
Last week, North Korean state media said the Kim regime would send ""several"" more satellites into space by the end of 2024, putting it on track to become a ""space power.""
Washington condemned the launch of Pyonyang's first spy satellite, Malligyong-1, as a breach of the United Nations Security Council resolutions to block dual-use technology that could advance North Korea's ballistic missile program.

North Korea's foreign ministry said the satellite program was necessary for national defense and ""improving the security environment of the Korean Peninsula.""
South Korea responded by suspending part of a landmark 2018 military agreement with the North and resuming patrols along the demarcation line separating the uneasy neighbors. The North then quit the pact entirely and announced it would deploy its own forces to the area.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,74,Surging fruit and vegetable prices a hot issue in South Korea’s legislative election,"SEOUL - Apples and green onions have been stirring up a storm before South Koreans head to the polls on April 10.
Apart from controversies such as a scandal over a Dior handbag gifted to First Lady Kim Keon-hee and an ongoing doctors’ strike, surging food inflation amid economic stagnation has put the ruling government in a precarious position ahead of the race for seats in the National Assembly.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and his ruling People’s Power Party (PPP) are hoping to win back control of the legislature from the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DP).
But Mr Yoon is in a bit of a pickle after a visit to a supermarket on March 18, where he picked up a bunch of green onions priced at 875 won (87 Singapore cents) per kg and declared the price “reasonable”.
This was actually a special promotional price and not a reflection of the prevailing market price of green onions, which was as high as 4,000 won per kg then.
The backlash was instant. Opposition politicians gleefully carried bunches of green onions – a staple of Korean cuisine – and ridiculed the President for being out of touch with the masses.
Early voters who went to the polls on the weekend of April 6 and 7 brought along bunches of onions, with some even holding up paper bags which held green onions and had the word “Dior” scrawled on them. The election authorities have since banned the vegetable from polling stations, citing concerns of “election interference”.
South Korea has an early voting system, introduced in 2014, which allows voters to cast their ballots earlier on predetermined dates, in order to encourage higher voter turnout.
Of some 44.3 million eligible voters, 31.3 per cent have already cast their ballots through the early voting system in a record high turnout at this stage of the election. The remaining voters will submit their votes on April 10.
Inflation has emerged as a hot electoral issue.
Consumer prices in South Korea rose by 3.1 per cent in March from a year earlier, official statistics show, with food prices as a whole rising by 6.7 per cent.
Fruit prices, in particular, have shot through the roof – the price of apples hit an all-time high of 9,170 won per kg in March, more than double the 4,106 won per kg just a year ago. This led local media to dub it an “appflation” (combination of apple and inflation) crisis.
Voters, like Madam Kim Soo-young, are more upset with President Yoon’s comment than just the food inflation.
The 50-year-old housekeeper recalled that the price of green onions had risen even higher to peak at nearly 7,000 won a kg in 2021 when Mr Moon Jae-in was president, driving people to grow onions at home and swop cultivation tips on the internet.
But the recent incident showed that President Yoon was uninterested in people’s livelihoods, she said, which is leading her, a swing voter, to cast her vote for the new party Rebuilding Korea Party set up by Mr Yoon’s old foe Cho Kuk.
“Most people can’t buy green onions for 875 won anywhere. Even the apples that we commonly eat have become so expensive. It is not so much a matter of price – what makes people like us angry is that the President does not appear to understand what we are going through.”",2024-04-09 13:32:00,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times,74,green stirring storm south head 10apart scandal handbag gifted first lady kim ongoing strike surging food inflation amid economic stagnation put ruling government precarious position ahead race national president ruling power party win back control legislature main opposition democratic party korea bit pickle visit supermarket march 18 picked bunch green priced 875 87 per declared price actually special promotional price reflection market price green high 4000 per backlash instant opposition gleefully carried green staple cuisine president touch went weekend 6 7 brought along even holding paper green word election since vegetable polling election korea early voting system 2014 cast order encourage higher voter 443 million eligible 313 per cent already cast early voting system record high turnout stage election submit 10inflation hot electoral south korea rose 31 per cent march year official statistic show food whole rising 67 per particular shot roof price hit high 9170 per march double 4106 per year ago led local medium dub combination apple inflation like madam kim upset president comment food 50yearold housekeeper price green risen even higher peak nearly 7000 2021 moon president driving people grow home cultivation recent incident president uninterested said leading swing voter cast vote new party korea party set old foe cho people cant buy green 875 anywhere even commonly eat become expensive much matter price people like u angry president appear understand going surging fruit vegetable hot issue south legislative election
TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,76,Explained: The factors driving South Koreans to vote for parliament this week,"Voters in South Korea are driven by a number of problems as they head to the polls on Wednesday to choose a new 300-member parliament.

Soaring green onion prices. Striking doctors. A politician’s allegedly sexist jab at a woman candidate. This is what is on top of the minds of voters in South Korea, as they head to the polls on Wednesday to choose a new 300-member parliament.
The most significant election issues for many are public livelihoods and other domestic concerns and not traditional subjects like North Korean nuclear threats and US security commitment for South Korea.
“I feel drawn to someone who talks about things that can be truly helpful to our neighbourhoods,” said Kim Yun-ah, a 45-year-old Seoul officer worker. “I often don’t know when North Korea test-fired missiles.”

Up to 30 to 40 per cent of South Korea’s 44 million voters, according to experts, are politically neutral, and their votes could have an impact on the outcome of the election.
Here’s a look at some of the burning issues in the elections:
Domestic and livelihood issues
Because of the enormous differences between conservative and liberal candidates in South Korea, many voters have probably already decided who to support based more on party affiliation than on the policies of the candidates running in their districts.
However, Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, notes that the high polarisation has also increased moderates who are tired of partisanship and prefer to focus on matters that directly impact them, such as jobs, taxes, and pricing.
Choi estimated that roughly 30 per cent of South Koreans consider themselves conservatives, another 30 per cent liberals and the remaining 40 per cent moderates. According to some experts, 30 per cent of people identify as moderates.

“In a nutshell, even if conservatives and liberals intensely bicker over political issues, that won’t influence election results much,” Choi said. “The fate of an election is rather determined by the moderates who silently monitor livelihood issues and decide who to vote for.”
Supporters listen to the speech of the ruling People Power Party’s leader Han Dong-hoon during a campaign rally for the upcoming parliamentary election in Goyang, South Korea. AP
Some observers say liberal parties could retain their parliamentary majority, making conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol — whose single five-year term ends in 2027 — an early lame duck. But others note many moderates are still undecided.

Regardless of the outcome, Yoon’s major foreign policy agendas would remain unchanged, such as boosting security cooperation with the US and Japan and taking a tough line on North Korea’s nuclear programme, experts say.
Soaring prices of green onions
Yoon got more than he bargained for when he visited a Seoul grocery mall last month to promote government efforts to tame food prices but ended up inviting criticism by talking about the price of green onions.

Looking at a bundle of green onions with a price tag of 875 won ($0.65) — a temporary discount price thanks to a government subsidy — Yoon said, “I’ve been to lots of markets, and I would say 875 won is a reasonable price.”
Green onions have been selling for some of the highest retail prices in recent years, ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 won ($2.2 to $2.9) on average.

Candidates from the main liberal opposition Democratic Party carried green onions to election rallies and accused Yoon of underestimating food prices and being out of touch with reality. Yoon’s casual remark set off a mini-crisis for his ruling People Power Party.
It goes beyond green onions.
Compared to the same month last year, the price of agricultural items climbed by more than 20 per cent in March. Apple prices jumped by about 90 per cent in a single year, the biggest increase since 1980.
People pass by posters of candidates running for the upcoming parliamentary election in Seoul, South Korea. AP
Kim Tae-hyung, 55, said he’s almost decided to vote for a liberal opposition candidate in his constituency because he believes the Yoon government hasn’t done well on the economy.
But he said Yoon doesn’t deserve criticism over his green onion remarks. “Even if he doesn’t know the price of green onions, I don’t think it matters much as I also didn’t know about it.”
Doctors’ strikes
Yoon’s party faces additional challenges due to the thousands of doctors going on weeks-long strikes.
The doctors, who are all residents and medical interns, are demonstrating against Yoon’s proposal to raise the annual cap on medical school admissions by two thirds. They say universities can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that it would undermine the country’s medical services. Critics claim that if there are more doctors, they will worry about their salary.
Yoon’s plan initially gave him a boost in approval ratings but he now faces growing calls for a compromise as the strikes have caused numerous cancellations in surgeries and other inconveniences for patients.
Toxic rhetoric
Rival political groups have been using extremely offensive and abusive rhetoric towards one another, driven by their contempt for the other side.
When Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party chairman, criticised senior ruling party candidate Na Kyung-won over her alleged pro-Japanese views, he called her “nabe,” a combination of letters of her name and that of late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon called Lee’s comments “extreme misogyny.”
Nabe in Japanese means pot, whose Korean translation is “naembi,” which can be used as a derogatory slang term to refer to a woman with many sex partners. Last month, supporters of Na’s liberal rival candidate reportedly spread on social media a poster with a message saying “naembi tastes best when it’s trampled on.”
Han labelled Lee’s past comments as “trash,” drawing rebukes from Lee’s party spokesperson, who described “Han’s mouth” as “trash bin.”
Also roiling the South Korean election race is former liberal justice minister Cho Kuk, whose newly launched small party is forecast by surveys to win 10-15 seats. Cho was once a rising political star during the government of Yoon’s liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, until he faced a slew of scandals that hurt his reformist image and sharply split the nation.
Han called Cho “a shameless petty criminal.” Cho said Han, Yoon and Yoon’s wife and first lady Kim Keon Hee were “representative people of a criminal group.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,77,Filipinas end goal drought but lose anew in South Korea friendly,"MANILA, Philippines–Angie Beard broke the Philippine women’s football team’s goal drought with a sensational free kick in the second half that served as a silver lining in the 2-1 international friendly loss to South Korea on Monday in Icheon.
Beard struck in the 74th minute, kicking it over a wall of defenders from about 30 yards that enabled the Filipinas to cut the deficit after conceding twice in the first half of the contest held at Icheon Sports Complex.

The Filipinas, however, couldn’t add to Beard’s goal and dropped another match against their fellow participant in last year’s Fifa Women’s World Cup.
Coach Mark Torcaso’s side lost 3-0 in the first of two friendlies between the two nations last Friday.
But Torcaso is hoping that significant progress was made in the two games, as the Filipinas now begin the process of finding more friendlies in succeeding windows with no major tournaments slated for the rest of the year.
South Korea got the lead less than a minute into the second meeting on a goal from Choo Hyo-joo before Choe Yu-ri added a second for the hosts in the 33rd.
Torcaso made some changes in the starting 11, with Sarina Bolden not even in uniform for the Filipinas and captain Tahnai Annis being placed on the bench.
Chandler McDaniel and Katrina Guillou replaced both players to join Quinley Quezada, Rhea Chan, Sofia Harrison, Beard, Carleigh Frilles, Sara Eggesvik, Jessika Cowart, Olivia McDaniel and Hali Long, who wore the captain’s armband.

BEIJING – A top Chinese leader will lead a delegation to North Korea this week, both countries announced Tuesday, in what would be the highest-level meeting between the two countries since the pandemic began.
Zhao Leji, who is chairman of the National People’s Congress and considered the No. 3 official in the ruling Communist Party, will visit North Korea from Thursday to Saturday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.

No details were released on what was described as a goodwill visit, except that the delegation would attend the opening ceremony for the “China-North Korea Friendship Year.”
“The specific arrangements for the visit are still under negotiation,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.
A dispatch from North Korea’s official KCNA news agency also announced the trip.
Zhao is one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party’s top leadership body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Zhao’s visit to North Korea will be the first bilateral exchange involving a Chinese Politburo Standing Committee member since the pandemic started. In 2019, the two countries held a pair of summit meetings, for one of which Xi traveled to Pyongyang.
North Korea and China are expected to hold a number of exchanges to mark the 75th year since they established of diplomatic ties, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been pushing to boost partnerships with China and Russia in a bid to strength his regional footing and join a united front against the United States.
Kim traveled to Russia in September for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S., South Korea and others accuse North Korea of supplying conventional weapons for Russia’s war in Ukraine in return for advanced weapons technologies and other support.
China, North Korea’s biggest source of aid, is believed to have long shipped clandestine assistance to help keep afloat its impoverished socialist ally, which it views as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula.
“China is key to North Korea’s economy. There is a limit that Russia can do for North Korea economically,” Park Won Gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. “For the short-term assistance, shipments of food or crude oil can be made. But to make its economy grow in the long term, North Korea needs investments and markets. China is the only country that can provide those to North Korea.” ___

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,82,South Korea to invest $7 billion in AI in effort to retain edge in chips,"Seoul Reuters —
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Tuesday his country will invest 9.4 trillion won ($6.94 billion) in artificial intelligence by 2027 as part of efforts to retain a leading global position in cutting-edge semiconductor chips.
The announcement, which also includes a separate 1.4 trillion won fund to foster AI semiconductor firms, comes as South Korea tries to keep abreast with countries like the United States, China and Japan that are also giving massive policy support to strengthen semiconductor supply chains on their own turf.
Semiconductors are a key foundation of South Korea’s export-driven economy. In March, chip exports reached their highest in 21 months at $11.7 billion, or nearly a fifth of total exports shipped by Asia’s fourth-largest economy.
“Current competition in semiconductors is an industrial war and an all-out war between nations,” Yoon told a meeting of policymakers and chip industry executives on Tuesday.
By earmarking investments and a fund, South Korea plans to significantly expand research and development in AI chips such as artificial neural processing units (NPUs) and next-generation high-bandwidth memory chips, the government said in a statement.
South Korean authorities will also promote the development of next-generation artificial general intelligence (AGI) and safety technologies that go beyond existing models.
Yoon has set a target for South Korea to become one of the top three countries in AI technology including chips, and take a 10% or more share of the global system semiconductor market by 2030.
“Just as we have dominated the world with memory chips for the past 30 years, we will write a new semiconductor myth with AI chips in the next 30 years,” Yoon said.
Yoon also noted that the impact of the recent earthquake in Taiwan, a global leader in semiconductors, on South Korean companies was limited as of now, but ordered thorough preparation in the event of uncertainties.",2024-04-09 07:41:10,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network,82,south president said country invest 94 trillion 694 billion artificial intelligence 2027 part retain leading global position semiconductor announcement also separate 14 trillion fund foster ai semiconductor come south korea keep abreast like united china japan also giving massive policy support strengthen semiconductor supply key foundation south economy march chip highest 21 117 billion nearly fifth total shipped competition industrial war war told meeting chip industry fund south korea significantly expand research development ai chip artificial neural memory chip government said also promote development artificial general intelligence safety go beyond set target south korea become one top three ai technology chip take 10 share global system semiconductor market 2030just dominated world memory chip past 30 write new semiconductor myth ai chip next 30 also noted impact recent earthquake global leader south limited ordered thorough preparation event south korea invest 7 billion ai effort retain edge chip
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,83,"North Korean Paratroopers Injured in Kim-Led Drills, Agency Says","An unknown number of North Korean paratroopers are said to have been injured last month during a high-profile military exercise meant to demonstrate that Kim Jong Un's forces were ""fully prepared for war.""
The March 15 drill—watched by the North Korean leader and his young daughter Ju Ae—involved several airborne units, some of whose soldiers collided with one another as their parachutes failed to fully open in strong winds, South Korean officials told the Yonhap news agency last week.
The training exercise was announced the following day by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, which said it helped Pyongyang judge the ""real war capabilities"" of its forces.""

The KCNA report did not mention any casualties or unexpected incidents. The North Korean Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
Tensions between Pyongyang and Seoul are at their highest level in decades, with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol taking a harder line on his northern neighbor while drawing closer to the United States and Japan.
Kim, meanwhile, has continued a spate of ballistic missile tests, including last week's launch of a nuclear-capable hypersonic warhead, while furthering allying himself with Russia.
The Kremlin, a historical Cold War ally, is thought to be assisting Pyongyang's expanding spy satellite program. In return, Western governments say, Russia has received North Korean-made weapons—ballistic missiles and artillery rounds—which have been used during Russia's war with Ukraine.
Moscow and Pyongyang both deny trading arms, an act that would violate multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, including those supported by Russia.
Last month's large-scale exercise, in which hundreds of North Korean paratroopers were photographed jumping out of cargo planes in a simulated attack on a mock enemy, appeared to be a direct response to the annual Freedom Shield war games held by the U.S. and South Korea.

It took place in a two-week period in which 40-year-old Kim was pictured in state media reports personally guiding military exercises involving battle tank units and rocket forces, often alongside senior Workers' Party officials.

TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,85,From the frying pan to the fire: green onions ignite voter anger in South Korea’s elections,"Yoon Suk Yeol is hardly the first elected politician to appear out of touch with ordinary voters during a cost-of-living crisis. But as South Korea prepares for key national assembly elections on Wednesday, its conservative president has been tripped up by a humble vegetable.
In recent weeks, green onions have gone from a simple staple of Korean cooking to a powerful symbol of voter anger over rising prices in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.
Its ascent from the kitchen into politics came during Yoon’s recent visit to a supermarket in Seoul that was intended to portray him as someone who understands the financial pressures faced by ordinary families.
Yoon said he had been to many markets and described as “reasonable” the store’s 875 won (51p) price tag for a bundle of green onions.

Observers were quick to point out, however, that the items had been only temporarily discounted thanks to government subsidies, while the supermarket had made a further price cut. The actual retail price is three to four times higher, hovering at 3,000-4,000 won in recent weeks.
Yoon’s People Power party is hoping to take control of the 300-seat assembly from a liberal majority led by the opposition Democratic party but the trip to the shops has added to criticism that Yoon appears aloof.
It has fuelled a surge in support for smaller parties that could upset the balance of power and render Yoon a lame-duck leader just two years into his presidency. His party has already been grappling with low approval ratings before the vote, which is being seen as a midterm referendum on Yoon’s administration.
Dining out on onion memes
It is not just the price of green onions that has seen significant rises. The price of agricultural products in March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The price of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.

Nevertheless, opposition candidates have used green onions as props during campaign speeches to draw attention to Yoon’s hapless attempt to court the average man and woman on the Seoul omnibus.
Social media was awash with onion memes, with some users posting photographs of green onions outside polling stations after the National Election Commission banned green onions from the locations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”.
“While people’s expression of political views should be respected to the maximum level, using a certain item as a means of expression other than for their original purpose has great potential to affect the election,” the commission said.
Hyun Jung, 36, said she hadn’t initially thought about the green onion issue, “but after I heard about the ban, I bought a green onion hairband and I’m determined to wear it on election day”.
If Yoon’s party fails to win more seats and take control of the assembly, Yoon risks seeing out the remaining three years of his term struggling to pass his policy agenda.
“If the People Power party is still a minority party after the general election … cooperation with the National Assembly will be very difficult,” Kang Joo-hyun, a professor of political science and international relations at Sookmyung Women’s University, told Agence France-Presse. “The president will become a lame duck quickly and … the power of state affairs will be greatly reduced.”
In a Gallup survey on 31 March, the opposition Democratic party, led by Lee Jae-myung, was polling slightly ahead of Yoon’s party – 37% to 35%.
The opposition parties are framing the votes as “judgment day”, suggesting that it is not just about choosing political candidates but also an opportunity for the public to send a strong message to the government over its handling of the economy.
Yoon, whose scandal-hit wife has been conspicuously absent from the campaign, is battling low approval ratings. His popularity did, though, gain momentum after he announced an increase in medical school trainees. The move was criticised by thousands of trainee doctors who have been on strike since February but voters who are worried about the country’s ability to care for its fast-ageing population have supported the move.
A four-week-old potential kingmaker
Disaffection with the political establishment has given smaller parties a rare opportunity to gain ground, including the Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk.
On the eve of the election Cho, whose party is competing only for the 46 seats contested through proportional representation, was polling neck-and-neck with the ruling party, despite being launched only four weeks ago, and is forecast to win between 10 and 15 seats.

Securing about 15 seats would enable Cho’s party to potentially form a coalition that could prevent the People Power party from regaining control of the assembly.
“If the opposition parties gain a significant number of seats … Yoon regime’s system will be shaken, and cracks will appear,” said Cho.
“The People Power party will be divided. The president will become a lame duck, and then a dead duck,” said Cho, who was forced to abandon his presidential ambitions by the 2019 scandal.
Suh Pureunhaneul, a restaurant employee in Seoul, summed up popular disaffection with the established parties, especially over the prohibitive cost of housing in the capital.
“It feels like they’re just promoting measures to maintain land prices rather than addressing what I really need,” he said. “Looking at the election, it feels like there’s no one I want to vote for. I wonder if voting would even make a difference.”",2024-04-09 04:55:28,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian,85,hardly first politician appear touch ordinary crisis south korea key national assembly conservative president humble recent green gone simple staple cooking powerful symbol voter anger rising ascent kitchen politics came recent visit supermarket intended portray someone financial faced ordinary said many reasonable 875 51p price tag bundle green image south president c mart branch check price green visit would political photograph quick point however temporarily thanks government supermarket made price cut actual retail price three four time higher hovering 30004000 recent people power party take control 300seat assembly liberal majority led opposition democratic party trip added criticism surge support smaller could upset balance power render lameduck leader two presidency party already grappling low approval vote seen referendum onion price green seen significant price agricultural march 20 month last year price nearly 90 marking since 1980view image cho korea party supporter wearing cap covered green photograph lee opposition used green prop campaign draw attention hapless attempt court average man woman medium awash onion posting green outside polling national election commission green electoral expression political maximum level certain item expression original purpose great potential affect election commission 36 said initially thought green onion issue ban bought green onion hairband determined wear election party win take control assembly seeing three term struggling pas policy people power party still minority party general election … national assembly difficult kang professor political science international university told president become lame duck quickly … power state greatly survey 31 march opposition democratic party led lee polling slightly ahead party 37 35the opposition framing judgment day suggesting choosing political also opportunity public send strong message government handling whose wife conspicuously absent campaign low approval popularity though gain momentum increase medical school move trainee strike since worried ability care population potential political establishment given smaller rare opportunity gain ground korea party led former justice minister cho eve election cho whose party 46 proportional representation polling ruling party despite four ago forecast win 10 15 image south main opposition democratic party leader lee helmet decorated green gaffe photograph 15 would enable party potentially form coalition could prevent people power party control opposition gain significant number … system shaken appear said people power party divided president become lame duck dead duck said cho forced abandon presidential 2019 restaurant employee summed popular disaffection established especially prohibitive cost housing like theyre maintain land rather really need said looking election like there one want vote wonder voting would even make difference pan fire green ignite voter anger south
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,86,"US envoy to UN to visit Korean border, North Korean defectors","The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will travel to the heavily armed Korean border and meet North Korean defectors in South Korea, her office said on Monday, amid faltering U.N. efforts to ensure sanctions enforcement against the North.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield's trip, set for April 14-20, came after Russia rejected the annual renewal of the multinational panel of experts which has over the past 15 years worked on the implementation of U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo criticised Moscow's veto and China's abstention, which experts said would undermine the sanctions enforcement, with a South Korean envoy likening it to ""destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed.""
Thomas-Greenfield's trip, which will also include a stop in Japan, was meant to advance bilateral and trilateral cooperation on the sanctions and beyond, U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson Nate Evans said. Both South Korea and Japan are currently members of the Security Council.
""In both countries, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield will discuss next steps to ensure a continuation of independent and accurate reporting of the DPRK's ongoing weapons proliferation and sanctions evasion activities,"" Evans said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In South Korea, Thomas-Greenfield will travel to the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas, meet young North Korean defectors as well as students at Ewha Womans University, Evans said.
In Japan, she will also meet family members of Japanese citizens who were abducted in the early 2000s by North Korea, and visit Nagasaki, which was hit by U.S. nuclear bombing in 1945.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,88,"F1 News: 1 Month After Revealing $90 Million Plan, Korea Makes Massive Stride in Joining F1 Again","The Formula 1 calendar has been expanding quite rapidly in the last few years with 2024 being the longest F1 season in the history of the sport. The introduction of new tracks like the Miami International Autodrome and the Las Vegas Strip Circuit has been hugely successful. And now it looks like Korea is trying to capitalize on F1’s recent success by building a new track centered around the Incheon district, which lies close to the capital city, Seoul. This new circuit will aim to recover from the failure of the purpose-built track near Mokpo in the southwest region of the country that hosted the Korean Grand Prix between 2010 and 2013.
Just about a month ago, the Incheon International Airport Corporation announced its plans to construct a new circuit in hopes of reviving the South Korean Grand Prix. According to a recent report from Autoweek.com, last weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix served as a crucial moment to realizing that dream as the mayor of Incheon, Yoo Jeong-bok, met with Formula 1 CEO, Stefano Domenicali to submit an official letter of intent.
As per a construction official, the goal is to create unique attractions for foreign tourists, with motorsports being a focal point. The proposed motorsports-centered tourism and leisure complex is expected to draw in an impressive 200,000 visitors who would also attend the race, generating an estimated $90 million in revenue. And while there is no immediate rush, a tentative starting point for the comeback could be either 2026 or 2027, with a street-style event being the likely format.

Max Verstappen Responds to Toto Wolff’s Flattery Attempt in 5 Words as Mercedes Move Looms Large
While the addition of new races to the F1 calendar is an exciting prospect for the fans with more action coming their way, the drivers have clearly not been happy with the ever-expanding race season.
Formula 1 drivers questioned the sustainability aspect of a 24-race-long season ahead of the 2024 season opener
In a press conference ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the drivers didn’t hold back in criticizing the growing number of races in the F1 calendar. The trigger for this debate was Stefano Domenicali’s previous suggestion that the sport could eventually host as many as 30 races in a season.
One of the main concerns pointed out by drivers like Carlos Sainz was the toll it takes on everyone involved in the sport, from drivers to mechanics and even journalists. “It’s just on the limit of being too much and I really hope it just doesn’t go much higher than 24 because if not I think it’s going to be very tricky for everyone,” said Carlos. Lewis Hamilton also shared a similar sentiment, emphasizing the need to prioritize quality over quantity. He raised environmental concerns, pointing out the carbon footprint generated by the amount of traveling involved in hosting so many races across the globe. George Russell also thought along similar lines.

Reigning world champion, Max Verstappen and double world champion, Fernando Alonso also criticized the sport, candidly stating that the current schedule was simply unsustainable. Verstappen, in particular, expressed concerns about the toll it takes on drivers’ careers and personal lives, hinting at the possibility of early retirements if the trend wasn’t kept in check.

Alonso later referenced the Dutchman’s comments saying, “Even the world champion thinks that it’s a little bit long, the season. Imagine for the rest of us that we go to the races in the second half for nothing – there is no incentive to fight for anything.”

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,89,Deaths From Doctor Shortage Fuel Election Angst in Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- In March 2023, a 17-year-old girl who fell from a building in the South Korean city of Daegu died after her ambulance was turned away by three hospitals that lacked doctors to treat her.
She was among more than 3,750 patients who have died since 2017 after local hospitals refused to provide care, according to a report by Cheong Yooseok, a professor of medical science at Dankook University in Cheonan city.
The startling statistic from one of Asia’s richest countries has become a major issue in the parliamentary elections taking place on April 10. While the country won acclaim for its low fatality rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus now is on inefficiency, waste and skewed economic incentives in the health-care system.
Renowned medical centers in Seoul are overwhelmed by patients, while the rest of the country struggles with a lack of physicians. A six-week-and-counting national walk-out by nearly 13,000 residents and interns protesting a plan to boost medical school enrollment has exacerbated the situation.
Seung-Pyo Jung, an esophageal cancer patient who lives on Jeju Island in south, flew to Seoul National University Bandung Hospital for surgery last June. While he’s supposed to have checkups every four weeks, sometimes it takes several months to get an appointment.
“There’s no doctor at all on this island who can treat esophageal cancer,"" Jung said of his hometown, which has a population of almost 700,000 people. “Everything is so concentrated in Seoul.""
The Korean Emergency Medical Association, which advocates for doctors working at emergency centers, warned that it may join the protest. Meanwhile, the health ministry said it’s willing to discuss the Korean Medical Association’s efforts to delay the plan to increase medical school enrollment if the group has a scientific, rational and unified proposal.
Health Care Collapse
Korea has among the fewest doctors per capita of all developed countries and hasn’t increased the number of medical students in more than two decades, said Gaetan Lafortune, a senior economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Demographic factors like the rapidly aging population will exacerbate the scarcity, he said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has vowed to address the crisis. He proposed measures, like increasing the number of doctors, that have drawn complaints for being “populist moves"" ahead of the election to select the 300 member National Assembly.
While his conservative People Power Party is currently in power, he’s trying to flip dozens of seats held by his progressive rivals, led by the Democratic Party, to take control of the national legislature.
The health-care system is “collapsing,"" Yoon said at a public hearing in February. “Now is the golden time to push reforms.""
Yet the doctors themselves oppose efforts to expand physician supply, arguing that the government’s proposal to increase medical school enrollment by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058 doesn’t address the root problem.
This, they say, is that doctor pay in some critical fields covered by the country’s National Health Insurance system is far lower than that for outside specialists, especially those who do cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. The disparity in compensation and infrastructure between Seoul and rural areas also means a dearth of medical workers outside the capital.

Disappearing Doctors
“Doctors are disappearing at emergency centers, surgery rooms, delivery rooms, and hospitals in smaller cities,"" said Cheong, from Dankook University, in a December report. “Many young doctors gave up becoming fellows at medical colleges and work in the beauty industry.""
Cosmetic surgery has aggressively taken hold and medical tourism is booming in South Korea. More than 8 million foreign patients arrived between 2009 and 2022, many for the beauty industry that offers ubiquitous access to plastic surgery, Botox for $6 per shot, and laser skin tightening.
Meanwhile, essential fields including pediatrics have been hard hit. Only 53 residents applied to fill 205 pediatric slots for this year, and just eight were outside Seoul and its surroundings, according to the health ministry. For pediatric surgery, two trainee doctors applied for spots outside of the greater Seoul area.
In June 2023, the Korean Pediatric Society held a conference titled “How to Exit Pediatrics"" focused on learning about other disciplines including cosmetic surgery. The seminar was done at the behest of members who said the country’s ultra-low birth rate made it difficult to run pediatric clinics, officials said in a television interview with Channel A.
Outside Seoul
The situation is dire in most parts of the country.
More than half of Korea’s 114,000 doctors and dentists worked in Seoul or Gyeonggi province in 2022, according to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.
Hiring doctors outside the capital is tough, said Cho Seung-yeon, president of Incheon Medical Center. He couldn’t find anyone to lead the dialysis division for two years. Another public hospital offered $1 million for a cardiologist, he said.
Salaried doctors at private clinics can earn in excess of $300,000 annually, while those on their own make even more, he said. Cho offers $200,000 a year for physicians at his public hospital in Incheon, but he said few ultimately come.
Even in Seoul, medical care can be tenuous given the doctor shortage.
Kim Sung Ju, a 62-year-old who underwent surgery for esophageal cancer a decade ago, undergoes a battery of tests and waits hours for a brief visit with his doctor at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital in Gangnam, an upscale neighborhood in the city’s southeast, every three months.
“I really don’t understand why I have to visit this big hospital every three months, because I only get to talk to my doctor for three minutes,"" he said. “I had thought Korea’s health insurance system, with private doctors and national health insurance, was the world’s best, but now it’s becoming the world’s worst.""
A more robust medical work force is also essential to the country’s public health, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which has just 20 doctors out of 500 employees.
“We hope just two doctors join us a year,"" said Hong Jeong-ik, director-general of the bureau of public health emergency preparedness. “They can do something meaningful for the public, even if that may not help them make huge a profit.""
Amid the national debate, wait times for care have worsened since the doctors’ walkout to protest Yoon’s proposed reforms. The president says he won’t back down on what he calls a “minimum requirement"" for fixing the underlying issues. Nearly four-in-five Koreans support the expansion, polling ahead of the election shows.
“A nurse died in August 2022 at the one of Korea’s best hospitals, where she worked, because there was no doctor to treat her,"" Health and Welfare Minister Cho KyooHong said in an interview. “This is not right.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,90,Biden’s Envoy to the UN Set to Visit Border With North Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- The US ambassador to the United Nations will travel to the North Korean border as the Biden administration looks to reaffirm support for Asian allies and draw attention to a breakdown in Security Council unity over efforts to rein in Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal.
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield will become the most senior US official to visit the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas since Vice President Kamala Harris went there in 2022. US mission spokesman Nate Evans said it’s part of a bigger week-long trip to South Korea and Japan, both of which are current members of the Security Council.
While the trip has been planned for some time, Thomas-Greenfield heads to the region soon after Russia vetoed a US-led Security Council resolution to extend the mandate of a panel of experts that has monitored North Korea’s nuclear-weapons development for 15 years. She’ll also be in Washington DC this week for a US summit with the leaders of Japan and the Philippines.
Such extensions were once routine but have run up against growing divisions in the council between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine and what the US says is Moscow’s push to secure weapons and ammunition from Pyongyang. North Korea also continues to make progress on its nuclear program in defiance of numerous Security Council resolutions.
Thomas-Greenfield will be briefed by military officials at the demilitarized zone. She also plans to meet civilians, including North Korean defectors, during her trip to South Korea, Evans said.
Thomas-Greenfield will also head to Japan, where she will meet officials to discuss shared priorities at the UN. She’ll also hear from family members of Japanese citizens abducted by Kim Jong Un’s regime.
(Updates with ambassador traveling to DC for summit in third paragraph. A previous version of this story corrected to say the US envoy will meet defectors during her South Korea visit, not at the DMZ.)

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,91,"China might use AI to disrupt the forthcoming US election, says Microsoft","What you need to know
Microsoft has published a report highlighting how China is leveraging AI to disrupt elections across South Korea, India, and the US.
The tech giant details that China's threat to the electoral process ""remains low"" but warns it could get severe with time as its deceitful ploys become more sophisticated.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had previously indicated that there's enough power to protect the integrity of the US presidential election, alongside the company's plan to empower voters with authoritative news regarding the election via Bing.
With the prevalence of generative AI and chatbots, misinformation is becoming more widespread. Microsoft recently shared a new report highlighting how China is misappropriating the tech, spanning from AI-generated memes designed to fuel outrage over Japan's disposal of nuclear wastewater to spreading malicious rumors indicating that the US government is behind the tragic wildfire in Hawaii and Kentucky's train derailment.
According to the tech giant:
""As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections.""
Further in the report, Microsoft indicated that it anticipates China will leverage AI-based ploys to interfere with high-profile elections this year. Several social media accounts believed to belong to Chinese users have been spotted spreading politically concocted AI-generated information. Moreover, the accounts would ask followers to interact with the posts by asking which presidential candidate they are supporting.
Microsoft speculates that China intends to use its position and AI to brew more chaos, ultimately allowing it to benefit from the high-profile elections. While the tech giant indicates the issue isn't severe, it warns the situation is highly likely to change:
""While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line.""
Microsoft's report complements the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's threat assessment of China. Both reports mentioned Storm-1376, a Beijing-based group known as ""Spamouflage"" that is believed to be behind Taiwan's electoral process disruptions via AI-generated content.

What's Microsoft doing to prevent the issue from becoming widespread?
(Image credit: Daniel Rubino | Bing Image Creator)
Last year, Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) was spotted misleading voters and users with false information regarding the forthcoming US election. Researchers indicated that the issue was systemic, after establishing a pattern. The chatbot had also been spotted providing false information about the election process in Germany and Switzerland.
But Microsoft has been putting elaborate measures and ramping up it efforts to prevent this situation from spiraling out of control.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,94,South Korea says second spy satellite placed in orbit,"As it stands now, polls have Trump and Biden effectively tied, meaning that there’s an opportunity, some might call it a moral imperative, to sway the country away from the dystopian future in which Trump triumphs.
But how exactly do we change voters’ minds?
POLL: Should Trump be allowed to run for office?
One might believe it’s just a matter of making a persuasive argument, loaded with empirical facts and sound logic, articulated with perfect clarity. This is what the left-wing media often believes, and we have seen how successful that strategy has been — Donald Trump is as influential as ever.
But what if I told you that our neural wiring determines whether we have the ability to change our minds? What if I told you that science suggests conservatives, who are extremely likely to be voting for Trump this election, generally have more rigid cognitive systems, which means they are less adaptable, and therefore, less likely to adopt a new framework or perspective when their approach fails?
A seminal study by social psychologist David Amodio and colleagues at New York University suggests that the typical conservative is not likely to be convinced by something as simple as a logically persuasive argument. For some conservatives, it's like asking them to change the color of their eyes. A progressive worldview cannot pierce their psyche because being dogmatic is programmed into the fabric of that worldview. It is not just that they are “stubborn”; their brains are actually wired to resist things that are new and different. So, you could say they lack “free will” when it comes to their voting decision. When we speak of free will in a modern sense, we are talking about the personal agency that enables one to override ingrained biases and consider alternative perspectives.
To understand the implications of this study, we must voyage into the realm of neuroscience, where secrets of the mind await discovery. The ERN, which stands for “error related negativity,” is a spike in brain activity that is triggered when we commit an error. It serves as a kind of internal alert system within our brain, signaling when a mistake has been made. It emerges in the brain region known as the anterior cingulate cortex, which helps us navigate situations where established patterns or behaviors are ineffective and require adjustment. For example, if a person is learning to play a musical instrument and hits a wrong note, the ERN might spike, prompting them to correct their finger positioning and playing style. Over time, as they practice and adapt, the frequency of these ERN spikes will decrease, indicating improved proficiency and fewer mistakes.
RELATED: This complete psychological analysis reveals 14 key traits that explain Trump supporters
Armed with a knowledge of the nature of the ERN, Dr. Amodio and colleagues ventured into the terrain of politics. Their highly-cited 2007 study revealed an illuminating connection between one's political orientation and the intensity of the ERN response. What they found was that participants with liberal views exhibited a more pronounced ERN. This suggests they have a heightened sensitivity to error signals, indicating a cognitive system that acknowledges the need for adjustments in perspective and strategy. Essentially, when their established behavioral patterns were shown to be incorrect or suboptimal, their brains signaled more intensely for an adaptive response. From these findings, we can conclude that progressive-minded individuals possess a neural predisposition for recognizing the need for change and growth.
Conservatives, on the other hand, exhibited a smaller ERN. This suggests that their cognitive system is more resistant to signals advocating for change or reconsideration. We can think of this as a neural reflection of their preference for stability, tradition and consistency. The typical conservative voter’s mental landscape, sculpted by a combination of genetics and indoctrinating experiences, values the familiar and reliable. Established norms and long-held beliefs provide a safe harbor in the face of a changing society and an uncertain future. It's a mindset where radical shifts or sudden upheavals are perceived not as opportunities but threats to a delicate equilibrium. Conservatism is essentially a neurocognitive inclination aimed at preserving the status quo.
So, what are we supposed to take away from these results? Does it mean there’s no hope for shifting anyone’s stances this election?
One might reasonably conclude that we should simply focus on getting all those already on our ideological side to turn out to the polls on voting day.
But using that strategy alone is risky. We should not give up hope in spreading a progressive worldview, because resistance to change and evolution eventually leads to societal collapse. History has unequivocally demonstrated that. Adaptivity is the key to individual and collective survival. This means we have an ethical obligation to be evangelists for progress and sensible change. This will require a bit of social engineering and some creativity.
Persuading the conservatives intending to vote for Trump is not about convincing them with logic; it is about understanding and navigating their innate preference for stability and tradition. By recognizing the inherent gravitation toward consistency, we see that the presentation of facts or data might not be the most persuasive tool. Effective persuasion demands an approach that's strategically empathetic. Rather than challenging the core of their beliefs head-on, it’s far more effective to frame arguments in a way that resonates with their intrinsic values — stability, tradition and consistency. Narratives and stories that weave in those facts that resonate with their core values will be more compelling. Presenting change not as a rupture, but as a natural evolution of the existing order, can be a more palatable and effective narrative.
To truly sway Republican voters, we must employ more than just arguments. It demands a properly balanced mix of genuine empathy, clever communication strategy and a basic grasp of the neurocognitive biases shaping their perspectives.
In the end, the outcome of the election may well hinge on our ability to navigate the cognitive labyrinth of the conservative mind.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,95,South Korea launches its second military spy satellite,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea has successfully launched its second military spy satellite into orbit, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year — North Korea in November and South Korea in December — amid heightened animosities. They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.
South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it confirmed the satellite entered orbit and communicated with an overseas ground station after separation from a rocket.
“With the success of the second military spy satellite launch, our military has acquired an additional independent surveillance ability and further bolstered our ‘kill chain’ capability,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha Gyu told reporters, referring to the military’s preemptive missile strike capability.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025. South Korea’s first spy satellite launch on Dec. 1 was made from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base.
South Korea in 2022 became the world’s 10th nation to successfully launch a satellite with its own technology by using a homegrown rocket to place what it called a “performance observation satellite” in orbit. But experts say it’s economical to use a SpaceX rocket to launch spy satellite and that South Korea needs more launches to ensure the reliability of a rocket.
North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik said Monday that North Korea will likely go ahead with its second spy satellite launch soon to mark the April 15 birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Shin said it’s still possible for the North to perform the launch later due to technical reasons.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response. Experts say North Korea likely believes that an enlarged weapons arsenals would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.

SEOUL, April 8 (UPI) -- South Korea successfully placed its second military reconnaissance satellite into orbit, Seoul's military said Monday, a move that will heighten surveillance capabilities against North Korea amid a growing space race on the peninsula. The launch took place on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which was Monday morning in Seoul, South Korea's Defense Ministry said in a press release. Advertisement
The satellite was carried on a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and successfully entered orbit around 45 minutes after launch. It later succeeded in communicating with a ground station, the ministry said.
In addition to increased surveillance capacity, the satellite will enhance South Korea's ""Kill Chain"" system, the ministry added. The Kill Chain is part of a three-pronged deterrence strategy that calls for preemptive strikes against the North's missiles -- and possibly its leadership -- in the event of a potential attack.
Monday's launch marked the second of five military reconnaissance satellites that Seoul has contracted with SpaceX to place into orbit by 2025. South Korea launched its first satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Dec. 1, less than two weeks after North Korea placed its own inaugural spy satellite into orbit.

The new satellite is equipped with synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, which can capture images at night and under any weather conditions, defense officials said.
""With the success of this launch, our military has further strengthened its space-based surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,"" South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said after viewing a live stream of the launch at ministry headquarters. ""Now, even in bad weather, it has become possible to monitor the whole of North Korea clearly and precisely.""
North Korea announced plans last week to launch several more spy satellites of its own this year, amid concerns over its growing military relationship with Russia.
Washington and its allies say that Pyongyang is shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
Shin said that the South's satellite technology is far superior to that of the North and promised that upcoming launches will further widen the gap in the space race.
""By next year, we plan to launch a follow-up military reconnaissance satellite and an ultra-small satellite that is currently under development,"" he said.

Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The launch, which comes after Seoul’s first spy satellite was put into orbit from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base in December, was livestreamed on social media platforms X and YouTube.
The Falcon 9 rocket was launched at 7:17 p.m. ET on Sunday and the satellite successfully separated from the launch vehicle 45 minutes later and entered its targeted orbit, the ministry said in a statement.
It made successful communications with a ground station about two hours and 40 minutes after the launch, the ministry added.
The back-to-back launches of reconnaissance satellites come amid a race against North Korea for military capabilities in space.
After two earlier attempts ended in rocket crashes, Pyongyang said in November last year that it used its own Chollima-1 launch vehicle to place the Malligyong-1 reconnaissance satellite in orbit.
North Korea has previously vowed to launch three new spy satellites in 2024.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik told reporters that North Korea could launch a second spy satellite as early as mid-April, the Yonhap news agency reported.
Shin’s comment was based on the military’s observation of North Korea’s related activities, South Korean defense ministry spokesman Jeon Ha-gyu told a briefing.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,99,Japan’s pivot away from peace reflects new world order,"In 2022, Japan announced its biggest military build-up since World War II with an ambitious five-year spending plan that included buying missiles capable of striking China. Japan is earmarking a record ¥7.7 trillion ($77 billion) for its defence budget in fiscal 2024 in what the local media are calling an “intense arms build-up”.
The government wants to expand its annual defence budget to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027, from just 1 per cent now.
Joe Biden and Fumio Kishida at a Camp David meeting with South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol last year. AP
Reimagining its security alliances in an increasingly hostile region is the next logical step in Japan’s defence push.
To this end, it is poised to be included in the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine agreement with Australia, the US and the United Kingdom, a widely flagged idea likely to be formalised when Kishida meets US President Joe Biden in Washington this week.
There is some irony in this, given Australia dumped Japan in 2016 in favour of France to build its new submarine fleet. However, Japan’s inclusion will be limited to the Pillar II elements of the alliance covering military technology. It will have nothing to do with the nuclear-powered submarine element of the pact.
Advertisement
It also cements a shift in the way Japan wants to manage its other alliances in the region.
Japan sees Australia as a key partner and no longer wishes to rely solely on the US as its main protector. It is also boosting defence ties with South Korea despite the countries’ historical grievances.
An important driver for the flurry of activity is a sense that time is running out for both Kishida and Biden.
Kishida’s popularity ratings are in the toilet, and he is unlikely to be around in a year, and the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House in November leaves a question mark over US-Japan defence ties.
Talk of welcoming Japan into an alliance that many in Tokyo joke should be renamed JAUKUS has been around since the agreement was first announced in 2021. Japan’s former prime minister Taro Aso advocated the move in a speech in Canberra late last year.
Strategically, Japan’s role as a partner in the aspects of AUKUS that cover military technology makes sense, given its advanced manufacturing and defence capabilities.

“Japan has a lot to contribute in certain areas: space technologies and missile technologies, anti-submarine and undersea surveillance technologies, hypersonics, [and] submarine technology just to name a few, and its advanced manufacturing is world-class,” says Grant Newsham, a senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies.
“And don’t forget that Japan has got a lot of money to invest in all this. It’s not as if the British and the Australians are rolling in dough they can invest in defence. Even the Americans claim to be tapped out when it comes to defence.”
Inferior cybersecurity capabilities
A big obstacle until recently has been Japan’s inferior cybersecurity and counter-espionage capabilities, which have lagged those of the US, Australia and the UK. Japan is not a member of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network.
The other hurdle has been Japan’s pacifist constitution, which allows the country to defend itself but not to attack.
Japan has already shown its willingness to skirt these restrictions by providing surface-to-air missiles to the United States as part of indirect military aid to Ukraine.

Although Kishida has failed to shine in many aspects of Japanese policymaking, diplomats and analysts say defence is the exception.
His popularity ratings, currently at record lows following a funding scandal in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), peaked when he visited Ukraine in March last year. His advisers hope this week’s trip to Washington will give him a much-needed boost in the polls.
Importantly, the Japanese people seem to be on board with Kishida’s more hawkish approach to global security.
They are increasingly concerned about the country’s hostile neighbours and whether Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sets a precedent for Beijing to make territorial claims over nearby Taiwan, and even over Japanese territory such as the island chain of Okinawa. Russia, too, has claims over Japan’s so-called “Northern Territories”.
In a rare interview with US media outlets, Kishida made it clear what was driving Japan’s shift in strategy.
“As we are witnessing Russia’s Ukraine aggression, the continuing situation over the Middle East, as well as the situation in East Asia, we are faced with a historic turning point,” Kishida told CNN on Sunday.

North Korea is also eager to acquire its own space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls military threats posed by the United States and South Korea.
After two launch failures earlier in 2023, North Korea placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit on Nov. 21. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos, and foreign experts doubt whether the North Korean satellite can transmit militarily meaningful imagery.
On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, vice general director of the North’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said North Korea is expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. During a key political conference in late December, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to launch three additional military spy satellite in 2024.
South Korean Defense Minister Shin Wonsik said Monday that North Korea will likely go ahead with its second spy satellite launch soon to mark the April 15 birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Shin said it’s still possible for the North to perform the launch later due to technical reasons.
The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting a satellite launch, considering it as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology. The North’s November satellite launch deepened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with both Koreas taking steps to breach their 2018 agreement to lower down military tensions.
In recent years, North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests to modernize and expand its weapons arsenals, prompting the U.S. and South Korea to strengthen their military drills in response. Experts say North Korea likely believes that an enlarged weapons arsenals would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the U.S.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,101,"Global fact-checkers battle harassment, threats, financial perils","From India and South Korea to Croatia and North Macedonia, fact-checking organizations battling an ever-rising tide of misinformation in a major election year are buffeted by legal threats, harassment and funding shortfalls.Fact-checkers, largely under-resourced and increasingly under attack, have their work cut out this year as dozens of countries hold elections, a period when falsehoods typically explode.Debunking fake political claims and hoaxes that threaten election integrity, likened by some researchers as a seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole, comes with a litany of challenges that are piling pressure on fact-checkers in a crucial year.The most significant is raising funds to sustain operations, according to a new survey by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) of 137 organizations across 69 countries.The Seoul National University (SNU) FactCheck Center, South Korea's only local debunking platform, faces possible shutdown after its biggest donor -- the search engine company Naver -- pulled financial support last year.Naver declined to comment on the reason, but the outfit's director Chong Eun-ryung believes ""political pressure"" from the ruling People Power Party was the ""biggest factor.""SNU FactCheck Center has been accused of bias by ruling party lawmakers, a charge it rejects.The development follows the closure of another outfit, Fact-check Net, last year after the government cut off its funding.'Information warfare'""Fact-checkers are facing growing amounts of misinformation with limited resources for reporting and publishing,"" Angie Drobnic Holan, director of IFCN, told AFP.""There are also campaigns of online and legal harassment against fact-checkers from those who prefer more cutthroat information warfare, without checks based on evidence and logic.""The IFCN survey said about 72 percent of organizations faced harassment, while many also reported physical and legal threats.Croatian fact-checking website Faktograf.hr has been forced to invest in security measures after its staff received death threats and female reporters faced sexist insults, executive director Ana Brakus told AFP.A text message received by one staff member warned that his fingers would be ""cut off.""""We had to find ways to deal with that kind of stress"" without affecting the fact-checking mission, Brakus said, adding the organization offered mental health support to its staff.In India, home to the largest number of certified fact-checkers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- tipped to win a third consecutive term in upcoming parliamentary elections -- has been accused of stifling independent media.Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of Alt News and a frequent target of government rebuke, continues to face legal threats after being briefly jailed in 2022 over accusations that he insulted a Hindi god in a tweet four years earlier.During a fundraising drive on X, formerly Twitter, Zubair wrote Indian media organizations were being ""forced to censor themselves"" and in some cases, ""becoming government mouthpieces.""'Existential threats'With their shoestring budgets, many fact-checkers must turn to external funding support to defend themselves against the ""existential threats"" that lawsuits -- often frivolous -- present, the IFCN report said.In some cases, fact-checkers are themselves targeted by disinformation.Truthmeter, the fact-checking service of the North Macedonia-based Metamorphosis Foundation, faced a sweeping smear campaign earlier this year after its fact-checks of Facebook posts prompted accusations that it was censoring content.The campaign, the group said in a note to readers, escalated into insults, slander and ""badly disguised calls for violence"" against its staff.""We are fully aware that such disinformation campaigns, full of attacks, manipulations, threats and hate speech will continue, especially in the pre-election period,"" it said, as North Macedonia gears up for the presidential race later this month.Content moderation on social media has become a hot-button issue even in advanced economies such as the United States -- which faces elections in November -- with many users equating fact-checking with censorship.""'Who fact-checks the fact-checkers?' is a common response to our work,"" said Eric Litke, who heads a US-based fact-checker, stressing the need for transparency to gain reader trust.Fact-checking organizations, including AFP -- which debunks misinformation as part of Meta's third-party fact-checking program -- routinely face online abuse from people who dispute their ratings, sometimes even when they peddle blatantly false information.""I've watched this movement label fact-checkers as part of a 'censorship industrial complex,'"" said Holan.""Ironically, this deeply misleading argument itself is aimed at

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,102,South Korea’s spring festivals disappoint as cherry trees blossom late,"CHANGWON - South Korea’s flower festivals in 2024 have so far fallen short of expectations as cherry trees did not reach their blossom peak in time.
The Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival Day Tour in Changwon, South Gyeongsang province, saw a drop of about 1.2 million visitors in 2024, a Changwon official told South Korean media.
While 4.2 million people visited the most well-known cherry blossom festival in South Korea in 2023, the city tallied the number of visitors at three million during the 10 days of the 2024 festival, which ended on April 1.
The blooms were expected on 360,000 trees planted in the area’s parks and naval bases, but the blooming rate remained at only 15 per cent on March 23, the first day of the festival.
Other famous cherry blossom festivals, including those in Yeouido and Jamsil in Seoul, also ended with many of the flowers still in the bud stage. The number of visitors to the Yeouido festival was less than half of 2023’s figure, according to media reports.
The festivals’ dates had been brought forward compared with previous years’ as the date when the flowers bloom has gradually become earlier. For 2024, it was forecast to be even earlier.
Festivals in Changwon and Seoul were brought forward by a week from the previous year.
But this March saw colder temperatures and less sunshine than average, which experts say resulted in inaccurate earlier forecasts on bloom peaks.
The inaccurate predictions were embarrassing for the authorities as the spring festivals have been an important opportunity for local businesses to promote their products.
Some cities decided to postpone their spring festivals, or even hold another festival.
Sokcho city in Gangwon province launched a second cherry blossom festival on April 6, a week after its first festival ended.
A post uploaded on the city’s social media account reads: “We deserve to die for our mistake, but we could not control the season.” The city explained it had to hold the festival twice because of the lack of blossoms.
Gangneung city in Gangwon province also opened its Gyeongpo Cherry Blossom Festival on April 6, after delaying it by a week from March 29.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,103,Reports of workplace abuse in South Korea double over past 5 years,"SEOUL – More than 10,000 cases of workplace abuse were reported to the authorities in 2023, the labour ministry said on April 7, marking a steep increase every year since the government started compiling such reports in 2019.
According to the Ministry of Employment and Labour, it received 10,028 reports of workplace abuse in 2023, up 12 per cent from 8,961 the year before.
South Korea in 2019 revised the Labour Standards Act to stipulate in Articles 76-2 and 76-3 the prohibition against workplace harassment and the appropriate measures to be taken in such cases.
The ministry started keeping track of reports of workplace abuse in the second half of 2019, during which 2,130 cases were reported.
In the following years, the figure reached 5,823 in 2020 and 7,774 in 2021, and is continuing its upward trajectory.
The most common form of workplace harassment reported in 2023 was verbal abuse at 32.8 per cent, followed by inappropriate measures related to human resources at 13.8 per cent.
Of the 10,028 reported cases in 2024, officials took action on 9,672 cases, while 356 cases are still being processed.
In 2,884 cases, those accused of workplace abuse had been found to not have violated the law or the case itself did not occur in a workplace subject to the Labour Standard Act. The act can be applied to workplaces that regularly employ at least five people.
In 2,197 cases, the accuser had dropped the charges.
Only 57 cases led to an indictment as the law specifies criminal punishment only for the act of the employer firing or unfavourably treating the employee who reported an incident of workplace abuse, which can be punished by up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won (S$30,000).
The maximum punishment for other violations is a 10 million won administrative fine, which does not remain on the offender’s criminal record.
Surveys indicate that the actual number of workplace abuse incidents is much higher than what the government report suggests, but many employees facing such abuse do not report it for fear of retribution.
In February, local pollster Hankook Research announced the results of its survey of 1,000 employees across the country, which showed that 46 per cent of respondents have experienced some level of abuse at work.
About 33 per cent of them said they chose to do nothing, while 31 per cent said they quit their job and 25 per cent said they sought help from those around them.
Only 8 per cent reported the case to organisations outside the company.
The same survey showed that 96 per cent of respondents thought that the legal clause banning workplace harassment should be applied to all workers, including those working for an employer with less than five employees.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,104,Deaths from doctor shortage fuel election angst in South Korea,"SEOUL – In March 2023, a 17-year-old girl who fell from a building in the South Korean city of Daegu died after her ambulance was turned away by three hospitals that lacked doctors to treat her.
She was among more than 3,750 patients who have died since 2017 after local hospitals refused to provide care, according to a report by Professor Cheong Yooseok from Dankook University in Cheonan city.
The startling statistic from one of Asia’s richest countries has become a major issue in the parliamentary elections taking place on April 10. While the country won acclaim for its low fatality rate during the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus now is on inefficiency, waste and skewed economic incentives in the healthcare system.
Renowned medical centres in Seoul are overwhelmed by patients, while the rest of the country struggles with a lack of physicians. A six-week-and-counting national walk-out by nearly 13,000 residents and interns protesting a plan to boost medical school enrolment has exacerbated the situation.
Mr Jung Seung-pyo, an esophageal cancer patient who lives on Jeju Island, flew to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for surgery in June 2023. While he is supposed to have check-ups every four weeks, sometimes it takes several months to get an appointment.
“There’s no doctor at all on this island who can treat esophageal cancer,” Mr Jung said of his hometown, which has a population of almost 700,000 people. “Everything is so concentrated in Seoul.”
South Korea has among the fewest doctors per capita of all developed countries and has not increased the number of medical students in more than two decades, said Mr Gaetan Lafortune, a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Demographic factors like the rapidly ageing population will exacerbate the scarcity, he said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has vowed to address the crisis. He proposed measures, like increasing the number of doctors, that have drawn complaints for being “populist moves” ahead of the election to select the 300-member National Assembly.
While his conservative People Power Party is currently in power, he is trying to flip dozens of seats held by his progressive rivals, led by the Democratic Party, to take control of the national legislature.
The healthcare system is “collapsing”, Mr Yoon said at a public hearing in February. “Now is the golden time to push reforms.”
Yet the doctors themselves oppose efforts to expand physician supply, arguing that the government’s proposal to increase medical school enrolment by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058 does not address the root problem.
This, they say, is that doctor pay in some critical fields covered by the country’s National Health Insurance system is far lower than that for outside specialists, especially those who do cosmetic and aesthetic procedures. The disparity in compensation and infrastructure between Seoul and rural areas also means a dearth of medical workers outside the capital.
“Doctors are disappearing at emergency centres, surgery rooms, delivery rooms, and hospitals in smaller cities,” said Prof Cheong in a December report. “Many young doctors gave up becoming fellows at medical colleges and work in the beauty industry.”
Cosmetic surgery has aggressively taken hold and medical tourism is booming in South Korea. More than 8 million foreign patients arrived between 2009 and 2022, many for the beauty industry that offers ubiquitous access to plastic surgery, Botox for US$6 (S$8) per shot, and laser skin tightening.
Meanwhile, essential fields including pediatrics have been hard hit. Only 53 residents applied to fill 205 paediatric slots for 2024, and just eight were outside Seoul and its surroundings, according to the health ministry. For paediatric surgery, two trainee doctors applied for spots outside of the greater Seoul area.",2024-04-07 23:15:00,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times,104,march 2023 17yearold girl fell building south city ambulance turned away three treat among 3750 since 2017 local provide care according report professor university startling statistic one become major issue parliamentary taking place 10 country acclaim low fatality rate covid19 pandemic focus inefficiency waste skewed economic medical rest country lack national walkout nearly 13000 plan boost medical school enrolment esophageal cancer patient island flew national university hospital surgery june 2023 supposed every four sometimes several get doctor island treat esophageal cancer said population almost 700000 people everything concentrated korea among per number medical two said senior economist economic development demographic like rapidly population exacerbate scarcity president vowed address crisis like increasing number drawn ahead election select 300member national conservative people power party currently power trying flip progressive led democratic party take control national system said public hearing golden time push oppose expand physician supply proposal increase medical school enrolment 2000 year current 3058 address root say doctor pay critical covered national health insurance system far lower outside especially cosmetic aesthetic disparity compensation infrastructure rural also dearth medical outside disappearing emergency surgery delivery smaller said prof report many young gave becoming medical work beauty surgery aggressively taken hold medical tourism booming south korea 8 million foreign 2009 2022 many beauty industry ubiquitous access plastic surgery us6 s8 per shot laser skin essential pediatrics hard hit 53 applied fill 205 2024 eight outside surroundings according health ministry surgery two trainee applied outside greater area doctor shortage fuel election angst south korea
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,105,South Korea launches second military spy satellite,"South Korea has successfully launched its second military spy satellite into orbit, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year.
The neighbouring countries each launched their first spy satellites last year – North Korea in November and South Korea in December — amid heightened animosities.

They said their satellites would boost their abilities to monitor each other and enhance their own missile attack capabilities.
South Korea’s second spy satellite was launched from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida on Sunday evening local time, which was Monday morning in Seoul.

South Korea’s Defence Ministry said the satellite entered orbit and communicated with an overseas ground station after separation from a rocket.

“With the success of the second military spy satellite launch, our military has acquired an additional independent surveillance ability and further bolstered our ‘kill chain’ capability,” Defence Ministry spokesperson Jeon Ha Gyu said in a statement, referring to the military’s pre-emptive missile strike capability.
Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,107,"China will amplify AI-generated content to sway public opinion in India & US, warns Microsoft","Voting for India’s 543 Lok Sabha seats is scheduled from 19 April to 4 June spread over seven phases, while legislative elections in South Korea and the US Presidential will be held on 10 April and 5 November, respectively.
Clint Watts, General Manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC), stated in a blog post Thursday, “With major elections taking place around the world this year, particularly in India, South Korea, and the United States, we assess that China will, at a minimum, create and amplify AI-generated content to benefit its interests.”
New Delhi: China will create and amplify AI-generated content to influence public opinion and further its geopolitical objectives with elections taking place around the world this year, particularly in India, South Korea and the United States, warned tech giant Microsoft.
The blog post by Watts also mentioned China’s intent to generate and promote AI-generated content to support its interests in these significant elections. The analysis was also highlighted in the latest East Asia report published Wednesday by the MTAC.
Although the current influence of such content on audience perspectives is limited, China’s ongoing exploration of enhancing memes, videos, and audio could potentially become more impactful in the future, according to the analysis.
These concerns come in the wake of reports of Chinese cyber and influence actors engaging in espionage and operations across various regions. These cyber actors have refined their methods, utilising AI-generated content to sow discord within the US and exacerbate tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, including Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, Watts highlighted in the blog post.
In the blog post titled China Tests US Voter Fault Lines and Ramps AI Content to Boost Its Geopolitical Interests, Watts discusses the specific topics where China has used AI-generated content to gauge voters’ mindsets ahead of elections.
These topics include the train derailment in Kentucky in November 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, the disposal of Japanese nuclear wastewater, drug use in the US as well as immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.
Watts also noted that during the Taiwanese presidential election in January, there was a notable increase in the utilisation of AI-generated content to enhance information operations by actors affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — marking the first time that Microsoft Threat Intelligence witnessed a nation-state actor using AI content in attempts to influence a foreign election.
Since at least February 2023, the group identified as Storm-1376 has significantly increased its use of AI-generated news anchors, the analysis highlighted.
It added that this tactic of using AI to alter videos has been previously deployed against the same dissident. Moreover, Storm-1376 launched a sequence of AI-generated memes targeting William Lai, the candidate of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the presidential race, illustrating a countdown to the DPP’s removal from authority, it said.
According to the analysis, however, there is limited evidence available regarding the potential impact of these developments on India’s election.

The West is in more danger than it has ever been in, the head of NATO said in a dire warning on Saturday as he warned of an ""alliance of authoritarian powers"" working against the West's democracies.
Jens Stoltenberg highlighted the ever-strengthening relations between Russia, Iran, China and North Korea as he warned that the world is ""more dangerous"" and ""much more unpredictable"" and ""violent"" than it ever has been in an interview with the BBC.
""China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and, in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg.

Russia is also providing technology to both Iran and North Korea in exchange for ammunition and military equipment, the NATO Secretary General noted, which is an incredibly dangerous trade amid the ongoing war in Ukraine sparked by a Russian invasion in February 2022 and the raging conflict in Gaza, sparked by Iranian-backed militant group Hamas' invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, which was followed by intense retaliation by Israel.

The US and its NATO allies are on the side of Israel and Ukraine, while Iran, Russia, North Korea and, to a lesser extent, China, are on the side of Russia and Hamas, though the Gaza conflict is more complicated than the one playing out in Ukraine.
Essentially, danger stems from the possibility of a NATO country becoming fully involved in a conflict that one of the so-called ""authoritarian"" countries have their hands in, as an all-out war could break out, becoming World War III.
(Image: KHAMENEI.IR/AFP via Getty Images)
That's what the US and its allies fear now after Israel launched a deadly airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, killing seven of the country's top officials as Iran vowed to seek revenge against not only Israel but also demanded the US be held responsible for the strike.
NATO is hoping to send a ""very clear message"" to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Stoltenberg said, as the bloc urges the country to do ""significantly more"" to reduce civilian casualties in the conflict.
(Image: AFP via Getty Images)
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have killed more than 33,000 people in the conflict so far, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry, and many of them have been women and children. The IDF's incessant bombing of hospitals and refugee camps in the region has led to mass casualties as dozens are killed in strikes that are meant to slay just one person.
The war in Ukraine is another story. The US and its NATO allies have been providing aid to the country as it wars with Russia — which is essentially what the treaty bloc was established for, to keep Russia at bay amid the Cold War decades ago.

Stoltenberg told the BBC that he's urging NATO and its allies to provide more funding to the region but that there's only so much NATO can do to help its ally, which he said will have to be OK with some ""compromises"".
A long-term funding deal is expected to be reached by members of the military alliance in July, he said as he tirelessly continues to lobby member states to fork up more money for the Ukrainian war effort. He wants to provide €100 billion (£86billion) to the country, but many countries, the US included, have been reluctant to contribute enough to meet that total.
He added: ""Even if we believe and hope that the war will end in the near future, we need to support Ukraine for many years, to build their defences to deter future aggression."" But Ukraine itself will need to chip in, too, he said.
Stoltenberg said NATO allies are working with other allied countries around the world, including Japan and South Korea, to stave off aggression from the ""stronger alliance of authoritarian powers"".

TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,109,South Korea’s Election Is About ‘Gladiator Politics’,"The elections are ostensibly about the 300 seats in Parliament, but when South Koreans go to the polls on Wednesday, they will also be signaling support for one of two leaders who are locked in what is known here as “gladiator politics.”
The do-or-die rivalry between President Yoon Suk Yeol and the opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds the majority in the National Assembly, has made the elections as fraught with fear and resentment as any in South Korea​n history. Neither leader commands broad popularity, instead relying on hard-line supporters who either want to see Mr. Yoon, a conservative, impeached for abuse of power, or Mr. Lee, a progressive, imprisoned for corruption.
“This election is about who you want to punish, Yoon Suk Yeol or Lee Jae-myung,” said Eom Kyeong-young, an election analyst at the Zeitgeist Institute in Seoul.
On the global stage, South Korea is the dynamic exporter of cars, phones, K-pop and K-dramas. But at home, voter discontent runs deep. The country’s economy is slowing. Its birthrate is the world’s lowest.

Photograph: Orlando Ramirez/Getty Images
Leona Maguire won through to the semi-finals of the T-Mobile Matchplay Championship at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas for a second straight year as she saw off Thailand’s Moriya Jutanugarn 4&3 on Saturday.
Maguire, who gained the number one ranking after topping the scoring after three rounds of strokeplay, was two up inside three holes, but Jutanugarn stole a hole back with a birdie four on the par-five fourth.
A par on the short fifth was enough for Maguire to regain her two-hole lead and it became three up after a birdie two on the eighth. Back-to-back pars on the 11th and 12th to Jutanugarn’s bogeys put Maguire five up with six to play.
Jutanugarn did enjoy one further success on the 14th with a par to Maguire’s bogey but a par at the next sealed victory for the Cavan golfer with three holes left to play.

Maguire will face Sei Young Kim in the semi-finals after the South Korean got the better of an out of sorts Rose Zhang by 6&5, the young American star seven over for the 13 holes of their match.
Nelly Korda’s sensational form continued with a 3&2 win over fellow American Angel Yin as she looks to make it four tournament wins in a row. She will now face South Korea’s Narin An in the last four after her one hole win over Japan’s Minami Katsu.
A third-round 69 for a total of six-under-par 210 gave Maguire a three-stroke margin over the trio of Zhang, Yin and Katsu following the strokeplay, but all those scores are binned headed into the matchplay element of the innovative tournament on the LPGA Tour.
Maguire described heading the qualifiers as a “big mental win” in difficult, windy conditions with firm greens, where her patience on shot execution stood to her.
“It was so challenging and swirly and the winds and stuff, you couldn’t really get too far ahead or focus on anything other than the shot at hand, which I think was quite nice. I personally didn’t watch the leaderboards. I know Dermot [Byrne] was keeping an eye on them if we needed to do something. I kind of leave that to him and was trying to hit as many good shots as I could,” explained Maguire of her own mindset in navigating a route into the knock-outs.
Maguire was third in last year’s event and has again felt very much at home in the desert: “I love this golf course. I think it’s one of the best, if not the best, golf course we play all year. It’s an unbelievable test. It’s really a Major championship golf course. You get punished if you hit bad shots and get rewarded if you hit good shots, and that’s exactly how golf should be I think. I really enjoy the test that it brings.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,114,"China, North Korea targeting elections in India, US? Microsoft warns of AI use, cryptocurrency heists","China is likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content to target elections in India, the US and South Korea, and understand issues that divide voters in these countries ahead of national elections, Microsoft warned on Friday.
In a blog post, Microsoft cited its report on 'Threat Intelligence insights' to explain how China ""is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favour.""
ALSO READ: US tech giants turn to Mexico to make AI gear, spurning China
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence insights in the latest East Asia report were published by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) on Friday.
The report said it is expected that ""Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors,"" will work toward targeting elections in ""India, South Korea, and the United States"".
How China, North Korea might influence elections in India, US, South Korea?
1. China's influence operation (IO) seeks perspectives on US political topics: China had allegedly begun using generative AI to create sleek and engaging visual content. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence continued to identify AI-generated memes targeting the US, it said.
The Microsoft report claimed that China increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world. The ""increased use"" of Chinese AI-generated content in recent months aims to ""influence and sow division"" in the US and elsewhere on a range of topics. Many of this topic included controversial domestic issues.
These topics include the train derailment in Kentucky in November 2023, the Maui wildfires in August 2023, the disposal of Japanese nuclear wastewater, drug use in the U.S. as well as immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.
The Microsoft analysis also mentioned the company's September 2023 report which highlighted how Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-affiliated social media accounts began posed as Americans across the political spectrum and responded to comments from authentic users.
2. North Korea cyber operations: The report mentioned that North Korea has increased its cryptocurrency heists and supply chain attacks to fund and further its military goals and intelligence collection.
""It has also begun to use AI to make its operations more effective and efficient,"" it added. This may facilitate the development of new military capabilities.
It added that North Korean threat actors are adapting to the age of AI. ""They are learning to use tools powered by AI large-language models (LLM) to make their operations more efficient and effective,"" the report said.
3. AI-generated contents and anchors: The Microsoft report mentions a picture in its report, claiming that it shows how Storm-1376 posted videos in Mandarin and English alleging that the United States and India were responsible for unrest in Myanmar.
""The same AI-generated anchor is used in some of these videos appeared in a Taiwan-facing Storm-1376 campaign,"" it said.
Will these tactics sway voters?
The report, however, claimed that there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion. ""While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will continue — and may prove effective down the line,"" the Microsoft report added.
China's AI influence in Taiwan election
According to the report, China did a test run in Taiwan using AI-generated content to influence voters away from a pro-sovereignty candidate.
On Taiwan’s election day, Storm-1376 had reportedly posted an AI-generated audio clips of Foxconn owner Terry Gou, an independent Party candidate in Taiwan’s presidential race, who bowed out of the contest in November 2023.
""The audio recordings portrayed Gou's voice endorsing another candidate in the presidential race. Gou’s voice in the recordings is likely AI generated, as Gou made no such statement,"" the report added.
The general or Lok Sabha Elections in India are due in April-May, while the presidential elections in the US will be held on November 5. The national elections in South Korea will be held on April 10.
Microsoft shared a timeline that showed how China used AI influence in Taiwan election.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,115,South Korean Party Pledges Access to US Bitcoin ETFs in Race for Votes,"(Bloomberg) -- Campaigning in South Korea’s parliamentary election has underlined the nation’s status as one of the world’s largest crypto markets, with both major political parties touting related inducements to win votes.
President Yoon Suk Yeol’s People Power Party has vowed to delay a digital-asset tax, while the opposition Democratic Party pledged to lift curbs on exchange-traded funds — including US Bitcoin products — that directly hold tokens.
“We’re going to allow the ETFs, whether domestic or overseas,"" Democratic Party policy specialist Hwanseok Choi said, citing its manifesto. Hwanseok, a member of the party’s think tank, participated in drawing up the manifesto.
Yoon is seeking to wrest control of the legislature in the April 10 poll from a progressive camp led by the Democratic Party. Official figures show that more than 6 million South Koreans — over 10% of the population — participated in the crypto market via registered exchanges in the first half of last year. That represents a sizable pool of potential voters in a pivotal election.
ETF Controversy
The US in January gave the green light for ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin, and the products have amassed total assets of about $57 billion so far. South Korea’s securities regulator quickly said brokering the products locally may violate the law, effectively choking a potential efflux of speculative cash.
The move stoked some confusion and roiled a slew of stocks. The People Power Party’s manifesto doesn’t dwell on the controversy, instead promising to delay planned taxes on crypto gains beyond the scheduled timeframe of 2025.
South Koreans have been active in the latest digital-asset bull market and are famed for their ardor for smaller cryptocurrencies, not just market-leader Bitcoin. Upbit, the biggest domestic crypto exchange, regularly ranks among the top platforms globally for trading volume.
Korea Securities Depository data show South Koreans last month poured more than $200 million into the shares of US-listed Bitcoin holder MicroStrategy Inc. They also flocked to US crypto-futures ETFs, which are permitted products.
Even election candidates have exposure: some 7% own crypto, according to a Yonhap report that analyzed asset disclosures.
Crypto Risks
The flip side of such speculative animus is that crypto is a highly risky sector — the nation infamously spawned Do Kwon and his doomed Luna and TerraUSD tokens, which blew up more than $40 billion when they imploded in 2022.
But memories of the wipeout, which impacted hundreds of thousands of people, are being overshadowed by this year’s $900 billion jump in the crypto market. A dedicated investor-protection framework comes into effect in July, and both parties have indicated they would also pursue wider regulation for the industry.
Along with the sops floated by politicians, that points to the possibility of greater acceptance of digital assets in South Korea, echoing a broader Asian trend. In contrast, many US officials are hostile to crypto.
Expectations are growing that spot-crypto ETFs will eventually be allowed, adding to the potential for the crypto market to be more “widely established as an investment asset"" in South Korea, Hanwha Investment & Securities Co.’s alternative asset analyst Yumin Kim wrote in a recent note.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,118,GIST Researchers Find the Link Between Human Activity and Shifting Weather Patterns in Western North America,"GWANGJU, South Korea, April 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Western North America seems to be experiencing more extreme weather events more frequently. From scorching droughts to torrential floods, the climate is changing rapidly, with no signs of slowing down. From 2011 to 2015, California and neighboring states experienced extended periods of drought, while 2017 saw heavy rains trigger catastrophic floods.
These events are linked to specific weather patterns. The atmosphere is like a network of interconnected pathways that determine how weather systems move and interact across the globe. In the Northern Hemisphere, there are three such major teleconnection patterns that affect winter conditions: the Pacific North American pattern (PNA), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the North American winter dipole (NAWD). However, the understanding of how these patterns change over time and their connection to climate change remains limited.
To better understand this phenomenon, a group of scientists led by Professor of Earth Sciences and Environmental Engineering Jin-Ho Yoon and including Ph.D. student Jueun Lee from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology recently conducted a study to examine the reasons behind changes in these patterns. Their findings have been published in npj Climate and Atmospheric Science on 7 March 2024.
The scientists employed a sophisticated Community Earth System model that there is a regular influence of the NAWD for over 70 years (1951-2020), which is in contrast with the fluctuating influence from PNA and minor impacts from NAO. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a strengthening negative correlation between the PNA and the NAWD: as one exhibits a positive phase, the other tends to exhibit a negative phase. “This projected intensification of large-scale atmospheric circulation in a warming climate is expected to likely escalate extreme hydroclimatic events in mid-latitude regions like California near western North America,” explains Dr. Yoon.
The weather system is like a network of dominos, where one piece can trigger a chain reaction and set off a series of unforeseen events. Using extensive models and numerical simulations, the scientists deduced that these changes in how the PNA and the NAWD interact can be traced back to variations in the jet stream, a band-like flow of air high up in the atmosphere. As the climate warms, the jet stream changes, influencing patterns such as the PNA and the NAWD.
The study notably shows that greenhouse gas emissions play a significant role in driving the shifts. “Climate models consider a range of factors affecting the atmosphere, including changes in greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities. By running simulations with and without the influence of greenhouse gases, we can compare the results and see how they differ,” explains Dr. Yoon. The scientists observed an association between higher greenhouse gas levels and the variations in the jet stream: the gases drive the northward drift of the Asia-Pacific jet core. Aided by mountain-related lifting over the Alaskan Range, contributing to the formation of potent high-pressure systems in the vicinity. This phenomenon strengthens the winter stationary wave throughout western North America.
Simply put, the study shows that the rise in temperatures caused by greenhouse gases is changing how air moves in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects the weather patterns that influence winter conditions in western North America and contribute to recent more frequent extreme weather events.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,119,"China plans to disrupt US elections using AI-generated content, Microsoft claims","wildpixel/Getty Images
The Chinese government is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts to disrupt elections around the world, Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Team has warned. Microsoft claims that a host of Chinese state-backed cyber criminal groups are planning to use AI to interfere with elections in 2024 in the US, India, and South Korea. The company's security experts added that North Korea is also participating in the effort, which could span a variety of channels, including social media.
""China is using fake social media accounts to poll voters on what divides them most to sow division and possibly influence the outcome of the US presidential election in its favor,"" Microsoft wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""China has also increased its use of AI-generated content to further its goals around the world.""
Also: How AI will fool voters in 2024 if we don't do something now
Microsoft added that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backs cybercriminal groups that, in recent months, have tried to divide Americans on a variety of recent events, including claiming that the US government may have been involved in the Kentucky train derailment in November 2023, that the US is intentionally poisoning foreign water supplies, the reasons for drug use in the US, as well as ""immigration policies and racial tensions in the country.""
At the same time, Microsoft, which has monitored the group's communications across channels, said that ""there is little evidence these efforts have been successful in swaying opinion.""
Governments across the globe have always used technology extensively to influence public opinion, and especially in the past decade. Soon after the 2016 US election, several reports suggested the Russian government was actively attempting to spread misinformation to sway US public opinion. Other reports have suggested that China, the US, and many other countries have similarly engaged in cyber techniques that aim to convince people around the globe to side with their initiatives.
However, as AI becomes more sophisticated, the risks of spreading misinformation only grow. With the ability to create fake images, videos, and other types of content, it's possible for governments and government-backed cyber criminal groups to target many more people with far more believable content.
According to Microsoft, North Korea's involvement in the efforts center not necessarily on swaying elections, but on generating revenue for the country. North Korea already engages in stealing cryptocurrency funds and attacking supply chain software.
""The United Nations estimates that North Korean cyber actors have stolen over $3 billion in cryptocurrency since 2017,"" Microsoft said. ""Heists totaling between $600 million and $1 billion occurred in 2023 alone.""
Also: Tech giants promise to combat fraudulent AI content in mega elections year
Looking ahead, Microsoft said that based on China's activities so far, the chances of the country impacting global elections remains low. However, that doesn't mean this couldn't change in the future.
""We assess that China will, at a minimum, create and amplify AI-generated content to benefit its interests,"" Microsoft said. ""Despite the chances of such content in affecting election results remaining low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will likely continue – and may prove more effective down the line.""",2024-04-05 13:29:00,https://www.zdnet.com,ZDNet,119,government ramping artificial intelligence disrupt around world threat intelligence team host criminal use ai interfere 2024 u south korea security added north korea also effort could span variety social fake social medium poll sow division possibly influence outcome u presidential election favor wrote post china also use content around ai fool 2024 dont something added communist party recent tried divide variety recent u government may involved train derailment 2023 u intentionally poisoning foreign water drug use u well immigration racial time across said little evidence successful swaying across globe always used technology extensively influence public opinion especially past decade soon 2016 u election several government actively spread misinformation sway u public opinion china u many similarly engaged aim convince people around globe side ai becomes sophisticated spreading misinformation grow ability create fake content possible criminal target many people far believable north involvement center necessarily swaying generating revenue country north korea already stealing fund supply chain united north stolen 3 billion since 2017 said 600 million 1 billion 2023 tech promise combat fraudulent ai content ahead said based far country global remains low however doesnt mean change ass china minimum create amplify content benefit said despite content affecting election low increasing experimentation audio likely continue may prove effective line china disrupt u content
TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,121,Early voting kicks off with heavy turnout in South Korea elections,"1 of 5 | Early voting began on Friday for next week's National Assembly election in South Korea, a contest widely seen as a referendum on the administration of current President Yoon Suk Yeol. Photo by Thomas Maresca/UPI
SEOUL, April 5 (UPI) -- South Korean voters turned out in record-setting numbers for early voting Friday ahead of next week's parliamentary elections, which are widely seen as a midterm referendum on the administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Voters began casting ballots at 3,565 polling stations nationwide in a two-day early voting period before the main vote on Wednesday for the 300-member National Assembly. Advertisement
When the polls closed at 6 p.m., some 6.91 million people, or 15.61% of eligible voters, had cast a ballot, according to the National Election Commission. It was the highest figure ever in early voting for a general election and well above the 12.04% turnout at the same time four years ago.
Yoon's People Power Party is aiming to take the majority in the National Assembly, which is currently dominated by the opposition Democratic Party.
In 2022, the conservative Yoon narrowly edged out his opponent Lee Jae-myung of the liberal Democratic Party by a razor-thin margin. A Democratic Party-led bloc has held 180 of the 300 seats in the National Assembly since 2020, however, severely hampering Yoon's domestic agenda.
Advertisement
A poll released last week by Gallup Korea showed the PPP with greater support than the Democratic Party, at 37% to 29%. But Yoon's party would need to flip more than 30 seats to take control of the parliament, widely considered a tall order.
That task is made more difficult as Yoon has been saddled with low approval ratings over his handling of a wide range of issues from sky-high housing prices and soaring food costs to concerns over the country's plunging birth rate, which is the lowest in the world.
Last week's Gallup Korea poll saw his support drop from a recent high of 39% to 34% ahead of the election.
Yoon has also been at the center of a standoff with striking trainee doctors that has dragged on since February, while his administration has been beset by corruption allegations, including a highly publicized scandal around First Lady Kim Keon Hee accepting the gift of a Dior bag.
Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is facing corruption challenges of his own and is currently facing trials over a range of charges including bribery.
Next week's result will play a large role in Yoon's ability to press ahead with his agenda over the remaining three years of his mandatory single five-year term.
Advertisement
On the domestic front, Yoon has long been aiming to push through economic reforms that include taking on labor unions and reducing regulations on businesses. He has had more success establishing his agenda on the foreign policy front, where Seoul has taken a harder line against North Korea and strengthened security cooperation with the United States and Japan.
Yoon cast his vote early Friday morning in Busan while on an official visit to the city.
Lee also voted early in the central city of Daejeon.
""In the end, it's up to the people to decide, and I would like to ask you to vote early today and tomorrow,"" Lee said. ""If you give up your sovereignty, if you give up your vote, all that you give up goes to a few vested interests.""
While South Korea's political landscape is dominated by the two main parties, a wild card this year is the rise of third parties in recent polls. The progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, led by disgraced former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, has emerged as the third most popular party and is drawing voters disillusioned with the status quo.
In the last Gallup Korea poll, the party -- which was only formed in February -- had 12% support, highlighting the possibility of gaining enough seats to play a spoiler role in the tightly contested parliament.

The Japanese leader speaks ahead of a planned summit next week with US President Joe Biden, as the allies look for ways to counter China's growing influence in Asia
TOKYO, Japan – Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Friday, April 5, said he wanted to cooperate with South Korea and the Philippines, allies shared with the US, and even engage with North Korea to promote regional security.
“The current security environment is tough and complex, and we are at a turning point in history,” Kishida said in a group interview. “Cooperation between Japan and the United States and like-minded countries is a very important issue,” he added.
The Japanese leader spoke ahead of a planned summit next week with US President Joe Biden, as the allies look for ways to counter China’s growing influence in Asia and deter it from resorting to military action to resolve its disputes in the region.
The state visit to Washington, the first by a Japanese leader in nine years, is meant to showcase their close security and economic ties, with the two leaders expected to discuss cooperation on defense equipment and a possible upgrade in the US military command structure in Japan.
That meeting will be followed by a trilateral summit with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
“Close cooperation between Japan, the US, and the Philippines is crucial for a free and open order based on the rule of law and for economic prosperity in the region,” Kishida said.
Japan last year delivered four air defense radars to the Philippines and is negotiating a reciprocal access agreement with Manila that would make it easier for Japanese troops to train there.
A separate trilateral meeting between Kishida, Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in the US last year helped Tokyo mend relations with Seoul and bolster security cooperation.
Kishida has said he is also willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim “without any preconditions” in a bid to improve strained relations with the nuclear-armed regime.
Relations between the countries have been strained over disputes dating back to Japan’s occupation in the first half of the 20th century, and by North Korea’s past abduction of Japanese citizens.
“Establishing a fruitful relationship will not only benefit Japan and North Korea but will also contribute greatly to peace and stability in the region,” Kishida said.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,124,She slept with a violin on her pillow in Korea. Her dreams came true in Italy,"CREMONA – When Ms Ayoung An was 8, her parents bought her a violin. She slept with the instrument on the pillow next to her every night.
Two years later, a shop selling musical instruments opened in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, her home town, and Ms An became a fixture there, pelting the owner with questions. “I think I bothered him a lot,” Ms An, now 32, said.
As a teenager, she decided she would become a violin-maker.
Eventually, a journey with twists and turns took her to Cremona in northern Italy – a famed hub for violin-makers, including masters like Antonio Stradivari, since the 16th century. There, Ms An, a rising star in the violin-making world with international awards under her belt, runs her own workshop.
Set on a quiet cobblestone street, Ms An’s studio is bathed in natural light and filled with books and piles of wood chunks that must air dry for five to 10 years before becoming instruments or risk warping. She shares the two-room studio with her husband, Mr Han Wangsoo, who’s also a violin-maker.
On a recent Monday, Ms An was hunched over a thick 20-inch piece of wood held in place by two metal clamps. Pressing her body down for leverage, she scraped the wood with a gouge, removing layers, her hands steady and firm. She was forming a curving neck called a “scroll”, one of the later steps of making a violin or cello. On this day, the violin-maker was immersed on a commission for a cello, which shares a similar crafting process.
Violins like Ms An’s, made in the tradition of Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri, require about two months of work and sell for about €16,000 (S$23,400) to €17,000.
“I can make a violin in three weeks, but I don’t want to,” Ms An said. “This object is very precious to the person purchasing it.”
Ms An was 17 when she hatched her plan to learn the craft: She would move in with an American family in a Chicago suburb so that she could attend a local high school, master English and eventually study at the Chicago School of Violin Making. There were no such schools in Korea at the time.
Her parents, distraught about her moving so far away to pursue an uncertain career path, tried to stop her.
“I didn’t eat for days,” Ms An said. Finally, they gave in. “When I said goodbye to my parents at the airport, they were crying,” she added. “I wasn’t. I was too excited.”
Two years after moving to Illinois, she discovered that one of the best-known schools for violin-makers, the International School of Violin Making, was actually in Cremona.

TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,125,"South Korea election issues: Green onions, striking doctors, an alleged sexist jab at a candidate","People pass by posters of candidates running for the upcoming parliamentary election in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, April 3, 2024. As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues. This represents a stark contrast from past elections, which were overshadowed by security and foreign policy issues like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)
SEOUL – Soaring prices for green onions and apples. Striking doctors. A politician's allegedly sexist jab at a female candidate. These are among the issues animating voters in South Korea this year.
As South Koreans prepare to vote for a new 300-member parliament next week, many are choosing their livelihoods and other domestic topics as their most important election issues, staying away from traditionally popular agendas like North Korean nuclear threats and the U.S. security commitment.

“I feel drawn to someone who talks about things that can be truly helpful to our neighborhoods,” said Kim Yun-ah, a 45-year-old Seoul officer worker. “I often don’t know when North Korea test-fired missiles.”
Experts say up to about 30% or 40% of South Korea’s 44 million voters are politically neutral and that who they end up supporting will likely determine the results of the April 10 elections.
A look at the upcoming South Korean elections and the issues affecting voters’ sentiments.
MODERATES
South Korea’s conservative-liberal divide is so stark that many voters likely have already determined who they'll vote for according to their party affiliation, rather than by looking at the policies of the candidates in their districts.
But the extreme polarization has led to an expansion of moderates who are fed up with partisan strife and who focus more on livelihoods issues such as prices, jobs and taxes, according to Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.
Choi estimated that roughly 30% of South Koreas are conservatives, another 30% liberals and the remaining 40% moderates. Other experts put the proportion of moderates at 30%.
“In a nutshell, even if conservatives and liberals intensely bicker over political issues, that won’t influence election results much,” Choi said. “The fate of an election is rather determined by the moderates who silently monitor livelihood issues and decide who to vote for.”
Some observers say liberal opposition parties could retain their majority status, making conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol — whose single five-year term ends in 2027 — an early lame duck. But others note many moderates are still undecided, so it’s too early to predict who would win.
Regardless of the electoral outcome, Yoon's major foreign policy agendas would remain unchanged, such as boosting security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan and taking a tough line on North Korea's nuclear program, experts say.
GREEN ONIONS
Yoon got more than he bargained for when he visited a Seoul grocery mall last month to promote government efforts to tame food prices but ended up inviting criticism by talking about the prices of green onions.
Looking at a bundle of green onions with a price tag of 875 won ($0.65) — a temporary discount price offered thanks to a government subsidy — Yoon said that “I’ve been to lots of markets, and I would say 875 won is a reasonable price.”
Meanwhile, the average retail prices of green onions has hovered around 3,000 to 4,000 won ($2.2 to 2.9) in past weeks, reaching some of the highest levels in recent years.
Yoon's throw-away comment has created a mini-crisis for his ruling People Power Party as candidates from the main liberal opposition Democratic Party have brought green onions to election rallies and accused Yoon of underestimating food prices and being out of touch of the reality.
It’s not just green onions. The prices of agricultural products during March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The prices of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980.
Kim Tae-hyung, a 55-year-old moderate liberal, said he's almost decided to vote for a liberal opposition candidate running in his constituency because he believes the Yoon government hasn't done well on economy issues.
But he said Yoon doesn't deserve criticism over his green onion remarks. “Even if he doesn't know the price of green onions, I don't think it matters much as I also didn't know about it,"" Kim said.
STRIKING DOCTORS
The weekslong strikes by thousands of doctors is another headache for Yoon's party.
The doctors, all medical interns and residents, are protesting against Yoon's push to increase the yearly medical school admission cap by two thirds to create more doctors. They say universities can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that would undermine the country's future medical services, though critics say they simply worry about lower income in the wake of the supply of more doctors.
South Korea has one of the world's fastest-aging populations and its doctors-to-population ratio is among the lowest in the developed world. But efforts to add seats at medical schools is a politically risky project that past governments had already failed to achieve because of similar vehement protests by incumbent doctors and medical students.
Yoon initially enjoyed a rising approval rating over his recruitment plan, but now faces growing calls for a compromise as the doctors' strikes have caused numerous cancelled surgeries at hospitals and other inconveniences for patients.
“We absolutely need to raise the medical school quota. But the government is pushing for its increase in a too steep, abrupt manner that has surprised everyone,” said Lee Chul-seung, a liberal Seoul citizen in his mid-50s.
TOXIC RHETORIC
Fueled by contempt for the other side, the rival parties have spewed highly offensive, abusive language against each other.
When Lee Jae-myung, the Democratic Party chairman, criticized senior ruling party candidate Na Kyung-won over her alleged pro-Japanese views, he called her “nabe,” a combination of parts of the names of Na and late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon quickly called Lee's comments ""extreme misogyny."" Nabe in Japanese means pot, whose Korean translation is “naembi"" that can be used as a derogatory slang term to refer to a woman with many sex partners. Last month, supporters of Na's liberal rival candidate reportedly spread on social media a poster with a message saying “naembi tastes best when it's trampled on.""
Han labelled Lee's past comments as “trash,” drawing rebukes from Lee's party spokesperson who described “Han's mouth” “as ”trash bin.""
Also roiling the South Korean election race is former liberal justice minister Cho Kuk, whose newly launched small party is forecast by surveys to win 10-15 seats. Cho was once a rising political star during the government of Yoon's liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, until he faced a slew of scandals that hurt his reformist image and sharply split the nation.
Han called Cho “a shameless petty criminal.” Cho said Han, Yoon and Yoon's wife and first lady Kim Keon Hee “representative people of a criminal group.”",2024-04-05 04:13:47,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit,125,people pas running upcoming parliamentary election south korea 3 2024 south prepare vote new 300member parliament next week many choosing domestic important election stark contrast past security foreign policy like north nuclear u security soaring green striking allegedly jab female candidate among animating south korea south prepare vote new 300member parliament next week many choosing domestic important election away traditionally popular like north nuclear u security feel drawn someone truly helpful said kim 45yearold officer worker often dont know north korea say 30 40 south 44 million politically neutral end supporting likely determine 10 look upcoming south affecting divide stark many likely already determined theyll vote according party affiliation rather looking extreme polarization led expansion fed partisan strife focus according director institute presidential roughly 30 south another 30 40 put proportion 30in nutshell even intensely bicker political wont influence election much said fate election rather determined silently monitor livelihood decide vote say liberal opposition could retain majority status making conservative president whose single term 2027 early lame duck note many still undecided early predict would electoral outcome major foreign policy would remain unchanged security u japan taking tough line north nuclear program got grocery mall last month promote government tame food ended inviting criticism talking green bundle green price tag 875 065 temporary discount price thanks government subsidy said lot would say 875 reasonable average retail green around 3000 4000 22 29 past reaching highest recent throwaway comment ruling people power party main liberal opposition democratic party brought green election accused food touch green agricultural march 20 month last year nearly 90 marking since 1980kim 55yearold moderate liberal said almost decided vote liberal opposition candidate running constituency government done well economy said doesnt deserve criticism green onion even doesnt know price green dont think much also didnt know kim another headache medical push increase yearly medical school admission cap two create say cant handle steep increase would undermine future medical though say simply worry lower income wake supply korea one ratio among world add medical politically risky project past already achieve similar vehement incumbent medical initially rising approval rating recruitment plan growing compromise numerous absolutely need raise medical school quota government pushing increase steep abrupt manner everyone said lee liberal citizen mid50stoxic contempt side rival highly offensive abusive language lee democratic party chairman senior ruling party candidate na combination na late prime minister party leader han quickly lee extreme misogyny pot whose translation used derogatory slang term refer woman many sex last month liberal rival candidate reportedly spread social medium poster message saying best lee past trash drawing lee party mouth trash south election race former liberal justice minister cho whose newly small party forecast win 1015 cho rising political star government liberal predecessor moon faced slew hurt reformist image sharply split cho shameless petty criminal cho said han wife first lady kim representative people criminal group south korea election green striking jab candidate
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,126,"China will use AI to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India, Microsoft warns","China will attempt to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India this year with artificial intelligence-generated content after making a dry run with the presidential poll in Taiwan, Microsoft has warned.
The US tech firm said it expected Chinese state-backed cyber groups to target high-profile elections in 2024, with North Korea also involved, according to a report by the company’s threat intelligence team published on Friday.
“As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections,” the report reads.
Microsoft said that “at a minimum” China will create and distribute through social media AI-generated content that “benefits their positions in these high-profile elections”.
The company added that the impact of AI-made content was minor but warned that could change.
“While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft.
Microsoft said in the report that China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January. The company said this was the first time it had seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election.
A Beijing-backed group called Storm 1376, also known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, was highly active during the Taiwanese election. Its attempts to influence the election included posting fake audio on YouTube of the election candidate Terry Gou – who had bowed out in November – endorsing another candidate. Microsoft said the clip was “likely AI generated”. YouTube removed the content before it reached many users.
The Beijing-backed group pushed a series of AI-generated memes about the ultimately successful candidate, William Lai – a pro-sovereignty candidate opposed by Beijing – that levelled baseless claims against Lai accusing him of embezzling state funds. There was also an increased use of AI-generated TV news anchors, a tactic that has also been used by Iran, with the “anchor” making unsubstantiated claims about Lai’s private life including fathering illegitimate children.
Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut tool, which is developed by Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok.
Microsoft added that Chinese groups continue to mount influence campaigns in the US. It said Beijing-backed actors are using social media accounts to pose “divisive questions” and attempt to understand issues dividing US voters.
“This could be to gather intelligence and precision on key voting demographics ahead of the US Presidential election,” said Microsoft in a blog post accompanying the report.
One post on X, formerly Twitter, referred to a $118bn bipartisan bill in the US that combined a $20bn of investment in the US-Mexico border with a $75bn package for Ukraine and Israel. It asked: “What’s your reaction?” Another flagged the loss of an F-35 fighter in South Carolina last year, saying “only under the Biden administration” could a valuable piece of military hardware be lost – although debris was found soon after – and asked “what do you think about this?”
The report was published in the same week that a White House-appointed official review board said “a cascade of errors” by Microsoft let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior US officials. Last month, the US and UK governments accused China-backed hackers of waging a years-long cyber campaign targeting politicians, journalists and businesses, as well as the UK’s election watchdog.",2024-04-05 04:00:04,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian,126,china attempt disrupt u south korea year artificial content making dry run presidential poll u tech firm said target 2024 north korea also involved according report threat intelligence team south korea united head likely see influence extent north work toward report said minimum china create distribute social medium content company added impact content minor could impact content swaying remains low increasing experimentation audio continue may prove effective line said said report china already campaign presidential election company said first time seen entity content bid influence foreign group storm 1376 also known highly active election influence election included posting fake audio election candidate terry bowed another candidate said clip likely ai removed content many group series ultimately successful candidate lai candidate opposed baseless lai state fund also use news tactic also used anchor making unsubstantiated private life illegitimate said news tool company owner added continue mount influence u said social medium pose divisive attempt understand dividing u could gather intelligence precision key voting ahead u presidential election said post post x formerly twitter 118bn bipartisan bill u combined 20bn investment border 75bn package whats reaction another loss f35 fighter south last year saying administration could valuable piece military hardware lost although debris found soon think report week white official review board said cascade let break senior u last month u accused campaign well election watchdog china use ai disrupt u south korea
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,127,Naver CEO to fight against U.S. Big Tech in AI arms race,"Internet firm Naver has earned its nickname—Korea’s Google—by pulling off an improbable feat: It dominates South Korea’s search market, having defended its turf from Google, the world’s top search engine, whose revenue is 40 times as large as Naver’s.
As of September 2023, Naver controlled 59% of Korea’s search market to Google’s 31%.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon,” says Choi Soo-yeon, Naver’s CEO since 2022.
Naver is hardly a household name outside Korea. But it operates a sprawling portfolio that pits the $22-billion-in-market-cap firm against other Big Tech giants on multiple fronts.
It has a controlling stake in both Yahoo Japan—the most popular website in Japan, according to Nielsen—and the Japanese messaging app Line—a WhatsApp rival—through a joint venture with SoftBank.
It runs Korea’s No. 2 e-commerce service, behind Coupang. (Amazon’s platform ranks fourth.) Naver’s $1.2 billion purchase last year of Poshmark, the U.S.-based clothing-resale site, expanded its retail reach.
In the streaming wars era, Naver has amassed content platforms of its own. It owns Webtoon, which hosts mobile-friendly comic strips that are popular across Asia. (Naver is reportedly planning a U.S. IPO for Webtoon later this year.) Naver bought Wattpad, a Canada-based platform for user-submitted fiction, for $600 million in 2021.
Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon.” Choi Soo-yeon, Naver CEO
Naver also has a small but growing cloud-computing business—a category in which Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reign supreme—and it’s launched a series of AI projects to contend with the release of OpenAI’s viral chatbot, ChatGPT.
In recent quarters, Naver’s many business lines have notched record revenues and operating profits, but Choi sees Naver’s mission as extending beyond its own bottom line.
Despite Naver’s small size, she casts the firm as a counterpoint in a global tech scene in which power is concentrated among a gargantuan few.
“It’s becoming a world where there are only one or two search companies and one or two commerce companies,” Choi said in a recent wide-ranging interview—her first with the international press—at Naver headquarters in Seongnam, just outside Seoul. (Choi gave her answers in Korean, which were later translated into English.) Naver “is a company that constantly fights against such a world and strives to preserve diversity,” she says.
Investors question whether Naver can go toe-to-toe with cash-rich rivals. Still, Choi’s goal is ambitious—perhaps even noble—and belies the role she was appointed to fill: that of a caretaker CEO brought on to steady a company in turmoil.
Choi, 42, was an unconventional pick to run the company. A Harvard-educated M&A lawyer, she joined Naver in 2019 as head of global business support to help lead the firm’s expansion. Three years later, the board named Choi as CEO to show it was prepared to overhaul its culture after a series of crises.
In May 2021, a senior Naver developer died by suicide after accusing the company of fostering a toxic work culture. A labor union probe found he’d been bullied by executives for years. A later government survey found that over half of employees felt they were bullied at least once in a six-month period.
In the aftermath, Naver said “there were some acts of workplace harassment by some executives.” Choi’s predecessor as CEO, Han Seong-sook, stepped down, as did Naver’s COO, and Naver tapped Choi. At the time, she told shareholders her most urgent task was “to recover Naver’s corporate culture based on trust and autonomy.”
But a second tragedy struck early in Choi’s tenure. In September 2022, another employee died by suicide while on maternity leave, local media reported. Months later, her family claimed she’d been mistreated at work. A Naver internal investigation did not uncover evidence of harassment, and Korea’s labor ministry could not confirm the family’s claims, a company spokesperson said.
South Korea has the highest rate of suicide of all Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and South Koreans work 200 hours more per year than the global average.
“There was a lack of trust in the systems, leadership, and board,” Choi says of Naver’s previous culture. One big change Choi made was to reintroduce remote work, a rarity in post-COVID South Korea. The option gives employees “the choice of what kind of working environment they can be most productive and create the most innovation in.”
The suicides were the biggest scandal to rock Naver in its 25-year history. Naver launched in 1999, when founder Lee Hae-jin turned an internal Samsung project into an independent company. By the mid-2000s, Naver had passed rivals like web portal Daum to dominate Korea’s search market.
Naver and fellow internet firm Kakao (founded by an ex-Naver executive) have made South Korea one of a handful of countries where homegrown search engines outperform U.S. search giants without government intervention.
Naver got a head start on tailoring a search engine that met the tastes of the South Korean market, says Bokyung Suh, a Korea analyst at Bernstein Research. Naver hooked users early with its busy homepage that was heavy on icons, links, and animations. Google launched a bare-bones search engine in Korean in 2000, but it didn’t catch on. Google updated its site to a feature-rich format six years later.
Naver earned 9.6 trillion won ($7.41 billion) in revenue in 2023, a record. Search and e-commerce generated 37% and 26% of sales, respectively. It made $1.3 billion in operating profit, also a record.
Yet shares are currently trading about 60% below a COVID-era high. Investors are concerned about slowing revenue from search (up 0.6% in 2023), plummeting revenue from display ads (down 10% last year), and the lack of a “punchy, clear growth strategy,” Suh says.
Naver’s lack of a punchy, clear growth strategy is especially worrisome in the AI age, when Naver faces U.S. companies that are investing billions in the technology.
As U.S. giants dominate English-based AI, Naver may be able to establish an edge in systems based in Korean and other languages, Choi says.
Naver has a chatbot, CLOVA X, and an AI-powered search engine, Cue. Both are built on its Korean-language large-language model, HyperCLOVA X, which outperforms OpenAI’s GPT in Korean, recent studies say. Naver has claimed that HyperCLOVA, an earlier version of its model, was trained on 6,500 times as much Korean data as GPT-3.0, which underpins OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Naver is also partnering with Saudi Aramco on an Arabic large-language model.
Choi is especially interested in what she calls “sovereign AI,” or a model that’s tailored to an individual user. “We focus on what companies and governments that want to use AI would want, and what needs Big Tech can’t fulfill,” she says. As AI becomes more common, “each group will need an AI model that best understands” its unique traits.

Much like her rivals at Google and Microsoft, Choi is also grappling with how to integrate AI—with its penchant to hallucinate false information—into Naver’s search product. “People need accurate information through search,” she says, though she hopes AI’s tendency to make stuff up will become “nearly negligible in the near future.”
At the same time, she also sees room for a traditional search engine—with its list of links to choose from—amid the generative AI revolution. “Not all questions in the world have a single correct answer,” she says. “There is still a need for exploration.”
Naver’s base in South Korea, a chip powerhouse, is an advantage in the AI race, especially its homegrown manufacturers “that support the Korean language,” Choi says. Naver’s chip partners include Korea’s Samsung and the U.S.’s Intel.
“It’s not healthy to rely on just one company,” Choi says. Is that a coded reference to Nvidia? Yes, she says in English, with a smile.
Just four of South Korea’s top 100 firms by revenue had women CEOs last year, according to global headhunter UnicoSearch. Just 6% of executives at the companies were women.
Choi, whose CEO contract expires in 2025, expresses some unease at often being a “sole woman” in business: “Simply because I am a woman, there are expectations for me to demonstrate skills such as effective communication, adept conflict resolution, and the ability to nurture people.”
Korea’s internet sector got a little more diverse when Kakao appointed its first female CEO, Shina Chung, in March.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,128,I'm adopted and wasn't interested in exploring my South Korean heritage. That changed in 2020,"Everyone in my life knows me as Luke, but for the first six months of my life I was Choi, Jeong Hyuk.
My adoption records state that my name means Truth and Glory.
Earlier this year I travelled to South Korea, where I was born, for the first time as an adult.
During my first few days in Seoul and then Daegu, the city of my birth, a sense of home would hit me in waves, affecting all of my senses. It was the taste of the food, the colour palette of winter — even the smell of open sewer vents early in the morning was strangely comforting.
I experienced it while sitting on the subway too, which was unexpected and moving, because I haven't had a sense of home for a long time.
In addition to growing up as a South Korean adoptee in Australia in the 1980s and 90s, my childhood home in lutruwita/Tasmania was completely destroyed by fire in 2005.
A sense of ""home"" that affected all of my senses hit me in waves over the course of my first week in Seoul. ( )
By my second week in Korea, this feeling of home was constant. I mentioned this to someone I met in a museum and their response was one of the most profound parts of the trip.
""Of course,"" I remember them saying. ""Everything in this country has been designed for you by people like you"".
A long journey home that started in lockdown
Luke Bowden in Daegu, the South Korean city where he was born. ( )
I grew up with little to no interest in connecting with my South Korean heritage, instead wanting as much as possible to be 'Australian'.
Something changed in 2020 and I became curious about my birth family and past. I decided to reach out to a high-school friend, who is also an adoptee from South Korea, and asked for her advice on how I might find out more.
The search for my biological parents took years and involved DNA databases and petitions from the Tasmanian government to the adoption agency in Seoul on my behalf.
In mid-2022, the agency contacted my biological mother, who is now married. She denied being pregnant or having a baby and requested no further contact.
South Korea is quite conservative in comparison to Australia, and the assumption is her now-husband would be unaware she had a child before meeting him. Therefore, her only course of action would be denial.
I remember the day the woman from the Tasmanian government called with this news. I was at work and she asked if there was somewhere quiet I could go.
Unconsciously, I asked if it was good news, and quickly learnt it was the opposite.
I was acutely upset about my birth mother's response, with rejection and abandonment being such an inherent trigger.
When I mentioned this to a mental health professional weeks later, she shared something I initially dismissed.
""You've got closure on this now, Luke,"" she said.
""You've found the mother and now you can go and forge your own identity"".
Following my own footsteps
The adoption agency is the only place in Seoul is the only place in South Korea I knew I had been to before. ( )
Towards the end of my trip to Korea, I visited the adoption agency where my adoptive parents collected me in 1985.
As the elevator opened on the fourth floor I was greeted by two toddlers running around my legs.
A staff member gave me a tour of the building, explaining how much has changed within the building, with only the foyer remaining in its original state.
As we chatted at the building's entrance I couldn't take my eyes off the steps, consumed by the thought of my adoptive parents walking down them and onto the streets of Seoul with me in their arms.
With little information about my life before coming to Australia, the adoption agency is the only place in South Korea that I know I've been before.
My trip was coming to an end and the same friend who helped me begin the search for my family, organised a meeting with Professor Lee, Keun-Su, a former police officer who now locates missing people and works to reunite families.
With the assistance of a translator, Professor Lee said he might be able to find more information about my biological parents.
After our brief meeting, I was preparing to start my long journey home when Professor Lee invited me to join him on a radio show where he was due to do an interview.
It was last minute but I work in the media, so agreed. I was also purposefully being very spontaneous on this trip.
A message for my biological parents
The radio host and Professor Lee explained that they would ask me to introduce myself and explain what I was doing in South Korea. After this, they continued the program in Korean as I sat silently in the studio.
While I don't understand or speak Korean, I do know my biological parents' names, so it was a surprise to hear Professor Lee say their names and the province my records say they come from.
I realised he was doing a national call-out live on air for my birth parents.
Before I made this trip, many people asked if I was going to be looking for my family. It was never on my agenda because I already had closure.
It wasn't until the end of my time in Korea that I realised what the whole trip had been about: I was following Choi, Jeong Hyuk's footsteps — my own.
Back in the radio studio, Professor Lee pushed his phone towards my microphone, using a translation app to ask, ""what would you like to say to your parents?""
""I would like to tell them I have had a good life in Australia and to thank them very much for letting me be adopted. That I am well. That I am healthy and that I understand.""

FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,129,Corporate Reforms at Risk From Opposition Win in Korea Election,"(Bloomberg) -- South Koreans head to the polls next week to elect a new parliament and the outcome may threaten the government’s Japan-like corporate reforms that have helped spur a stock market rally.
The results of the April 10 vote to select the 300 members of the National Assembly could undermine President Yoon Suk Yeol’s flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the “Corporate Value-Up"" program, along with a number of his other reform measures.
Stocks and the won have already started to retreat in recent weeks amid concern the left-wing opposition will score a major victory over Yoon’s ruling party. An opposition victory already appears the most likely outcome. The odds of the ruling party gaining a majority in the vote is just 20%, according to economists at Citibank Korea.
“I plan to wait and see the results of the elections"" before buying, said Jae Lee, chief investment officer at Timefolio Asset Management SG Pvt in Singapore. “It’s not too late to pick stocks after confirming that the government and the regulators show strong commitment to the reform"" following the election, he said.
President Yoon, who took office in 2022, is aiming to replicate Japan’s success with corporate reforms that have propelled its stocks to record highs. His plan is to offer tax incentives to encourage listed firms to improve their valuations, a measure that requires parliamentary approval. The Value-Up program has already helped lure record quarterly foreign inflows to Korean stocks, which have also supported the won.
Here are some areas traders will be watching as the election takes place:
1. ‘Value-up’ and Tax Cuts
A key plank of the Value-Up program is to provide tax incentives for those firms that put in place measures to enhance shareholder returns. Levies that may be cut include dividend income tax, corporate tax, and inheritance tax.
That agenda may face increasing resistance if the opposition wins big.
“A left-wing dominant National Assembly could be less cooperative on tax incentives"" for the Value-Up program as they are likely to be deemed as a tax cut for the wealthy, Citibank economists including Jinwook Kim in Seoul wrote in an April 1 report.
Without the tax incentives, the Corporate Value-Up program would lack much of the driving force that is necessary to make it successful, Bank of America economists wrote in a research note last week.
2. Fate of the Capital Gains Tax
Another of Yoon’s policies that may be imperiled in the election is the president’s desire to abolish the planned capital gains tax on income from financial investments.
Yoon in January pledged to scrap the planned tax — which is set to be introduced next year — in a bid to boost investor sentiment and stock values.
The government had earlier agreed to delay the planned tax by two years from its original 2023 implementation date. The proposal would impose a levy of at least 20% on income from investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds if annual capital gains from them exceeds 50 million won ($37,000).
The main opposition Democratic Party wants to push ahead and introduce the tax.
3. Currency Market Reforms
Yoon’s government is also seeking to extend trading hours for the onshore won as part of efforts to improve investors’ access to the local market — a move that could help get Korean bonds and stocks included in more global indexes and thereby encourage greater foreign inflows.
Pilot tests are being conducted ahead of the official extension of the won’s trading hours slated for July.
Some analysts say one of the key things to watch for after the election will be how the new parliament perceives these reforms.
“For me and the market, the most important thing is the government’s resolve to push forward with the market reforms and FX liberalization,"" said Wee Khoon Chong, senior Asia Pacific market strategist at BNY Mellon in Hong Kong.
4. Buy Election Volatility
The uncertainty surrounding the election is expected to increase volatility, but it may also provide a buying opportunity, some investors say.
A decisive left-wing victory may see a pullback in stocks, especially those that have seen big gains on expectations for the “Value-up"" program.
If stocks fall, there are a “large number of investors with the belief that the Value-Up program will continue, with or without legislative support, and willing to buy into weakness,"" Bank of America analysts including Joon-Ho Lee and Jeehoon Park wrote in an April 1 research report.
Peter Kim of KB Securities Co. agrees.
An election win by the opposition should not scare away investors or change the long-term direction that the Korean government is trying to take, said Kim, Seoul-based head of global markets at KB.
Possible weakness in the won after the election may also be seen as a buying opportunity.
Any election shock is likely to be short-lived, BNY Mellon’s Chong said. “I like the won the most"" out of all emerging Asian currencies in the second quarter as it’s expected to be supported by “strong foreign inflows and tech export recovery,"" he said.
South Korea’s stock market will be shut April 10 for the election, and resume trading the following day. There has not been any announcement yet on any close for the currency market.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,132,"Hualien, Taiwan earthquake: Toll on Taiwan’s chip industry","When a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit Taiwan’s eastern coast on April 3, the first concern involved the risk to people and property. Here, the news was not as dire as initially feared — only nine people have been reported killed as of Wednesday evening, along with hundreds of injuries. Considering that Wednesday’s quake was the strongest in Taiwan in 25 years — and that earthquakes of similar strength have killed tens of thousands of people or more in other countries — this could have been much worse.
Taiwan was largely able to withstand such a powerful quake because the island has taken earthquake preparation seriously, strengthening its building codes after past disasters and drilling its population in how to respond. The newest buildings tended to fare best — the 1,670-foot Taipei 101, the island’s tallest building and designed to dampen shaking in a quake, barely moved.
There was one other way in which Taiwan — and the world — avoided a worse outcome from the earthquake: the island’s all-important semiconductor manufacturing industry seemed to emerge largely intact. That’s good news — but it’s also a reminder of how fragile some of the most important nodes of the global economy remain.
The world’s computers can’t run without Taiwan
To say that Taiwan is important to the global tech industry is like saying oxygen is important to breathing. Taiwan as a whole is responsible for making 80 to 90 percent of the world’s most advanced computer chips — ones for which there is no current substitute. Taiwan’s TSMC makes up half of that production on its own, and 90 percent of the chips TSMC makes are produced in its 12 fabrication plants — or “fabs” — on the island.
Fortunately, all of those fabs are on the western side of the island, away from the epicenter of the April 3 quake. Even a slight vibration, though, is enough to throw off the highly sensitive work of semiconductor manufacturing, and some machinery was halted or even damaged. But TSMC reported that production was getting back to normal within a few hours of the quake.
Again, preparation made a difference — TSMC has invested heavily in earthquake resilience in its fabs, which the company says are designed well beyond code.
But part of the reason that Taiwan has made itself so resilient to earthquakes is that it has a long history of … earthquakes. The island sits on the Ring of Fire, which is the unusually cool name for the 25,000-mile long belt of volcanoes and earthquakes that surround the Pacific Ocean. As a result, Taiwan experiences around a thousand earthquakes per year that are strong enough to be felt, and many more that aren’t. And just last year Taipei discovered an actual active volcano within its city limits.
After a 1999 earthquake that did more damage to Taiwan’s chip-building infrastructure, the electronics industry was disrupted for weeks — and that was at a time when tech and computer chips were far less important to the global economy than they are today, when chips are found in everything from cars to refrigerators. A Credit Suisse analysis found that if TSMC’s operations were to be somehow shut down — perhaps by an even more massive quake — manufacturing across the global economy would be severely disrupted.
And, of course, earthquakes and volcanoes are just one threat to Taiwan’s semiconductor foundries. The better known one is just 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait, where the People’s Republic of China has made it increasingly clear that it could be willing to use military power to force reunification with what it regards as a renegade province. Should Taiwan’s chip foundries be destroyed in such a conflict, the damage to the global economy could be on par with the Great Depression.
The fragile points of global tech
Is it the safest thing in the world to concentrate production of perhaps the single most important manufactured component of the global economy on one island that faces existential threats of both the seismic and geopolitical varieties (plus the occasional typhoon)? Not really.
But Taiwan is hardly the only critical node in tech manufacturing that happens to be located in a risky part of the world.
South Korea is maybe the second-most important location for semiconductor fabrication after Taiwan, with a 60 percent market share of the memory chips used in PCs and smartphones, and is the home of the major global tech player Samsung. South Korea also abuts North Korea, a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator who appears to be increasingly flirting with the possibility of war on the Korean peninsula. It’s also at risk from storms and flooding, though at least its tectonics are fairly stable. (Maybe?)
How about Japan? It’s no longer the dominant player it was in the go-go 1980s, though the government has spent billions to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the country, and it now has about 10 percent of the global market. Japan is also one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth — it’s at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and typhoons. And should a war with either North Korea or with China over Taiwan come to pass, Japan will surely be on the front line.
The US? Well, America hasn’t been a semiconductor hub in quite some time, though the Biden administration is trying its best to change that (with mixed success). But it’s worth noting that the intellectual nerve center of global tech, the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, sits on several major fault lines, including the San Andreas Fault. A major earthquake is a matter of when, not if.
Would it be better if more global tech manufacturing was concentrated in a safer place — like Syracuse, New York, perhaps the safest city in the US according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Risk Index? Sure. But that’s highly unlikely to happen.
The reality is that something as incredibly complex as the global tech manufacturing supply chain is inherently going to be fragile. The best we might be able to hope for is that the areas where we have concentrated that vulnerability take every step they can to prepare for that risk. Taiwan — at least when it comes to earthquakes — has done that.",2024-04-04 13:00:00,https://www.vox.com,Vox.com,132,74magnitude earthquake hit eastern coast 3 first concern involved risk people property news dire initially feared nine people evening along considering quake 25 similar strength people could much largely able withstand powerful quake island taken earthquake preparation seriously strengthening building past drilling population respond fare best 1670foot 101 building designed dampen shaking quake barely one way world worse outcome earthquake semiconductor industry emerge largely intact thats good news also reminder fragile important global economy cant run without say important global tech industry like saying oxygen important breathing whole responsible making 80 90 percent advanced computer chip current substitute half production 90 percent chip produced 12 fabrication western side island away epicenter 3 quake even slight vibration though enough throw highly sensitive work semiconductor machinery even production getting back normal within preparation made difference heavily earthquake resilience company designed well beyond part reason made resilient long history … island ring fire unusually cool name 25000mile long belt surround pacific ocean result around thousand per year strong enough felt many arent last year discovered actual active volcano within city 1999 earthquake damage infrastructure electronics industry time tech computer chip far le important global economy today chip found everything credit analysis found somehow shut perhaps even massive quake across global economy would severely course one threat semiconductor better known one 80 across strait republic china made increasingly clear could willing use military power force reunification renegade province chip conflict damage global economy could par great fragile global thing world concentrate production perhaps single important component global economy one island existential seismic geopolitical plus occasional typhoon hardly critical node tech risky part korea maybe important location semiconductor fabrication 60 percent market share memory chip used home major global tech player south korea also north korea state run dictator increasingly flirting possibility war peninsula also risk flooding though least tectonics fairly stable japan longer dominant player gogo 1980s though government spent bring semiconductor back country 10 percent global market japan also one earth risk war either north korea china come pas japan surely front u well semiconductor hub quite time though administration trying best change mixed success worth intellectual nerve center global tech bay area silicon valley several major fault san fault major earthquake matter better global tech concentrated place like new york perhaps city u according federal emergency management national risk index sure thats highly unlikely reality something incredibly complex global tech supply chain inherently going fragile best might able hope concentrated vulnerability take every step prepare risk least come done earthquake toll chip industry
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,133,A Photographer Flew His Drone into North Korea,"A photographer flew his drone into North Korea and captured fascinating images of the secretive country.
In a post published on March 28, Redditor XiaoHao2 shared a series of rare photos that he took after allegedly sending is drone into North Korea from Dandong, China in 2020.
“Drone pics of North Korea, I was in China, my drone flew across the border,” XiaoHao2 captions the Reddit post that has been upvoted 141,000 times.
The photographer, who hopes to remain anonymous on Reddit, says that his DJI drone captured images and video clips of the northwestern border city of Sinuiju in North Korea.
Sinuiju, which is the fourth biggest city in North Korea, faces the city of Dandong in China across the Yalu River, also known as the Amnok River.
According to XiaoHao2, the drone images were taken around 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) across the North Korean-China border.
The photographer says it is currently illegal to fly drones into Korea: “Now it’s geofenced, but this was taken in 2020.”
However, it appears that XiaoHao2 had only chosen to share the photos online after years of keeping the risky images to himself.
A Rare Glimpse into the World’s Most Secretive Country
The Redditor’s photos offer a remarkable glimpse into the day-to-day lives of the people of North Korea which is one of the world’s most mysterious and reclusive states.
Some of the photographer’s images show North Korean residents looking up at the drone and noticing it flying past them. In other images, individuals appear visibly startled at the sight the drone crossing into North Korean airspace.
Other eerie images showed mostly empty streets and buildings, including what appears to be a university and a main avenue near Sinuiju Chongnyon Station, according to The Korea Times.
While Redditors applauded XiaoHao2’s images of the closed-off nation, many social media users were concerned about the drone photographer’s safety. However, XiaHao confirmed that he was still “alive and free.”
North Korea has always been shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Its population of roughly 26 million people lives largely in isolation from the rest of the world in the communist state.
The country imposed some of the strictest border controls in the world during the spread of COVID-19, and has yet to fully reopen to foreigners.
People who have entered North Korea as tourists in the past have been met with strict rules about the practice of photography in the country. Travelers are also required to follow designated routes, and places where photography is allowed are severely restricted.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,134,South Korea's Yoon meets doctors in first sign of flexibility over walkout,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday met with the main representative of an association of young doctors who walked off the job in February, in his first in-person talks with physicians opposed to his medical reform plans. The meeting, which Yoon's office said lasted more than two hours, came after he showed the first signs of flexibility in his plan, having previously taken a hardline approach to the dispute.
The centrepiece of Yoon's plan is to raise the number of medical school admissions and increase the number of doctors, but many in the industry are instead concerned about securing better working conditions and legal protection. The government has said that without action the country faces having 15,000 fewer doctors than it needs to maintain essential services largely because its population is rapidly ageing.
Park Dan, who heads the Korean Intern Resident Association, accepted Yoon's invitation to meet with trainee doctors who walked off the job on Feb. 20 and conveyed the views of his colleagues, Yoon's office said in a brief statement. Yoon and Park exchanged views on improving working conditions and compensation for young doctors, it said.
The president's office said he will respect the position of the trainee doctors in his future discussions with the medical community on healthcare reforms, including increasing the number of doctors. The doctors' walkout has disrupted functions at hospitals, leading to patients being turned away and non-emergency surgeries being cut back.
Yoon has said the plan to raise the number of new medical students to 5,000 a year from the current 3,000 is not up for discussion but on Monday signalled there may be room for adjusting his plan if the medical community came forward with reasonable proposals. The country's practicing physicians and medical school professors have demanded Yoon scrap his reform plans.
The drawn-out walkout by thousands of trainee doctors nationwide is increasingly putting strains on the country's healthcare system. While a large majority of the public support the thrust of Yoon's plan, a poll on Monday showed more people are unhappy with the way his government has handled the stalemate.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,136,South Korea’s Doctors’ Walkout Spurs Thousands of Complaints,"Six weeks after thousands of residents and interns at South Korean hospitals walked off the job, frustration is rising.
Patients have filed more than 2,000 complaints about surgeries and other treatments being postponed, canceled or refused, according to the national health ministry. Hospitals have closed wards and restructured staff. Nurses have taken on duties usually performed by physicians, and military doctors have been deployed to public health centers.
Much of the anger over the disruptions is aimed at President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has not backed down from his proposal to dramatically expand medical school admissions to address a shortage of physicians. The young doctors who walked out in February to protest that plan say it wouldn’t solve the health care system’s problems.
But many people are also exasperated with the doctors, despite the exalted position that physicians hold in South Korea’s hierarchical society. Critics accuse them of trying to protect their elite status, and their income, by keeping the number of doctors low.",2024-04-04 04:01:15,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times,136,six south job frustration 2000 according national health ministry closed staff taken usually military public health anger president backed proposal dramatically expand medical school address shortage young protest plan say wouldnt solve health care many people also exasperated despite exalted position hold south hierarchical society accuse trying protect elite status income keeping number low south walkout
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,137,"Coming to Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI","“We hope to have a few more trolls in the future to connect the state and form a Rhode Island ‘troll trail,’” said Louise Bishop, South County Tourism Council president in a news release.
The trolls, which are made of recycled and reclaimed wood, will be unveiled at Ninigret Park in Charlestown in May. The initiative is part of a push from the South County Tourism council to bring more visitors to the Ocean State.
Two giant trolls are coming to Rhode Island this spring — an art installment of international fame by renowned Danish artist Thomas Dambo.
Dambo’s recycled art is featured more than 20 countries, including in China, Brazil, Australia, Germany, France, and South Korea. In the United States, Dambo’s trolls have drawn crowds in Illinois, Florida, and Kentucky. Five of his trolls, including one that stands nearly three stories tall, are tucked away in the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay.

“I am very much looking forward to coming to Rhode Island,” Dambo said in a press release. “My wife comes from New England, so I really love the area. I came last year for a site visit, I got to see so much of the beautiful area. I have a good idea for an installation with some really big stones. And if I have an obsession, it is that I like big stones.”

Dambo and his team will arrive in South County this month to start building the trolls, and they are looking for help from volunteers. (Interested volunteers can email jcordio@southcountyri.com.)
The imaginative artwork transports visitors to a magical world while conveying the importance of forest preservation, conservation, and our responsibility to the environment around us.
“My mission is Waste No More,” Dambo said in the release. “Our world is drowning in trash, while we are running out of natural resources. I spend my life showing the world that beautiful things can be made out of trash. I give new life to discarded materials by turning them into large-scale artworks. My aim at the moment is to build 1,000 Trolls using recycled materials all over the world.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,138,"Hollow Knight Silksong Has Been Rated In Korea, Please Remain Calm","Hollow Knight Silksong has been rated in Korea.
Ok. Ok. Everyone just chill out. Everybody just stay calm.
As spotted by VGC, which itself reported on a Resetera thread, it appears that Team Cherry’s anticipated Metroid-like sequel was rated in South Korea back in February and it simply flew under the radar until now. Its Korean rating shows classification officials rated it the equivalent of an Australian PG, suitable for players 12 years and over.
This news comes days after the game finally got a store page on Xbox, the last digital storefront to host the game. After its appearance on the Xbox Store started drawing attention, company president Sarah Bond took the opportunity to remind players that Silksong was coming to Game Pass on Day One.
Hollow Knight Silksong has been in development since at least 2017. In May last year, Team Cherry delayed the game from a planned 2023 launch and has not yet planted a flag on a new date.
Between this rating and the Xbox Store page, does it feel like there’s finally movement at the station? A little, yes. However, it’s worth remembering that a rating — even one from the Korean ratings board, which usually signals an imminent release date — does not mean a date is coming. Just look at Skull and Bones, which was rated in Australia almost a year before it actually got out the door.
For now, I’m urging we all just keep our Silksong hype meters set to Simmer. If anything else emerges, maybe it’s time to dial up the excitement. For now, let’s just stay seated and see how this plays out.

SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland — Canada's Brad Gushue extended his win streak to four games with another two-victory day at the world men's curling championship on Wednesday.
He scored a 7-4 win over Wouter Goesgens of the Netherlands in the morning draw at IWC Arena and defeated South Korea's Jongduk Park 7-4 in the evening.
Gushue and his St. John's, N.L.-based team of Mark Nichols, E.J. Harnden and Geoff Walker improved to 7-1 to remain in second place in the 13-team round-robin standings.
Sweden's Niklas Edin (8-0) was in top spot after 14 draws. The six-time world champion posted an 8-5 win over Germany's Marc Muskatewitz.
Round-robin play continues through Friday night. The top six teams will make the playoffs.
Medal games are scheduled for Sunday.
In the opener, Gushue scored a pair in the first end and stole a single in the second to take an early lead he wouldn't relinquish. He added a single in the sixth end, a deuce in the eighth and one more in the 10th to seal the win.
""I think once we got up three and knowing full well the ice conditions were going to get tougher, it was about keeping it simple and making their shots tough,"" Gushue said.
The game turned in the eighth end when Gushue made a runback before a tap for two. Goesgens was forced to a single in the ninth end and couldn't manage a game-tying steal of two in the 10th.
""This is a long week and it’s going to be gruelling so you don’t want to make it any more difficult than it has to be,"" Harnden said. ""That was a perfect example of patience today.""
Switzerland's Yannick Schwaller beat Czechia's Lukas Klima 7-4 in the evening and defending champion Bruce Mouat of Scotland got by Japan's Shinya Abe 7-5.
Canada started strong against South Korea but gave up a deuce in the fourth end and took a 4-3 lead into the mid-game break. Park missed a double-takeout in the sixth end to set up Gushue for a pair.
Down three with hammer coming home in the 10th, Park rolled out on his first shot — a hit-and-roll attempt — and the South Koreans conceded.
Sweden and Canada were ahead of Scotland and Switzerland (both 6-2) and Germany at 6-3. Top-ranked Joel Retornaz of Italy was 5-3 while Norway's Magnus Ramsfjell and American John Shuster were outside the playoff cutline at 4-4.
Czechia and Japan were 3-6 and the Netherlands was 2-6. New Zealand's Anton Hood (0-8) and South Korea (0-9) remained winless.
The top two seeds will earn direct berths to the semifinals. The other four playoff teams will play qualification games.
Gushue won world gold in 2017 at Edmonton but has settled for silver on three occasions since, including last year in Ottawa.

South Korea​ns go to the polls on April 10 to select a new 300-member National Assembly. The parliamentary elections are widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol. They will also serve as a vote of confidence on the opposition Democratic Party, which has held majority control in the Assembly for the past four years.
Mr. Yoon won the presidential election in March 2022 by a razor-thin margin, and three months later, his People Power Party won the most big-city mayor and provincial governor races. But two major handicaps have hobbled his presidency: his party’s lack of control in the single-chamber Assembly and Mr. Yoon’s low approval ratings.
​An electoral victory by his party could add momentum to Mr. Yoon’s four major reform programs involving the country’s health care, education, labor and national pension systems, as well as his promise to abolish the nation’s ministry of gender equality. Mr. Yoon will also see it as lending political legitimacy to his policy of aligning South Korea more closely with the United States.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,146,SK hynix Signs Investment Agreement of Advanced Chip Packaging with Indiana,"To build advanced packaging facility for next-generation HBM, while collaborating with Purdue University for R&D
Selects Indiana for strong support provided by the state and local government, infrastructure for manufacturing, and talent at Purdue .
Industry’s first investment in advanced packaging for AI products on American soil, strengthens supply-chain resilience
SEOUL, South Korea, April 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — SK hynix Inc. (or “the company”, www.skhynix.com), the world’s leading producer of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, announced today that it will invest an estimated $3.87 billion in West Lafayette, Indiana to build an advanced packaging fabrication and R&D facility for AI products. The project, the first of its kind in the United States, is expected to drive innovation in the nation’s AI supply chain, while bringing more than a thousand new jobs to the region.
The company held an investment agreement ceremony with officials from Indiana State, Purdue University, and the U.S. government at Purdue University in West Lafayette on the 3rd and officially announced the plan.
At the event, officials from each party including Governor of Indiana Eric Holcomb, Senator Todd Young, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Arati Prabhakar, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Arun Venkataraman, Secretary of Commerce State of Indiana David Rosenberg, Purdue University President Mung Chiang, Chairman of Purdue Research Foundation Mitch Daniels, Mayor of city of West Lafayette Erin Easter, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States Hyundong Cho, Consul General of the Republic of Korea in Chicago Junghan Kim, SK vice chairman Jeong Joon Yu, SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung and SK hynix Head of Package & Test Choi Woojin, participated.
Leveraging its dominant position in the HBM market, SK hynix’s new facility will be home to an advanced semiconductor production line that will mass-produce next-generation HBM, the highest-performing Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips, which are the critical components of graphic processing units that train AI systems such as ChatGPT.
* HBM (High Bandwidth Memory): A high-value, high-performance memory that vertically interconnects multiple DRAM chips and dramatically increases data processing speed in comparison with conventional DRAM products. HBM4 is the sixth generation of its kind, following HBM, HBM2, HBM2E, HBM3 and HBM3E.
The company plans to begin mass production in the second half of 2028, while the new facility will also develop future generations of chips and house an advanced packaging R&D line. The site was selected due to Indiana’s resilient manufacturing infrastructure and R&D ecosystem, expert intellectuals in the semiconductor field and the talent pipeline at Purdue University, and the strong support provided by the state and local government.
Innovation in memory chips continues to drive lower-power operations and performance enhancements in computing. As tech shrinkage and other hardware improvements have hit limits, SK hynix’s new chiplet packaging technology has emerged as a promising way to continue enhancing density and performance. As this heterogeneous integration technology becomes more and more important to the future of the semiconductor industry, the company’s new initiative in Indiana will help establish the region as a Silicon Heartland: a new semiconductor cluster centered in the Midwest Triangle that will become a magnet for next-generation computing in the AI era.
“Indiana is a global leader in innovating and producing the products that will power our future economy, and today’s news is proof positive to that fact,” said Governor Eric Holcomb. “I’m so proud to officially welcome SK hynix to Indiana, and we’re confident this new partnership will enhance the Lafayette-West Lafayette region, Purdue University and the state of Indiana for the long term. This new semiconductor innovation and packaging plant not only reaffirms the state’s role in the hard tech sector, but is also another tremendous step forward in advancing U.S. innovation and national security, putting Hoosiers at the forefront of national and global advancements.”
U.S. Senator Todd Young, a key advocate for the project, said, “SK hynix will soon be a household name in Indiana. This incredible investment demonstrates their confidence in Hoosier workers, and I’m excited to welcome them to our state.” Adding, “The CHIPS and Science Act opened a door that Indiana has been able to sprint through, and companies like SK hynix are helping to build our high-tech future.”
“SK hynix is the global pioneer and dominant market leader in memory chips for AI,” Purdue University President Mung Chiang said. “This transformational investment reflects our state and university’s tremendous strength in semiconductors, hardware AI, and hard tech corridor. It is also a monumental moment for completing the supply chain of digital economy in our country through chips advanced packaging. Located at Purdue Research Park, the largest facility of its kind at a U.S. university will grow and succeed through innovation.”
“We are excited to become the first in the industry to build a state-of-the-art advanced packaging facility for AI products in the United States that will help strengthen supply-chain resilience and develop a local semiconductor ecosystem,” said SK hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung. “With this new facility, we hope to advance our goal of providing AI memory chips with unmatched capabilities, serving the needs of our customers.”
“We are grateful for the support from the Government of Indiana, Purdue University, and the broader community involved, and we look forward to expanding our partnership in the long run.”
As a technology leader, integrator, and enabler in memory solutions, SK hynix is collaborating with Purdue University, one of the leading research institutions in the U.S., on plans for future R&D projects. These projects include work on advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration with Purdue’s Birck Nanotechnology Center and other research institutes and industry partners. They also hope to collaborate on a project related to memory-centric solutions and architecture for the generative AI era, specifically system-level memory design and in/near-memory computing.
The company also plans to collaborate with Purdue University and Ivy Tech Community College to develop training programs and interdisciplinary degree curricula that will cultivate a high-tech workforce and build a reliable pipeline of new talent.
Meanwhile, SK hynix plans to support the work of Purdue Research Foundation and other local non-profits and charities by building partnerships that provide community development, growth opportunities, and leadership training.
Separately, SK hynix will also proceed with Korean domestic investments as planned. The company has been working to prepare the site for the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster where it will invest 120 trillion won to build production facilities. The company plans to break ground on the first fab in March of 2025, with plans for completion in early 2027. It will also build a mini fab, a facility with equipment for 300mm wafer processing, to test semiconductor materials, components and equipment.

TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,147,South Korea’s Yoon Seeks Majority to End Parliament Deadlock,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea holds elections on April 10 for its parliament that will determine if President Yoon Suk Yeol can wrest control of the legislature and advance pro-business policies in the final three years of his term or instead becomes a virtual lame duck, with progressive forces continuing to thwart his agenda.
All 300 seats are up for grabs in the unicameral parliament known as the National Assembly, and Yoon’s conservative People Power Party is trying to flip more than 30 seats to gain the majority now held by the progressive camp led by the main opposition Democratic Party. The latest polling shows the PPP as the most popular party but its margin may not be enough to wrest control of the body in the election that serves as the only nationwide referendum on Yoon’s government during his single, five-year term.
Key issues for voters include inflation that is eating into paychecks, reining in housing prices and providing strength for the country’s export-driven and slowing economy. Yoon has been trying to end a walkout by doctors that has rattled the health care system before the polls, while North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is stirring the pot with provocations that include a missile launch and overseeing drills for operations that would be used in an invasion.
Here are a few key factors to watch:
Numbers
The most likely scenario is for the Democratic Party-led progressive bloc to keep its majority in parliament, which currently stands at 169 seats, with a few spots being flipped on the margins that do not dramatically upend the status quo. This would mean continued gridlock and compromise between the groups on key items such as the budget.
To get a majority, the PPP-led bloc would need to pick up 32 seats, a tall order especially with polling showing Yoon’s support rate in the mid 30% level.
If the progressive bloc can secure 180 seats, it can block any attempts to delay a legislative procedure, such as by filibuster. If it reaches 200 seats, it can override any presidential veto and approve impeachment measures, effectively hobbling and perhaps even ending Yoon’s government.
Policies
Yoon and the PPP are looking to: reduce regulations on businesses, take on labor unions, and cut taxes for companies and on real estate transactions. Yoon’s foreign policy initiatives that include closer security cooperation with the US and Japan are likely to stay intact regardless of the results.
The Democratic Party is looking to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and the chaebol conglomerates that dominate the corporate landscape. It also wants to scuttle plans to drop capital gains taxes on income from financial investments.
In the face of rising living costs, the ruling party said it would push to cut taxes on daily necessities, while the Democratic Party has proposed cash handouts, both of which critics say are populist pledges.
Election
Of the 300 seats, 254 are settled by direct elections in constituencies and the rest are allotted by proportional representation. Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The term of office for National Assembly members is four years.
In one of the last major polls released ahead of the vote, support was 37% for the PPP ahead of 29% for the main opposition Democratic Party. The Rebuilding Korea Party, a new group that looks set to align itself with the progressive Democratic Party, was in third place at 12%, according to the survey from Gallup Korea, which was conducted among 1,001 respondents nationwide. It said the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
Battlegrounds
The key fights will be in major urban areas such as Seoul, where the Democratic Party won 41 of 49 seats in the last election in 2020. Metro areas account for about 40% of the 300 seats and the Democratic Party took them by about a seven-to-one margin over the main conservative party in 2020, according to the Korea Herald.
Wild Cards
North Korea has a habit of provocations that coincide with elections and Kim’s regime has bristled at Yoon for taking a hard line on Pyongyang. Kim could be looking to stir up tensions to build support for the Democratic Party, which favors rapprochement with Pyongyang.
Cho Kuk, a former justice minister, is seeing a rise in support for his Rebuilding Korea Party, which could grab enough seats to change the dynamics in parliament. Cho, who was a prominent member of a Democratic Party government and forced out of office due to corruption charges, has indicated he could align with his former party, possibly giving it enough seats to reach certain thresholds of power.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,150,US Ally Seizes Chinese Vessels,"South Korea's Coast Guard seized five Chinese vessels for allegedly fishing illegally in the country's waters late last month, confiscating boats and deporting several crew members.
The coast guard said it carried out the raid while on patrol with the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries within the country's exclusive economic zone.
An exclusive economic zone is a 200-nautical-mile (230-mile) zone in which maritime law grants a coastal country the sole right to natural resources.
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing significantly harms global fish stocks, ecosystems, and the livelihoods of lawful fisherfolk. China, with the world's largest distant-water fishing fleet, plays a substantial role in this issue.
The joint patrol's 30 participating vessels and three aircraft waters were operating in the vicinity of Jeju Island from March 25-31, Korea JoongAng Daily reported.
The country's coast guard said that, on average, 300 Chinese vessels fish illegally in the country's exclusive waters each day, with that figure dropping to an estimated 140 during periods of intensified crackdowns.
One of the Chinese boats had prepared 31 large fishing nets, each one worth over $44,000, according to the maritime law enforcement agency. Patrol members destroyed 20 of these and planned to take possession of the others.
A Chinese vessel was also caught trespassing in waters near the de facto maritime boundary separating South Korea from the North.
The crew was found to have underreported their catches. They were also using a type of net banned in South Korea because it was specially designed to catch even young fish, depleting local stocks.
The Coast Guard issued a total of $333,000 in fines and arrested one of the boats' captains. Five of the Chinese nationals were later deported, according to the report.

""We will take strong measures against those who conduct illegal fishing activities, which ruin marine resources by sweeping up young fish,"" Korea JoongAng Daily quoted one Coast Guard official as saying.
The official pointed out that Seoul regularly discloses illegal fishing activities with international perpetrators' countries of origin during diplomatic talks and presses them to take preventative action.
Newsweek reached out to the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., and the Korea Oceanographic Data Center with written requests for comment.
Chinese fishing vessels are often linked to overfishing and resource exploitation in international waters and in the exclusive economic zones of other nations, challenging efforts to sustain marine populations and enforce regulations.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,151,North Korea says it tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile that’s easier to hide,"Open this photo in gallery: In this photo provided by the North Korean government, Kim Jong Un, left, supervises artillery firing drills in North Korea on March 7.���N�ʐM��/The Associated Press
North Korea said Wednesday it had tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, extending a run of weapons tests that’s deepening a nuclear standoff with neighbours and the United States.
With the supposed success of the demonstration, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his country had acquired the ability to build solid-fuel, nuclear-capable missiles of all ranges as he pursues an arsenal that can credibly threaten rivals in Asia and the United States.
But the South Korean military said the North is exaggerating the success of the test and its overall missile prowess.
The report by North Korean state media came a day after the South Korean and Japanese militaries detected a missile launched from near the North’s capital toward its eastern sea.
State media said the test was supervised by Kim, who described the Hwasong-16B missile as a key piece of his nuclear deterrent he vowed to further build up to counter his “enemies,” a reference to the United States, South Korea and Japan.
In recent years, North Korea has been developing more missiles with built-in solid propellants. Such weapons are easier to move and hide, and can be launched quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled before launch and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time.
North Korea tested a solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time last year, adding to its arsenal of long-range weapons targeting the U.S. mainland. The country also has an extensive lineup of short-range and mid-range solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from land vehicles, ships and submarines and are potentially capable of hitting targets throughout South Korea and Japan. In recent months, the North demonstrated some of these missiles in drills it described as simulated nuclear strikes.
Since 2021, it’s also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defence systems because of their speed and manoeuvrability. However, it’s unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims.
North Korean official media KCNA claimed that during the Tuesday test, the missile’s hypersonic glide warhead reached a peak altitude of 101 kilometres (62 miles) and flew about 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) after separating from the launch rocket, and performed various manoeuvres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday maintained its assessment that the missile flew about 600 kilometres (372 miles) and accused North Korea of exaggerating the missile’s flight performance, although acknowledging that the North’s technologies were improving. The previous day, Japan reported a similar flight distance, although its Defense Ministry reported a maximum height close to that claimed by the North.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff said it remains unclear whether the North has perfected the technologies to ensure that the warheads of its hypersonic solid-fuel missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry.
“Hypersonic missiles are weapons systems that are still being developed by advanced nations (the United States, China and Russia etc.) and they require highly difficult technologies,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters. “It’s difficult to predict when they will be deployed operationally, but it’s expected to take a considerable amount of time.”
The North also tested a purported hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile in January, years after it flight-tested liquid-fuel IRBMs. Experts say such weapons if perfected is potentially capable of reaching remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
“North Korea’s development of hypersonic IRBMs targets Guam, which hosts U.S. military bases, and even Alaska,” said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Research Institute for National Strategy.
Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the missile tested on Tuesday was likely different from the system tested in January, which state media didn’t name but was likely the Hwasong-16A.
North Korea in previous tests have unveiled two different types of hypersonic vehicles – a conical one and a wedge-shaped one. State media images show that the January launch involved a conical warhead while the wedge-shaped design was used for Tuesday’s launch.
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
Hours after the launch, Seoul’s Defense Ministry announced that South Korea, the United States and Japan conducted a combined aerial exercise above waters near South Korea’s Jeju island that involved at least one nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bomber.",2024-04-03 13:25:12,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail,151,open photo gallery photo provided north government kim un left artillery firing north korea march 7nʐmthe associated korea said tested new hypersonic missile powered solid extending run thats deepening nuclear standoff united supposed success demonstration north leader kim un declared country acquired ability build arsenal credibly threaten united south military said north exaggerating success test overall missile report north state medium came day south missile near capital toward eastern medium said test kim hwasong16b missile key piece nuclear deterrent vowed build counter reference united south korea recent north korea solid easier move hide need launch stay long korea tested intercontinental ballistic missile first time last year arsenal u country also extensive midrange fired land potentially capable throughout south korea japan recent north nuclear 2021 also testing hypersonic designed fly five time speed sound perfected could potentially pose challenge regional missile defence speed however unclear whether consistently flying north official medium test hypersonic glide peak altitude 101 62 flew 1000 621 separating launch rocket various landing peninsula joint staff assessment missile flew 600 372 accused north korea exaggerating flight performance although improving previous day japan similar flight distance although defense ministry maximum height close joint staff said remains unclear whether north perfected ensure hypersonic intercontinental ballistic survive harsh atmospheric still advanced united china russia require highly difficult joint staff said text message difficult predict take considerable amount north also tested hypersonic ballistic missile say perfected potentially capable reaching remote u development hypersonic u military base even said chang missile expert south research institute national professor university north said missile tested likely different system tested state medium didnt name likely hwasong16anorth korea previous unveiled two different hypersonic conical one one state medium show launch involved conical design used region risen since 2022 kim used invasion distraction accelerate testing united south korea expanding combined training trilateral japan deterrence built around strategic u launch defense ministry south korea united japan combined aerial exercise near south island involved least one u b52 bomber north korea tested new hypersonic missile thats easier hide

Last month, North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles as part of its renewed weapons test, raising tensions after the conclusion of US-South Korean military drills viewed by Pyongyang as an invasion rehearsal. The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month. Experts predicted earlier that North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,155,North Korea says it tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile that uses solid propellants,"North Korea said Wednesday it had tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, extending a run in weapons demonstrations that’s deepening a nuclear standoff with neighbors and the United States.
With the supposed success of the test, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his country had acquired the ability to build solid-fuel, nuclear-capable systems for missiles of all ranges as he pursues an arsenal that could viably threaten rivals in Asia and the United States.

In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods of time.

The country also has an extensive lineup of short-range and mid-range solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from land vehicles, ships and submarines and are potentially capable of reaching targets throughout South Korea and Japan. The North in recent months demonstrated some of these missiles in drills it described as simulated nuclear strikes while issuing provocative threats of nuclear conflict.
The North has since 2021 also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to exceed five times the speed of sound.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,156,North Korea Claims New Hypersonic Missile Milestone,"North Korea has said it successfully tested a new hypersonic missile powered by solid propellants, a day after South Korea and Japan detected a missile launched from Pyongyang toward the east.
The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) published photos on Wednesday of leader Kim Jong Un overseeing the launch of the Hwasong-16B, equipped with a hypersonic glide warhead. He said the new medium-to-long-range missile demonstrates the ""absolute superiority"" of Pyongyang's defense technology and is a key piece of his nuclear war deterrent.
In January, North Korea launched what it said was its first hypersonic missile, with the South saying it flew 620 miles before landing off the Korean Peninsula's east coast.
Hypersonic missiles are designed to fly at a speed of more than five times the speed of sound, and their warheads manoeuver mid-flight, making them difficult to track and intercept. Missiles powered with solid propellants do not need to be fuelled immediately ahead of launch. This makes them easier to launch at short notice, harder to detect and destroy, and more survivable than missiles that have a liquid-fuel system.
North Korea has now developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for ""all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges,"" Kim said after the test launch, KCNA reported.

The missile is ""another powerful strategic offensive weapon"" and Pyongyang has achieved its goal of developing missiles ""with various ranges on solid-fueled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis,"" the North Korean leader said.
It would give Pyongyang the capacity for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide,"" Kim added, likely referencing the United States, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea's military said the missile traveled about 600 kilometers (372 miles) before landing in waters of the East Sea between Japan and South Korea. KCNA offered different figures, saying it flew around 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), reaching a peak altitude of 101 kilometers (62 miles). However, South Korea has disputed this, saying the numbers were exaggerated.
KCNA also said had limited the missile's range ""in consideration of safety.""
""The test-fire had no adverse effect on the security of neighbouring countries,"" KCNA added.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Republic of Korea said in a statement that ""the flight distance claimed by North Korea (1,000 km) differs from our military's analysis and is evaluated as an exaggeration,"" adding, ""The results of the analysis by South Korea, the United States and Japan are over 600 km,"" Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency reported.",2024-04-03 08:30:23,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek,156,north korea said successfully tested new hypersonic missile powered solid day south korea japan missile toward central news agency leader kim un launch hwasong16b hypersonic glide said new missile absolute superiority defense technology key piece nuclear war north korea said first hypersonic missile south saying flew 620 landing east designed fly speed five time speed sound making difficult track intercept powered solid need immediately ahead launch easier launch short notice harder detect destroy survivable korea tactical operational strategic various kim said test launch woman past television screen showing news broadcast file footage north missile test railway station 2 2024 north korea fired woman past television screen showing news broadcast file footage north missile test railway station 2 2024 north korea fired ballistic missile 2 military said latest spate kim regime year missile another powerful strategic offensive weapon goal various nuclear basis north leader would give capacity rapidly accurately powerfully striking target enemy side kim added likely united south korea military said missile traveled 600 372 landing east sea japan south korea different saying flew around 1000 620 reaching peak altitude 101 62 however south korea saying also said limited range consideration adverse effect security joint staff republic korea said statement flight distance north korea 1000 analysis exaggeration analysis south korea united japan 600 news agency north korea new hypersonic missile milestone
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,157,North Korea aims to adopt solid-fuel missiles for faster launches,"North Korea successfully test-fired a new hypersonic missile, state news agency KCNA said on Wednesday, the latest step in a plan its leader Kim Jong Un described as aimed at using solid fuel to power missiles of all ranges. The North is developing missiles and nuclear weapons undeterred by sanctions in the wake of U.N. Security Council bans, while analysts say solid-fuel missiles can be faster to deploy than liquid-fuel variants.
It drew swift condemnation from neighbours South Korea and Japan, as well as the United States for firing the intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) into the sea on Tuesday. Kim oversaw the launch of the new Hwasong-16B missile, KCNA said, calling it a strategic weapon showcasing the ""absolute superiority"" of the North's defence technology.
It perfects the North's project for ""putting all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges on solid-fuelled, warhead-controlled and nuclear warhead-carrying basis,"" Kim said, according to KCNA. That would give North Korea the capacity for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide,"" Kim said.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the launch probably focused on testing the missile's flight performance in the early stage of development, an area in which North Korea appeared to have made partial progress. But it ""exaggerated"" several specifications, from flight range to a delay in igniting the second-stage engine and quickly changing flight orbit, the JCS said.
Analysts said it was unclear if the North would exclusively build solid-fuel missiles in future, and what a switch would mean for its arsenal of liquid-fuel weapons, such as its largest Hwasong-17 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). North Korea may heavily favour solid-fuel systems where possible, but actually phasing out liquid-fuel weapons would likely only play out over years, said Ankit Panda of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""There are obvious strategic advantages to an all-solid-fuel force for them in the form of greater promptness, responsiveness, and survivability,"" he added. North Korea would need to have high confidence in its production capabilities to allow solid-fuel missiles to sit for a number of years, during which they may develop imperfections that lead to in-flight failures, Panda added.
""India and other countries have had problems with this sort of thing with solid-fuel missiles,"" he said. ""Liquid-fuel missiles, despite their strategic disadvantages, don't face this particular long-term handling problem."" A move away from liquid fuel would be surprising, given recent state media coverage of such weapons, but would make sense if North Korea wants an extremely responsive missile force, said Decker Eveleth of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California.
""Solid-fuel missiles are much, much faster to get off the ground in an emergency,"" he said in a post on X. Such a shift could also see North Korea place some ICBMs in silos, in addition to the mobile launch vehicles it has exclusively used so far, Eveleth added.
North Korea's pursuit of hypersonic vehicles helps its broader effort to field warheads tougher to intercept. Warheads typically launched by such missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200 kph (3,850 mph), often manoeuvring at relatively low altitudes.
That manoeuvrability, not speed, is the most attractive feature of such weapons, analysts say, as the latter can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads. Tuesday's launch, which followed a ground test late in March of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile, was also condemned by Britain, which said it breached UN Security Council resolutions.
In a rare step, South Korea seized a ship off its coast for suspected violations of the North Korean sanctions, the Donga Ilbo newspaper said on Wednesday. The South's foreign ministry confirmed it was investigating the vessel for possible violations in co-operation with the United States, but declined further comment.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,161,EXPLAINER-Why is North Korea testing hypersonic missiles and how do they work?,"North Korea has tested a new solid-fuel hypersonic missile with intermediate range, it said on Wednesday, in an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range rockets hard to track and intercept.
The United States, China, Russia and other countries have also been developing hypersonic weapons in recent years. HOW DO THE MISSILES WORK?
The warheads they launch typically travel at more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200 kph (3,850 mph), often at relatively low altitudes. Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but manoeuvrability.
North Korea's first hypersonic missile test in 2021 featured a glider-shaped warhead, while a 2022 launch used what South Korean military officials and analysts said was actually a conical manoeuvrable reentry vehicle (MaRV), or a ballistic missile warhead capable of manoeuvring to hit a target. State media said the North's latest test was aimed at perfecting an arsenal for ""rapidly, accurately and powerfully striking any target in the enemy side worldwide"".
Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could further strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defence mechanisms. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit.
WHO LEADS THE RACE? In February Russia for the first time fired its Zircon hypersonic cruise missile against Ukraine, researchers said. President Vladimir Putin has touted the weapon as part of a new generation and Moscow has also tested it from a submarine and a frigate.
China launched a rocket carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle that flew through space in 2021, circling the globe before cruising down toward its target, which it missed by about two dozen miles, however. In Sept 2021, the United States said it had tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon - meaning it flies on its own through the atmosphere like a cruise missile - in the first successful test of that class of weapon since 2013.
WHAT IS NORTH KOREA'S HYPERSONIC GOAL? At a Jan. 2021 meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, leader Kim Jong Un set securing the weapons as one of five key objectives of a five-year plan to boost military power, alongside developing solid-fuel ICBMs and a nuclear submarine.
In Sept. 2021, the North described its first hypersonic missile as a ""strategic weapon"" designed to bolster its defence capabilities, though some South Korean analysts called the test a failure. In early 2022, Seoul officials said the North tested another missile, potentially another hypersonic one, that flew at relatively low altitudes at up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,340 kmh/7,670 mph).
In January Pyongyang launched its first such missile powered by solid fuel to ensure a quicker launch with less preparation. On a rare trip to Russia last September, Kim inspected Moscow's hypersonic missiles, among other weapons.
WHY DOES IT MATTER? The global push for hypersonic weapons is part of an arms race in which smaller Asian nations are striving to develop advanced long-range missiles alongside major military powers.
Hypersonic weapons and FOBS could be a concern as they can potentially evade missile shields and early warning systems. ""Mid- to long-range hypersonic missiles would be useful for striking Guam while evading the U.S. missile defence system,"" said Chang Young-keun, a professor at Korea Aerospace University.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,163,North Korea says it tested new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with hypersonic warhead,"North Korea said Wednesday it tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, extending a run in weapons demonstrations that’s deepening a nuclear standoff with neighbours and the United States.
With the supposed success of the test, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his country had acquired the ability to build solid-fuel, nuclear-capable systems for missiles of all ranges as he pursues an arsenal that could viably threaten rivals in Asia and the United States.
The report by North Korean state media came a day after the South Korean and Japanese militaries detected the North launching a missile from near its capital toward its eastern sea.

North Korean state media said the test was supervised by Kim, who described the Hwasong-16B missile as a key piece of his nuclear war deterrent he vowed to further build up to counter his “enemies,” a reference to the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Kim said the North has now developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for “all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges,” the Korean Central News Agency said.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled before launch and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time.

The country also has an extensive lineup of short-range and mid-range solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from land vehicles, ships and submarines and are potentially capable of reaching targets throughout South Korea and Japan. The North in recent months demonstrated some of these missiles in drills it described as simulated nuclear strikes while issuing provocative threats of nuclear conflict.

The North has since 2021 also been testing hypersonic weapons designed to exceed five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defence systems because of their speed and maneuverability. However, it’s unclear whether the North’s hypersonic vehicles consistently maintained a desired speed exceeding Mach 5 during tests in 2021 and 2022.
During Tuesday’s test, the missile’s hypersonic glide warhead after being separated from the launch rocket reached a peak altitude of 101 km (62 miles) and flew about 1,000 km (621 miles) while performing various flight maneuvers before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, the KCNA said.
The South Korean and Japanese militaries had assessed that the missile flew around 600 (372 miles) although Japan’s Defence Ministry announced a similar apogee with the North Korean report.
The North had also tested a purported hypersonic IRBM in January, which came years after it flight-tested liquid-fuel IRBMs. Experts say such weapons if perfected is potentially capable of reaching remote US targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.

Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the missile tested on Tuesday was likely different from the system tested in January, which state media didn’t name but would likely be the Hwasong-16A.
North Korea in previous tests have unveiled two different types of hypersonic vehicles – a conical one and a wedge-shaped one. State media images show that the January launch involved a conical warhead while the wedge-shaped design was used for Tuesday’s launch.
While North Korea had initially tested its hypersonic warheads with liquid-fuel systems, the ability to load them on solid-fuel rockets would allow for faster launches and operation, said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Research Institute for National Strategy.
“North Korea, in declaring that it has fully accomplished the nuclear weaponisation of its missiles, also emphasised its commitment to arm its hypersonic missiles with nuclear weapons,” Chang said. “North Korea’s development of hypersonic IRBMs targets Guam, which hosts US military bases, and even Alaska.” Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets.

While supervising Tuesday’s test, Kim Jong Un called for his country to further expand its nuclear and missile programme to acquire “overwhelming power capable of containing and controlling” his enemies, who have “recently run higher fever in boosting their military alliance and staging all sorts of war drills”.
Hours after the launch, Seoul’s Defence Ministry announced that South Korea, the United States and Japan conducted a combined aerial exercise above waters near South Korea’s Jeju island that involved at least one nuclear-capable US B-52 bomber.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,166,North Korea says it test-fired new solid-fuel hypersonic missile,"North Korea successfully test-fired a new mid- to long-range solid-fuel, hypersonic missile, state media KCNA said on Wednesday.
North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Tuesday in a possible test, drawing swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch, KCNA said, lauding it as a strategic weapon that demonstrates the “absolute superiority” of North Korea’s defence technology.
With this, North Korea has “fully turned all tactical, operational, and strategic-grade missiles of different ranges into solid-fuel, with warhead control, and capable of nuclearization,” Kim said, according to KCNA.
Hypersonic missiles are more difficult to intercept, while missiles with solid fuel can be moved and stored more easily, meaning they can be ready to launch at short notice.
Tuesday’s test followed a ground test in late March of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile.
Britain also condemned North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch on Tuesday, saying it breached multiple UN Security Council resolutions.
Meanwhile, a North Korean diplomatic delegation that visited China, Vietnam and Laos, as well as an economic delegation to Russia, have all returned home on Tuesday, KCNA said.",2024-04-02 22:20:40,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail,166,north korea successfully new mid hypersonic missile state medium said korea fired suspected ballistic missile sea possible test drawing swift condemnation south korea japan united leader kim un launch said strategic weapon absolute superiority north defence north korea fully turned tactical operational different control capable kim said according difficult intercept solid fuel easily meaning ready launch short test ground test late march engine new type hypersonic also condemned north latest ballistic missile launch saying multiple un security council north diplomatic delegation china well economic delegation russia returned home said north korea new hypersonic missile
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,168,North Korea’s Kim Jong Un leads test of new missile that can hit US bases,"SEOUL – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test of a new ballistic missile designed to deploy a hypersonic glide vehicle that can deliver a nuclear payload, his state media reported, calling the test “an epoch-making success”.
Mr Kim’s propaganda apparatus on April 3 lauded the launch of the missile that took place a day earlier, which it said was of intermediate range – meaning it could hit US military bases in the region.
The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea and Japan, as well as the US.
It remains to be seen if North Korea has actually developed a functional hypersonic glide vehicle. These weapons are designed to deploy a re-entry vehicle for carrying a nuclear warhead that can change its flight path at high speeds, making it hard for interceptors to shoot down.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the launch probably focused on testing the missile’s flight performance in the early stage of development, an area in which North Korea appeared to have made partial progress.
But it “exaggerated” several specifications, from flight range to a delay in igniting the second-stage engine and quickly changing flight orbit, the JCS said.
The missile launched on April 2 flew about 600km, it said, and appeared to be related to a new engine for a hypersonic missile system that North Korea tested about a month ago.
State media showed images of the North Korean leader near the missile, dubbed the Hwasong-16B, prior to launch and the rocket flying in the air.
Mr Kim “has personally blazed the ceaseless untrodden path to developing and perfecting ultra-modern weapons with his unshakable will and inexhaustible energy”, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.
Analysts said it was unclear if the North would exclusively build solid-fuel missiles in the future, and what a switch would mean for its arsenal of liquid-fuel weapons, such as its largest Hwasong-17 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
North Korea may heavily favour solid-fuel systems where possible, but actually phasing out liquid-fuel weapons would likely only play out over years, said Mr Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
“There are obvious strategic advantages to an all-solid-fuel force for them in the form of greater promptness, responsiveness and survivability,” he added.
North Korea’s pursuit of hypersonic vehicles helps its broader effort to field warheads tougher to intercept.
Warheads typically launched by such missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200kmh, often manoeuvring at relatively low altitudes.
That manoeuvrability, not speed, is the most attractive feature of such weapons, analysts say, as the latter can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads.
The North has a habit of provocations that coincide with elections in South Korea, and the launch came before a vote for a new Parliament on April 10.
Mr Kim’s regime has bristled at the government of conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has taken a hard line on Pyongyang, and the latest launch serves as a reminder of the North’s threats to security.
North Korea last tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile in January.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,171,"Korea Zinc agrees 40% fee cut to turn Teck's mined zinc into metal, sources say","Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual conference in Toronto
By Julian Luk and Joyce Lee
LONDON/SEOUL (Reuters) - Canadian miner Teck Resources has agreed to pay Korea Zinc $165 per metric ton, a three-year low, to turn its zinc concentrate into refined metal, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Known as treatment charges (TCs), the fees paid for converting raw materials into zinc metals fall when mine output decreases as smelters have to compete for concentrate.
Korea Zinc declined to comment. Teck Resources said it ""does not comment on commercial negotiations"".
Teck and Korea Zinc are major players in the market for zinc used to galvanise steel for the construction industry.

Their annual agreement on yearly processing charges that miners pay smelters, for supply from Teck's Red Dog mine in Alaska, is often used as a benchmark by the industry.
The fee Teck has agreed with Korea Zinc has dropped 40% from $274 per ton last year and is the lowest since 2021.
Low zinc prices in recent months have led to mine closures, including Boliden's Tara operation in Ireland. Major mines like Glencore's McArthur River zinc and lead mine in Australia also recently suspended operations due to extreme weather conditions.
Korea Zinc, the world's biggest producer of both zinc and lead, bulk buys concentrate for a group of smelters including Seokpo, operated by Young Poong Corp, this year.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,174,Nuclear fusion reactor in South Korea runs at 100 million degrees C for a record-breaking 48 seconds,"South Korea's ""artificial sun"" has set a new fusion record after superheating a plasma loop to 180 million degrees Fahrenheit (100 million degrees Celsius) for 48 seconds, scientists have announced.
The Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) reactor broke the previous world record of 31 seconds, which was set by the same reactor in 2021.The breakthrough is a small but impressive step on the long road to a source of near-unlimited clean energy.
Scientists have been trying to harness the power of nuclear fusion — the process by which stars burn — for more than 70 years. By fusing hydrogen atoms to make helium under extremely high pressures and temperatures, so-called main-sequence stars convert matter into light and heat, generating enormous amounts of energy without producing greenhouse gases or long-lasting radioactive waste.
But replicating the conditions found inside the hearts of stars is no simple task. The most common design for fusion reactors — the tokamak — works by superheating plasma (one of the four states of matter, consisting of positive ions and negatively charged free electrons) and trapping it inside a donut-shaped reactor chamber with powerful magnetic fields.
Keeping the turbulent and superheated coils of plasma in place long enough for nuclear fusion to happen, however, has been a painstaking process. Soviet scientist Natan Yavlinsky designed the first tokamak in 1958, but no one has ever managed to create a reactor that is able to put out more energy than it takes in.

One of the main stumbling blocks has been how to handle a plasma that's hot enough to fuse. Fusion reactors require very high temperatures — many times hotter than the sun — because they have to operate at much lower pressures than where fusion naturally takes place inside the cores of stars. The core of the actual sun, for example, reaches temperatures of around 27 million F (15 million C) but has pressures roughly equal to 340 billion times the air pressure at sea level on Earth.

Cooking plasma to these temperatures is the relatively easy part, but finding a way to corral it so that it doesn't burn through the reactor without also ruining the fusion process is technically tricky. This is usually done either with lasers or magnetic fields.
To extend their plasma's burning time from the previous record-breaking run, the scientists tweaked aspects of their reactor's design, including replacing carbon with tungsten to improve the efficiency of the tokamak’s ""divertors,"" which extract heat and ash from the reactor.
""Despite being the first experiment run in the environment of the new tungsten divertors, thorough hardware testing and campaign preparation enabled us to achieve results surpassing those of previous KSTAR records in a short period,"" Si-Woo Yoon, the director of the KSTAR Research Center, said in a statement.
KSTAR scientists are aiming to push the reactor to sustain temperatures of 180 million F for 300 seconds by 2026.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,175,North Korea Wants To Put 'Several' Spy Satellites Into Orbit This Year,"North Korea plans to follow up last year's launch of a spy satellite by putting several more in orbit by the end of this year, according to state media.
Pyongyang plans to make itself a ""space power,"" putting it on the fast track to economic and scientific prowess, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) wrote Monday in a report marking the 11th anniversary of North Korea's space industry.
The reclusive country successfully launched its first surveillance satellite, Malligyong-1, last November. The U.S. condemned the action as a breach of the United Nations Security Council resolutions aimed at limiting dual-use technology that could advance the Kim Jong Un regime's ballistic missile program.
The launch also set into motion a North-South tit-for-tat that further raised the temperature on the Korean Peninsula.
The report cited National Aerospace Technology Administration Deputy Director General Pak Kyong So as saying Malligyong-1 represented the progress the ruling Workers' Party of Korea has made toward strengthening national defense as part of the party's policy of conquering space.
He added that ""several"" more reconnaissance satellites are planned for this year.
""The development of the space industry is of great importance in the construction of a powerful socialist country in which the leap forward is firmly guaranteed by cutting-edge science and technology,"" he was quoted as saying.
The North Korean embassy in China did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
Doubts remained about the functionality of Malligyong-1 until February, when Marco Langbroek, aerospace engineering professor at the Netherlands' Delft University, reported a satellite station at Leiden, the Netherlands, had observed the spacecraft executing perigee burns to rise to a higher orbit.
""One thing we have seen is that both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea missile and space programs very quickly learn from failures, and we are now seeing them getting more and more successful,"" Langbroek told Newsweek.
""I have just completed an additional analysis that shows that all these small maneuvers were done at moments that the satellite passed over North Korea, and all around 10-11 p.m. local time. So control seems to be done from North Korea itself (i.e. not outsourced to China or Russia), likely from Pyongyang's General Satellite Control Center.""
He added that it ""makes sense they are going to try to launch more and gain more experience with that.""

Korean Central News Agency
The KCNA article followed last week's statement by South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung-jun that the North was already laying the groundwork for a new satellite launch, though he added there was no indication the launch was imminent.
After two prior attempts believed to be failures, North Korea said it put Malligyong-1 into orbit on November 21, 2023, in what the White House called a ""brazen violation"" of United Nations Security Council sanctions. North Korea said the move was necessary for self-defense.
Seoul responded by partially suspending a landmark 2018 defense agreement meant to reduce the risk of military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, prompting Pyongyang to drop the pact entirely, further intensifying the diplomatic freeze between the North and South.
In December, South Korea launched its own first spy satellite aboard a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX, leading the North to decry the U.S.'s ""double standard.""",2024-04-02 11:57:12,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek,175,north korea follow last launch spy satellite several orbit end year according state make space power fast track economic scientific prowess central news agency wrote report marking 11th anniversary north space reclusive country successfully first surveillance satellite malligyong1 last u condemned action breach united security council limiting technology could advance kim un ballistic missile launch also set motion raised temperature report national technology administration deputy director general saying malligyong1 progress ruling party korea made toward strengthening national defense part policy conquering added several reconnaissance development space industry great importance construction powerful socialist country leap forward firmly science technology north embassy china immediately respond written request functionality malligyong1 marco engineering professor delft university satellite station perigee rise higher thing seen democratic republic korea missile space quickly learn seeing getting successful told additional analysis small done satellite north korea around 1011 local time control done north korea ie china russia likely general satellite control added sense going try launch gain experience leader kim rocket carrying surveillance satellite malligyong1 location north province north korea 21 2023 north leader kim rocket carrying surveillance satellite malligyong1 location north province north korea 21 2023 central news article last statement south joint staff lee north already laying groundwork new satellite launch though added indication launch two prior north korea said put malligyong1 orbit 21 2023 white house brazen violation united security council north korea said move necessary partially landmark 2018 defense agreement meant reduce risk military conflict peninsula drop pact entirely diplomatic freeze north south korea first spy satellite aboard falcon 9 rocket leading north decry double standard north korea put several spy orbit year
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,176,Tottenham fury as Son Heung-min 'legend' claim brutally shut down by former Chelsea star,"Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min is not a Premier League legend, according to former Chelsea and Aston Villa midfielder Andy Townsend.
Son arrived in England in August 2015, when Tottenham signed him from Bayer Leverkusen. The left winger, who can also play as a centre-forward, has gone on to enjoy a fantastic career in North London.
Son has scored 160 goals and registered a further 82 assists in 399 appearances for Tottenham. This season, he has managed 15 goals and eight assists in 26 league matches and is Tottenham’s top goalscorer.
The South Korean currently sits fifth on the list of Spurs’ all-time record scorers, with only Martin Chivers, Bobby Smith, Sir Jimmy Greaves and Harry Kane netting more goals for the club.
While Son has been a fantastic servant to Spurs, both he and Kane have been let down by the fact the club has not managed to win any silverware since 2008.
While Son and Kane are modern-day icons at Spurs, their lack of trophies holds them back when it comes to ranking some of the best players in the world, and indeed of all time.
DON’T MISS – Tottenham striker search: Dream signing, realistic options and perfect Postecoglou projects all assessed
Townsend, who won two League Cups with Villa and also made 124 appearances for Chelsea, does not believe Son can be called a ‘legend’ in the Premier League.
When asked on talkSPORT if winning more trophies would help Son’s cause, Townsend replied: “He is a top player, he’s a great; that word ‘legend’ should only be used in the right context.”
Son Heung-min a Spurs ‘great’ but not a Prem ‘legend’
Townsend jokingly added: “Someone put that on your script about me earlier and it’s not right.
“I think that Son has been a great player and great operator for Spurs, but a legend? No.”
Son will be aiming to prove Townsend and his other doubters wrong by helping Spurs win a trophy under Ange Postecoglou.
While that will not happen this season, as Spurs were knocked out of both the FA Cup and League Cup, Son and Postecoglou will be hoping to end the club’s curse next term.
The team has improved hugely this campaign and if they can make some more clever signings this summer it will give them a good chance of finally lifting some silverware.
Spurs could also feature in a European competition next season, as they currently sit in fifth spot in the Premier League, three points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with a game in hand.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,177,Even if there is a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra you might not be able to buy it,"Will there be a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra? Or what about a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE? These are perhaps the biggest questions surrounding Samsung’s upcoming foldable phones, as we’ve seen leaks about both a super-premium Ultra model and a more affordable FE version, and there’s still uncertainty over whether one, both, or neither will actually launch.
The latest leak again points towards a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra being in the works, as GalaxyClub (via NotebookCheck) claims that Samsung is working on a device with the model number SM-F958.
Now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 has the model number SM-F946, and the last digit on Samsung’s Fold model numbers is always a 6 – so the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will most likely be the SM-F956.
So what about SM-F958? Well, the number ‘8’ is used at the end of model numbers for Samsung’s Ultra phones, with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for example having the model number SM-928.
So, with SM-F958 looking like a Z Fold model number, but with an 8 at the end, the logical assumption is that this is the rumored Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra.
Coming to a store not so near you
The bad news, however, is that you might not be able to buy this phone – and we don’t just mean because it’s sure to be out of most people’s reach price-wise.
You see, the complete model number spotted by GalaxyClub is actually SM-F958N, with that ‘N’ at the end denoting that it’s intended for South Korea. The site goes so far as to say that this South Korean model is the only version that “appears to be under development.”

Now, it’s entirely possible that GalaxyClub’s information is wrong or incomplete, so even if it’s right about the model numbers there could be variants planned for the rest of the world too. But it’s not impossible that Samsung would limit this phone to its home country, especially while testing the waters with the first generation of a foldable Ultra device.
We should also add that none of this precludes the possibility of a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold FE launching as well. It’s entirely possible that Samsung is working on both, and perhaps the more affordable FE will also be more widely available.
Leaks and past form suggest that the standard Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will be announced in late July, alongside the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, so we might also see the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra and/or FE then too – although we’ve heard elsewhere that if there is a Galaxy Z Fold 6 FE, it might land later, in September or October. Whatever, we’ll be sure to update you on all the news and leaks in the meantime.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,179,US urges South Korea to tighten chip export curbs on China,"The U.S. wants South Korea to further restrict the export of advanced semiconductor technology and tools used for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, Bloomberg News reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. has asked South Korea to adopt similar export restrictions on China as it has. The move is part of Washington's efforts to impede the advance of China's semiconductor industry over national security concerns.
The potential curbs are aimed at including logic chips more advanced than 14-nanometer and a type of memory known as DRAM beyond 18nm. This would be consistent with a set of restrictions the U.S. Department of Commerce first announced in 2022, the report added.
U.S. officials and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government had discussed the issues in March. The U.S. intends to reach an agreement before a G7 summit in mid-June, however, the Asian nation is mulling the idea because China remains an important trading partner, according to the report.
Earlier this month, the U.S., reportedly, was urging its allies including the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan to further tighten the export of semiconductor equipment, spare parts and chip chemicals to China.
However, this timeline could be disturbed as officials from South Korea, Japan and the U.S. intend to meet in late June to discuss cooperation on advanced technology and supply chains.
Last week, the Biden administration further updated its rules, making it difficult for China to access U.S. AI chips and chipmaking equipment, as part of its efforts to impede the advance of China's semiconductor industry over national security concerns.
The move did not go unnoticed by China, as on Monday it criticized the move noting that the restrictions created additional obstacles to trade and more uncertainty in the chip industry.
South Korea is worried about potential penalties China may impose in response to the export controls, as several tech companies, including Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, still operate in China, Seoul's biggest trading partner, the report added.
With support from Samsung and Hynix, South Korea makes some of the world's most advanced logic and memory chips. However, the country's chip equipment suppliers are not as prominent as the U.S.-based Applied Materials (AMAT) or Dutch company ASML (ASML), local gear manufacturers including Hanmi Semiconductor and Jusung Engineering still make up a vital part of the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.
Meanwhile, Nvidia's (NVDA) partner SK Hynix intends to invest about $4B to set up an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, according to a report from last month. The project is expected to get tax incentives and other types of support in the U.S.

Radio Free Asia, a U.S.-government funded broadcast and online news operation, has closed its editorial office in Hong Kong. The company said on Friday that it has shut down its bureau as a reaction to the new Article 23 National Security Law which came into effect on March 23. RFA will keep its media registration in the city.
The law, which is addition to the National Security Law injected into Hong Kong’s mini constitution in July 2020, imposes severe punishments for interference by foreign forces deemed to threaten national security and criminalizes the possession or disclosure of state secrets. These can include economic and social issues. It also criminalizes sedition.
The Hong Kong government has criticized RFA, the BBC and other news organizations for their reporting about the new law. It says that it was its constitutional duty to enact the new law, rejects claims that Article 23 restricts personal freedoms or is substantially different from security laws in other developed territories.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,185,North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile,"North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Tuesday in a possible test of a new rocket using solid fuel, drawing swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States. South Korea's military said it detected what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from an area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Tuesday at 6:53 a.m. (2153 GMT on Monday) before plunging into the sea off the east coast.
It flew about 600 km (372 miles) before falling into sea, South Korea said, while Japan's defence ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650 km (400 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 100 km (62 miles). South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile or what type of warhead it may have carried, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said the launch was probably ""related"" to the testing of a recent solid-fuel engine. In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch as damaging for regional and international peace and stability. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the event did not pose an immediate danger to its troops or allies but condemned it as an unlawful and destabilizing act.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North could try to sow confusion in his country ahead of a parliamentary election this month. He said such an attempt would be futile and that the response to any North Korean aggression would be firm. U.S. B-52 BOMBER JOINS DRILLS
Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation. On Tuesday, aircraft from the three countries conducted air drills that involved a U.S. B-52H strategic bomber to enhance deterrence and counter capabilities against missile and nuclear threats from the North, South Korea said.
Officials in the United States, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations. South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the United States government is arranging a summit between President Joe Biden and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in July on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington, Japanese media outlets reported.

North Korea reportedly test-fired an intermediate range ballistic missile in the Sea of Japan. Source: AP
South Korea on Tuesday said that neighbouring North Korea had test-fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). According to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
It flew roughly 600 kilometres and landed in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Here’s a look at what ballistic missiles are and how much of a threat they pose.
What are ballistic missiles?
Ballistic missiles are projectiles that are powered by rocket engine(s) until they reach the highest point in their trajectory. From then on, it follows an unpowered trajectory, arching upwards before falling (due to the earth’s gravity) to reach its target.
How dangerous are ballistic missiles?
These missiles are capable of carrying conventional warheads, such as TNT. They can also carry non-conventional warheads, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
They can deliver these payloads at high speed and over great distances. In fact, warheads delivered by these missiles can travel at speeds of 3,200 kilometres per hour right before impact.

Types of ballistic missiles
Ballistic missiles can be classified on the basis of the distances they can travel. According to this classification, there are four kinds of ballistic missiles:
Short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs): Also known as “tactical” ballistic missiles, SRBMs travel less than 1,000 kms.
Medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs): They travel between 1,000 and 3,000 kms. These are also sometimes referred to as “theatre” ballistic missiles.
Intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs): These travel between 3,000 and 5,500 kms. South Korea says that the one test-fired by North Korea on Tuesday was an IRBM.
Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs): This long-range ballistic missile is capable of hitting targets that are over 5,500 kms away from the launch point.
North Korea’s IRBMs
According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Pyongyang has two IRBMs:
Hwasong-12: Also known as KN-17, this missile is believed to have a range of 2,000-4,500 kms. It can carry a single warhead weighing upto 500 kilograms. It was first successfully tested in May 2017. North Korea has flight tested the Hwasong-12 at least seven times, achieving four successful flights and three failures. It is unclear if North Korea has operationally deployed the missile.

BM-25 Musudan: This IRBM is also known as Hwasong-10, Mirim, and Nodong B, BM-25. It is believed to have a range of 2,500 – 4,000 kms, and can carry a payload weighing 500 – 1,200 kgs. BM-25 Musudan could pose a risk to Japan as well as Guam, an unincorporated territory of the United States.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,187,"What are solid-fuel missiles, and why is North Korea developing them?","SEOUL - North Korea launched a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) on April 2, in what South Korean officials said could be related to its development of a new solid-fuel hypersonic weapon.
The launch comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported in March.
In January, North Korea test-fired an IRBM that it said was equipped with a hypersonic manoeuvrable controlled warhead. State media did not immediately disclose details of April 2’s launch.
Here are some characteristics of solid-fuel technology, and how it can help the nuclear-armed North improve its missile systems:
What are some advantages of solid fuel?
Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fuelled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate, and require less logistical support, making them harder to detect and more survivable than liquid-fuel weapons.
“These capabilities are much more responsive in a time of crisis,” said Mr Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
What is solid-fuel technology?
Solid propellants are a mixture of fuel and oxidiser. Metallic powders such as aluminium often serve as the fuel, and ammonium perchlorate, which is the salt of perchloric acid and ammonia, is the most common oxidiser.
The fuel and oxidiser are bound together by a hard, rubbery material and packed into a metal casing.
When solid propellant burns, oxygen from the ammonium perchlorate combines with aluminium to generate enormous amounts of energy and temperatures of more than 2,760 deg C, creating thrust and lifting the missile from the launch pad.
Who has that technology?
Solid fuel dates back to fireworks developed by the Chinese centuries ago, but made dramatic progress in the mid-20th century, when the US developed more powerful propellants.
North Korea uses solid fuel in a range of small, shorter-range ballistic missiles, as well as in its new Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
The Soviet Union fielded its first solid-fuel ICBM, the RT-2, in the early 1970s, followed by France’s development of its S3, also known as SSBS, a medium-range ballistic missile.
China started testing solid-fuel ICBMs in the late 1990s.
South Korea has also said it has secured “efficient and advanced” solid-propellant ballistic missile technology, though in much smaller rockets so far.
Solid v liquid
Liquid propellants provide greater propulsive thrust and power, but require more complex technology and extra weight.
Solid fuel is dense and burns quite quickly, generating thrust over a short time. Solid fuel can remain in storage for an extended period without degrading or breaking down – a common issue with liquid fuel.
North Korea said the development of its solid-fuel ICBM, the Hwasong-18, would “radically promote” its nuclear counter-attack capability.
After the first launch South Korea’s Defence Ministry sought to downplay the testing, saying the North would need “extra time and effort” to master the technology.

In the bond market, Treasury yields spurted higher after a report said U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly returned to growth last month. It snapped a 16-month run of contraction, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
It's the latest evidence showing the U.S. economy remains strong despite high interest rates. That's a positive for the stock market because it can drive growth in profits for companies. But it can also keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could mean a more hesitant Federal Reserve when it comes to the cuts to interest rates that investors crave.
Advertisement
Following the manufacturing data, traders on Wall Street briefly trimmed bets on the first cut to rates coming as soon as June. That's still a “reasonable baseline"" expectation, according to Deutsche Bank economists, but they say tough talk from Fed officials recently could hint at interest rates staying higher for longer than earlier thought.
The Fed has hiked its main rate to the highest level since 2001 in order to slow the economy and depress investment prices enough to get inflation under control. Expectations for coming cuts have been a major reason the S&P 500 soared more than 20% from October through March.

This week will offer several economic reports that could sway the Fed's thinking, including updates on job openings across the country and the strength of U.S. services businesses. The headliner arrives on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that hiring cooled a bit last month.
A slowdown would be welcome on Wall Street, where the hope is that the economy remains solid but not so strong that it pushes inflation higher. Inflation is milder than it was at its peak nearly two years ago. But progress has become bumpier recently, with reports this year coming in hotter than expected.

Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained less than 0.1% to 7,900.50, despite its manufacturing sector index contracting to 47.3 in March from 47.8 in February, its fastest pace since May 2020.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 dipped 0.2% from its all-time high to finish at 5,243.77 on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% from its record to 39,566.85. The Nasdaq composite was an outlier and added 0.1% to 16,396.83.
FedEx fell 3.3% after it said it did not extend its contract with the U.S. Postal Service to deliver air cargo domestically, which will end Sept. 29. Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, lost more than a fifth of its value in another frenetic day of trading.
Universal Health Services sank 4% for one of the S&P 500’s larger losses. It said a jury in Illinois awarded $535 million in damages to a patient who alleged negligence in a sexual-assault case involving another patient.
Helping to keep the losses in check was Newmont. The miner's stock rose 1.6% as the price of gold continues to set records.
In the bond market, Treasury yields spurted higher after a report said U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly returned to growth last month. It snapped a 16-month run of contraction, according to the Institute for Supply Management.
It's the latest evidence showing the U.S. economy remains strong despite high interest rates. That's a positive for the stock market because it can drive growth in profits for companies. But it can also keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could mean a more hesitant Federal Reserve when it comes to the cuts to interest rates that investors crave.
Following the manufacturing data, traders on Wall Street briefly trimmed bets on the first cut to rates coming as soon as June. That's still a “reasonable baseline"" expectation, according to Deutsche Bank economists, but they say tough talk from Fed officials recently could hint at interest rates staying higher for longer than earlier thought.
The Fed has hiked its main rate to the highest level since 2001 in order to slow the economy and depress investment prices enough to get inflation under control. Expectations for coming cuts have been a major reason the S&P 500 soared more than 20% from October through March.
This week will offer several economic reports that could sway the Fed's thinking, including updates on job openings across the country and the strength of U.S. services businesses. The headliner arrives on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that hiring cooled a bit last month.
A slowdown would be welcome on Wall Street, where the hope is that the economy remains solid but not so strong that it pushes inflation higher. Inflation is milder than it was at its peak nearly two years ago. But progress has become bumpier recently, with reports this year coming in hotter than expected.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,190,North Korea fires medium-range ballistic missile,"SEOUL: North Korea fired a medium-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, Seoul's military said, the latest in a spate of banned weapons tests by Kim Jong Un's regime this year.
Tuesday's launch was the third ballistic missile test of 2024, after a solid-fuel one overseen by Kim in March and another tipped with a maneuverable hypersonic warhead in January.
It also comes less than two weeks after Kim supervised an engine test for a ""new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,"" according to North Korean state media, which has also said he oversaw ""super large"" rocket launcher drills and tank exercises this year.
Seoul's military ""detected around 06:53 (2153 GMT) what is presumed to be a medium-range ballistic missile fired from Pyongyang area into the East Sea,"" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
The missile flew about 600 kilometers (373 miles) before splashing down, the JCS said, adding it had ""stepped up monitoring and are closely sharing relevant information with the US and Japan.""

""We strongly condemn the North's blatant provocation that threatens peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,"" it added.
Tokyo confirmed the missile launch, with its coastguard urging vessels to be vigilant and report any fallen objects without approaching them.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the missile appeared ""to have fallen in waters outside Japan's exclusive economic zone.""
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the North had ""repeatedly launched ballistic missiles"" this year, adding that it was a threat to regional security and ""absolutely unacceptable.""
Tuesday's launch likely involved a hypersonic warhead, a Seoul military official told the Yonhap news agency.
""North Korea appears to have put a hypersonic warhead on top of the delivery system used in the engine test last month,"" the official said.
Advertisement
He added that while the missile flew for ""less than 10 minutes,"" its speed was similar to that of a hypersonic model.
Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds of at least Mach 5 — five times the speed of sound — and can maneuver mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.
Depending on their design, they can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads.
The launch comes just days after a Russian veto at the United Nations ended UN expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations, amid a probe into alleged arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.

North Korea has yet to comment on the development.
It also comes just over a week before South Korea votes in a general election, in which the party of hawkish President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a tough line with Pyongyang, is seeking to win back control of the parliament.

Sanctions monitoring?
""The Kim regime prioritizes advancing its military capabilities and doesn't care to stay quiet during the South Korean legislative election campaign,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

""But firing an intermediate-range missile lacks the shock value of a full-range ICBM launch or a nuclear test, so it's unlikely to swing any National Assembly seats.""
Pyongyang has been under a raft of sanctions since its second nuclear test in 2009, but the development of its nuclear and weapons programs has continued unabated.
So far this year, the nuclear-armed North has declared South Korea its ""principal enemy,"" jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over ""even 0.001 mm"" of territorial infringement.
The Tuesday launch ""appears to be part of Pyongyang's missile development blueprint, including hypersonic weapons,"" said Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies.

It seems Kim is developing such technology domestically, rather than with Russian help ""given the sensitive nature of the weapons,"" he added.
Pyongyang has recently boosted ties with traditional ally Russia.
In September last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim held a summit in Russia's far east, during which Kim declared that ties with Moscow were his country's ""number one priority"".
The United States subsequently claimed Pyongyang had begun providing Moscow with weapons.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,191,Korean Fusion Reactor Sets New Record For Sustaining 100 Million Degree Plasma,"Upgrades to Korea's 'artificial Sun' fusion reactor have produced another record-breaking result, with new components able to better withstand blistering temperatures and sustain a swirling ball of 100 million-degree plasma for almost 50 seconds.
It's a leap of close to 20 seconds from the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research reactor (KSTAR), which has been smashing its own records in recent years for how long it can generate and contain insanely hot plasma in its donut-shaped hull.
At 100 million degrees Celsius, heavy hydrogen isotopes in the plasma (a hot cloud of ionized gas) are forced to fuse together, releasing energy in a fashion that's similar to what's happening in the Sun's core. However, the challenge for nuclear fusion – which promises cleaner, near-limitless energy – is to contain this writhing loop of plasma using magnetic fields.
KSTAR's latest result is impressive because it confronts some key challenges in the road to fusion power, although other fusion reactors in the same class of technology have pushed the limits further.
By test-driving the new components, KSTAR is paving the way for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) – which could be the world's largest tokamak fusion reactor if it can overcome budget blow-outs and technical hurdles.
KSTAR's new record – announced by the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE) last week – stems from upgrades made in 2023 to the reactor's divertor, a component that handles the hottest temperatures inside the reactor while funneling waste products away.
KSTAR's divertor is now made of tungsten, which has a very high melting point but doesn't absorb the plasma fuel like a sponge or react with it the way the previous carbon-based divertors would.
Installation of the new divertors was completed last year, helping to extend KSTAR's record fusion time to 48 seconds in its latest 3-month run, up from half a minute in 2021.
""Despite being the first experiment run in the environment of the new tungsten divertors, thorough hardware testing and campaign preparation enabled us to achieve results surpassing those of previous KSTAR records in a short period,"" Si-Woo Yoon, director of the KSTAR Research Center, explained in a statement.
However, the divertor's performance at temperatures seven times that of the Sun had to be proven; it was by no means a sure thing.
The KFE researchers expected it to perform much like a carbon-based divertor, but there was a risk the tungsten could shatter or that the new set-up would fail to generate plasma. Not only had the material of the divertor changed, but also its shape.
""At the beginning of the campaign, the temperature of the inner wall of the tokamak did not rise well,"" says KFE physicist Hyunseok Kim, but the researchers were able to quickly adjust to the new operating conditions to wrangle the plasma with magnetic fields.
The tungsten divertor wasn't the only upgrade helping to improve KSTAR's performance, either. KFE researchers, collaborating with the US Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and writing in Nature Communications in February, described how they found a way to stabilize weaknesses at the edge of the plasma caused by minuscule defects in the magnetic coils that hold the plasma in place.
The improvement led to a second milestone – containing plasma in a highly-efficient state called a high-confinement or 'H-mode' for 102 seconds. Previous attempts were limited to a few seconds before performance dipped dramatically.
Ideally, a fully operational fusion power station would operate at critical temperatures in H-mode for periods long enough to generate a sustainable source of energy. These achievements represent a monumental step towards this goal.
Hyeon-seon Han, a plasma physicist in KFE's High-Performance Scenario Research Team, says the team are currently reviewing this latest batch of experimental data, which will feed into ITER's preparations, assembling their results for publication, and planning their next campaign.
Han hopes that soon they can break through the 50-second mark on their way to the project's ultimate goal of achieving 300 seconds of plasma operation with temperatures over 100 million degrees by the end of 2026.
That's six times longer than KSTAR's current record, and still minutes shorter than China's Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) reactor, which as of April last year, could generate and sustain plasma for almost seven minutes.
But it takes massive amounts of energy to power up fusion reactors and generate plasma reactions for even a few seconds – so their ability to generate plentiful clean energy is still several decades away.",2024-04-02 06:11:14,https://www.sciencealert.com,ScienceAlert,191,artificial sun fusion reactor produced another result new able better withstand blistering sustain ball 100 plasma almost 50 leap close 20 korea advanced research reactor smashing recent long generate contain insanely hot plasma 100 million heavy hydrogen plasma hot cloud gas forced fuse together energy fashion thats similar whats happening core however challenge nuclear fusion cleaner energy contain writhing loop plasma magnetic latest result impressive key road fusion power although fusion class technology new paving way international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter could fusion reactor overcome budget technical new record korea institute fusion energy last week made 2023 divertor component inside reactor waste divertor made tungsten high melting point doesnt absorb plasma fuel like sponge react way previous new last year helping extend record fusion time 48 latest 3month run half minute 2021despite first experiment run environment new tungsten thorough hardware testing campaign preparation u achieve surpassing previous short period director research center performance seven time sun proven sure perform much like divertor risk tungsten could shatter new setup would fail generate plasma material divertor also beginning campaign temperature inner wall rise well physicist kim able quickly adjust new operating wrangle plasma magnetic tungsten divertor wasnt upgrade helping improve performance either u department plasma physic laboratory writing nature found way stabilize edge plasma minuscule magnetic hold plasma improvement led second milestone plasma state 102 previous limited performance dipped fully operational fusion power station would operate critical long enough generate sustainable source energy represent monumental step towards han plasma physicist scenario research team team currently latest batch experimental data feed publication next soon break 50second mark way ultimate goal 300 plasma operation 100 million end 2026thats six time longer current record still shorter experimental advanced east reactor last year could generate sustain plasma almost seven massive energy power fusion generate plasma even ability generate plentiful clean energy still several away fusion reactor new record sustaining 100 million degree plasma
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,192,South Korea says North Korea fired missile into its eastern waters,"A news programme airs a file image of a missile launch by North Korea at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea on Tuesday. Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP
North Korea on Tuesday test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile towards waters off its eastern coast, South Korea’s military said.
South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, but it did not immediately confirm how far the weapon flew.
The North had said last month that it tested a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile, which, if perfected, could reach the US Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18th, when leader Kim Jong-Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.

Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment from the country’s defence ministry stating that the missile had already landed but urging caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile has been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security”.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen since 2022 as Mr Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons.
The US and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets. There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the US and South Korea.
Following the March 19th test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Mr Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time. Mr Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm its adversaries’ missile defence systems.
In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic, manoeuvrable warhead, which came after it tested a solid-fuel IRBM engine for the first time in November.
Other weapons North Korea have tested this year include cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at the Seoul capital area.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions.
South Korea’s military said on Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the north-west.
Mr Kim has described satellites as crucial for monitoring US and South Korean military movements and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles.
Last November, North Korea put a military spy satellite into orbit for the first time, drawing condemnations from the US, South Korea, Japan and others, which view the launch as a cover for testing the North’s long-range missile technology.
North Korea has argued it has the sovereign right to launch spy satellites. - AP",2024-04-02 05:54:00,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times,192,news file image missile launch north korea railway station south korea photograph korea suspected ballistic missile towards eastern coast south military joint staff said missile area near north capital immediately confirm far weapon north said last month tested engine new type hypersonic missile perfected could reach u pacific military hub first known launch event since march 18th leader kim drill artillery designed target south coast guard assessment defence ministry missile already landed urging caution passing prime minister told damage related missile said north frequent missile threaten peace safety japan also region international peninsula risen since 2022 kim used invasion distraction accelerate testing u south korea expanding combined training trilateral japan deterrence built around strategic u asset north korea could dial pressure election year u south march 19th test engine kim said strategic value would important intercontinental ballistic u recent north korea solid easier move hide made launch need stay long time kim also vowed acquire hypersonic overwhelm missile defence north korea said new ballistic missile tipped hypersonic came tested engine first time north korea tested year include cruise multiple rocket capital latest launch came two day north korea launch several reconnaissance year violation multiple un security council military said satellite launch impending main launch facility kim crucial u south military threat north korea put military spy satellite orbit first time drawing u south korea japan view launch cover testing missile korea sovereign right launch spy south korea north korea fired missile eastern
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,193,Seoul says Pyongyang launched ballistic missile towards Sea of Japan,"Near the US-Canada border in Burlington, Vermont, which is set to experience the totality just before 3:30 pm (1930 GMT), many hotels have been sold out for months.
The few remaining rooms, which typically go for around $150 a night, show online prices of $600-$700 for the night of the eclipse.
""I don't know that we'll have anything quite like this again,"" Jeff Lawson, a vice president in the chamber of commerce, told AFP.
Lawson marveled at his city's ""incredible luck"" at an opportunity ""quite literally falling out of the sky into your lap.""
If skies are clear, the small city of 40,000 could see its population double for the day, with visitors arriving by car, train and even private jet, Lawson said.
An estimated 32 million people live inside the ""path of totality"" -- under which the Moon will fully block out the Sun -- with an additional 150 million residing less than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from the strip, NASA says.
- Traffic jams -
Preparations for the big day began years ago, Matt Bruning of the Ohio Department of Transportation told AFP.
He said the agency reached out to counterparts along the last major US eclipse, in 2017, and ""one of the things that we heard resoundingly was it's never too early to start planning.""
Despite those efforts, there will inevitably ""be delays, there will be heavy congestion,"" he warned.
Businesses are leaping into the bonanza with special events and in Cleveland, where local officials expect some 200,000 visitors, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame plans a four-day ""Solarfest"" of live music.
The Perryman Group, a Texas-based research firm, estimates direct and indirect economic impacts of this year's eclipse could reach $6 billion.
This year's path of totality is about 115 miles wide, wider than in 2017. It begins in western Mexico, arches up through the US cities of Dallas, Indianapolis, and Buffalo, before ending in eastern Canada.
Many schools along the path will be closed or letting students out early, including in Cleveland and Montreal.
Several airlines have advertised flights scheduled to pass under the eclipse, while Delta has even planned two special trips along the path of totality, the first of which sold out in 24 hours, the company said.
NASA warns that only in the path of totality -- and only during the few minutes of the actual totality -- is it safe to look at the eclipse without eye protection.
- 'Cosmic coincidence' -
Almost all of the United States will get to experience a partial eclipse, but UCLA astronomer Jean-Luc Margot says the trip to see the totality is definitely worth the hassle.
""If you have a 99 percent partial eclipse, that is a completely different experience than being in the path of totality,"" he told AFP.
He will be accompanying a group of UCLA alumni to view the eclipse in rural Texas, after similar trips in 2017 to Oregon and to Chile in 2019.
When people finally see the eclipse, they ""tend to be emotional,"" Margot said.
""It is such a beautiful event. It's due to this complete cosmic coincidence, that the angular size of the Sun and the angular size of the Moon are about the same.""
Scientists have traditionally used the eclipses to observe the solar corona, an outer layer of plasma that's difficult to study due to the Sun's bright light, Margot said.
New tools such as the space-based Parker Solar Probe have made such research less eclipse-dependent, but scientists will still be taking full advantage.
NASA recently highlighted several studies being planned for the eclipse, from effects on Earth's atmosphere and animal behavior to even human psychology.
""Eclipses have a special power,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said recently.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,194,Japan approves $3.9 billion in subsidies to domestic chip maker Rapidus,"Japan said Tuesday it has approved up to 590 billion yen ($3.89 billion) in additional subsidies for chipmaker Rapidus Corporation, as the country plays catch up with other nations on semiconductor manufacturing.
The latest round of support will include up to 53.5 billion yen for research and development of back-end processes such as chip packaging, according to a press briefing by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on Tuesday.
Rapidus Corporation was founded in 2022 by the Japanese government and eight domestic companies to develop and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Toyota Motor Corporation, Sony Group are among the companies that have invested billions of yen in Rapidus.
Rapidus has received 330 billion yen from the Japanese government between 2022 and 2023 to mass produce 2-nanometer chips in Chitose, Hokkaido, from 2027.
It will compete with industry leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, which plan to start mass production of 2-nanometer chips by 2025.
TSMC and Samsung currently produce 3-nanometer chips, while Rapidus is currently constructing an advanced semiconductor plant in Chitose.
Typically, a reduction in nanometer size can yield more powerful and efficient chips with more transistors packed onto a single semiconductor.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,195,"North Korea tests missile, Seoul says, ahead of vote seen as gauge of support for hardline South Korean leader","Seoul, South Korea CNN —
North Korea test-fired a presumed intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, its latest military maneuver since leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year declaration that he was ending a policy seeking reconciliation with the South.
Pyongyang made no immediate comment on the suspected test, which comes just over a week before key legislative elections in South Korea that will provide a barometer of support for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line against the North during his two years in office.
North Korea, which has faced years of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, has ramped up its weapons tests and military exercises in recent weeks.
On March 19, Pyongyang said it had tested a multistage, solid-fueled rocket engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Kim said after that test the development of the IRBM system was as important to North Korea’s security as its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which in theory could reach the United States mainland.
The KCNA report on the engine test did not give further details of the new hypersonic weapon, but North Korea has previously said it tested a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).
While all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic velocity – five to 10 times the speed of sound – in their terminal phase, an HGV can maneuver at high speeds as it nears a target, enabling it to evade detection and missile defenses.

Meanwhile, North Korea’s military has staged a series of military exercises in the past few months as the US and South Korea also held drills, including their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which South Korea said focused on deterring the North’s nuclear threat.
Pyongyang’s shows of power included long-range artillery and multiple rocket launchers, which pose a threat to the South Korean capital Seoul and other key areas near the border.
Ahead of the April 10 vote, some polls show President Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) widely trailing the opposition Democratic Party – and a loss for the PPP could be seen to weaken Yoon’s leadership, analysts say.
Yoon, who has pushed for increased military cooperation with the US, also backs closer ties with Korea’s former colonial ruler Japan, angering many in a country where the scars of that occupation remain prominent.
But Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Tuesday’s suspected missile test by North Korea won’t have much effect on the vote.
Video Ad Feedback How much damage can North Korea's weapons do? 01:07 - Source: CNN
“Firing an intermediate-range missile lacks the shock value of a full-range ICBM launch or a nuclear test, so it’s unlikely to swing any National Assembly seats,” Easley said.
South Koreans are more focused on domestic problems like healthcare reform and economic troubles, Easley added.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,196,"North Korea tests missile, Seoul says, ahead of vote seen as gauge of support for hardline South Korean leader","By Brad Lendon, CNN
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) — North Korea test-fired a presumed intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, its latest military maneuver since leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year declaration that he was ending a policy seeking reconciliation with the South.
Pyongyang made no immediate comment on the suspected test, which comes just over a week before key legislative elections in South Korea that will provide a barometer of support for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line against the North during his two years in office.
North Korea, which has faced years of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, has ramped up its weapons tests and military exercises in recent weeks.
On March 19, Pyongyang said it had tested a multistage, solid-fueled rocket engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Kim said after that test the development of the IRBM system was as important to North Korea’s security as its intercontinental ballistic missiles, which in theory could reach the United States mainland.
The KCNA report on the engine test did not give further details of the new hypersonic weapon, but North Korea has previously said it tested a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV).
While all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic velocity – five to 10 times the speed of sound – in their terminal phase, an HGV can maneuver at high speeds as it nears a target, enabling it to evade detection and missile defenses.
Meanwhile, North Korea’s military has staged a series of military exercises in the past few months as the US and South Korea also held drills, including their annual Freedom Shield exercise, which South Korea said focused on deterring the North’s nuclear threat.
Pyongyang’s shows of power included long-range artillery and multiple rocket launchers, which pose a threat to the South Korean capital Seoul and other key areas near the border.
Ahead of the April 10 vote, some polls show President Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) widely trailing the opposition Democratic Party – and a loss for the PPP could be seen to weaken Yoon’s leadership, analysts say.
Yoon, who has pushed for increased military cooperation with the US, also backs closer ties with Korea’s former colonial ruler Japan, angering many in a country where the scars of that occupation remain prominent.
But Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Tuesday’s suspected missile test by North Korea won’t have much effect on the vote.
“Firing an intermediate-range missile lacks the shock value of a full-range ICBM launch or a nuclear test, so it’s unlikely to swing any National Assembly seats,” Easley said.
South Koreans are more focused on domestic problems like healthcare reform and economic troubles, Easley added.
Tuesday’s suspected North Korean missile test also comes less than two weeks before Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida heads to Washington for a trilateral summit with US President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
While the issue of an increasingly assertive China is expected to be front and center at that meeting, North Korea is also likely to be on the agenda for the three leaders.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,197,"Samsung likely to launch super app for financial services, working closely with South Korean banks","Samsung is not allowed to own a bank in South Korea. Consequently, the tech giant has had to go through a collaboration and leverage the infrastructure of an existing bank as its partner.

Although Samsung is involved in the financial sector in South Korea, they are not allowed to own a bank. Image Credit: Reuters
Having dominated everything tech for years, Samsung now wants to be a financial institution. The South Korean giant is now gearing up to make its mark in the commercial banking system in South Korea and quite possibly, other countries in Asia, with the launch of a new super app, if recent South Korean news reports are anything to go by.

The move signifies Samsung’s ambitious venture into financial services, through which it hopes to transform its existing financial app, Momino, into a comprehensive super app, similar to what we see in China’s WeChat platform.
The endeavour is led by Samsung Financial Networks, a division which includes the conglomerate’s four financial entities: Samsung Card, Samsung Life Insurance, Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, and Samsung Securities. A report by The Korea Economic Daily claims that Samsung is actively seeking collaboration with at least one prominent bank in South Korea to develop and deploy their new super app.
The report quotes sources, who opted to remain anonymous, revealing that Samsung has started an initial round of discussions with five leading banks, namely KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and the digital-exclusive K Bank.
These discussions revolve around Samsung’s proposal to enhance its existing Momino app into a multifunctional super app, offering various financial services ranging from money transfers to real estate and car price comparisons.

Sources also told The Korea Economic Daily that banks are supposed to meet with executives from Samsung on Tuesday where they are slated to present their proposals to Samsung. Furthermore, the decision on a potential partnership can be expected as early as Wednesday.
Despite its global stature and ownership of multiple financial affiliates, Samsung is barred from owning a bank in South Korea. Consequently, the tech giant has had to go for a collaborative approach and leverage the infrastructure of a banking partner while providing software support and integrating its financial services.

Samsung’s foray into the commercial banking sector signals a strategic shift aimed at diversifying its service portfolio and tapping into new revenue streams. With the impending launch of its super app, Samsung is poised to make substantial strides in reshaping the landscape of digital financial services in South Korea.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,198,U.S. pushes South Korea to follow its lead and tighten export controls on chips for China,"The US is asking South Korea to adopt restrictions on semiconductor technology exports to China similar to those Washington has already implemented, another sign the Biden administration is stepping up efforts to thwart Beijing’s chip ambitions.
American officials want South Korea to restrict the flow of equipment and technologies for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include logic chips more advanced than 14-nanometer and a type of memory called DRAM beyond 18nm, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. That would be consistent with a set of measures the US Department of Commerce first announced in 2022.
American officials discussed the issues in depth with the government of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in March, the people said. While the US is trying to reach an agreement before a G7 summit in mid-June, Seoul officials are debating whether to satisfy the US request, in part because China remains a key trading partner.
Washington’s request of South Korea has not been detailed before. This comes on top of the new US push to get allies to limit servicing of semiconductor equipment for Chinese firms and restrict exports of spare parts and chip chemicals to China.
Bloomberg News has reported the US pressed allies, including South Korea and Germany, to tighten curbs on China’s access to their technology. Korea plays a leading role in producing semiconductors and providing spare parts for chip-making equipment.
The timeline could slip. South Korea, Japan and US officials are planning to meet in late June to discuss cooperation on advanced technology and supply chains, according to the people.
South Korean officials are wary of potential penalties that export controls may trigger from Beijing when major firms such as Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. still operate in China, Seoul’s largest trading partner.
The US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security did not respond to requests for comment. South Korea’s Trade Ministry declined to comment.
With help from Samsung and Hynix, South Korea makes some of the world’s most advanced logic and memory chips. While its chip equipment suppliers are not as prominent as the US’s Applied Materials Inc. or the Netherlands’ ASML Holding NV, local gear makers including Hanmi Semiconductor Co. and Jusung Engineering Co. still make up an important part of the Asian country’s semiconductor ecosystem.
South Korea has the biggest market share of memory chips in China and it is the second largest provider of silicon wafers for Chinese firms after Japan, according to a February report from the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. For chip-making materials and parts, South Korea is also the second largest exporter to China after Japan, the report said.
Meanwhile, South Korea is tapping into a multinational framework to review export controls for sensitive products like semiconductor-related equipment, the country’s trade minister Cheong Inkyo told reporters last month, an approach that may complicate US efforts to curtail China’s influence on technology supply chains. It will take months for South Korea to implement any curbs, the official added.",2024-04-02 04:00:00,https://fortune.com,Fortune,198,u south korea adopt semiconductor technology china similar already another sign administration stepping thwart chip want south korea restrict flow equipment making logic memory chip china according people familiar matter include logic chip advanced 14nanometer type memory dram beyond 18nm one people said private would consistent set u department commerce first 2022american depth government south president march people said u trying reach agreement g7 summit debating whether satisfy u request part china remains key trading request south korea detailed come top new u push get ally limit semiconductor equipment restrict spare chip news u ally south korea tighten access technology korea leading role providing spare could slip south korea japan u meet late june discus advanced technology supply according wary potential export may trigger major electronics still operate china trading u department bureau industry security respond comment south trade ministry declined help south korea advanced logic memory chip chip equipment prominent applied holding local gear semiconductor engineering still make important part semiconductor korea biggest market share memory chip china second provider silicon japan according report korea institute international economic policy south korea also second exporter china japan report south korea tapping multinational framework review export sensitive like equipment trade minister told last month approach may complicate u curtail influence technology supply take south korea implement official added u south korea follow lead tighten export chip china
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,199,"North Korea fires an intermediate-range missile, South Korea says","SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast Tuesday, South Korea’s military said, as it pushes to advance its weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and flew about 372 miles before landing in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the launch most likely followed up on a North Korean test in March of a solid-fuel engine built for a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile it has been developing. If perfected, such weapons could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond, experts say.
Lee did not specify why the South Koreans were assessing the missile as an IRBM or whether it was flown at less than its capacity, but said the North Koreans were most likely experimenting with new warhead technologies.
Japan’s Defense Ministry gave more details in its assessment, saying the missile flew about 403 miles while reaching a maximum altitude of 62 miles before landing in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone. The Japanese military did not immediately say whether it assessed the missile as intermediate range or something else.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile had been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security.”
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
Following the March 19 test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the U.S. mainland.
In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants. Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fueled before launch and cannot stay fueled for long periods of time.
Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm his adversaries’ missile defense systems. Other weapons North Korea has tested this year include cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at Seoul, the capital of South Korea.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year. South Korea’s military said Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the northwest.
Kim has described satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military movements and enhancing the threat of his nuclear-capable missiles.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,200,North Korea fires intermediate-range ballistic missile into East Sea,"A TV report shows North Korea's ballistic missile launch at Seoul Station in the capital on Tuesday. The missile flew around 375 miles before splashing down in the East Sea, defense officials said. Photo by Yonhap
SEOUL, April 2 (UPI) -- North Korea launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile into the East Sea Tuesday, South Korea's military said, the latest in a slew of weapons tests by the isolated regime this year. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters that it detected a projectile presumed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile fired from the Pyongyang area at 6:53 a.m. Advertisement
The missile flew around 375 miles before splashing down in the East Sea, the JCS said.
""Our military immediately detected, tracked and monitored the launch of a North Korean missile and closely shared related information with the U.S. and Japan,"" the JCS said. ""Detailed specifications are being comprehensively analyzed.""
Hawaii-based U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said it was aware of the launch and was consulting with South Korea and Japan.
""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" the command said in a statement, using the official name of North Korea. ""While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation.""

The launch was the North's third ballistic missile of the year among a range of weapons tests and heated rhetoric that has kept tensions ratcheted up on the Korean Peninsula.
On March 20, Pyongyang announced that it successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for a new type of hypersonic missile, and South Korean defense officials said that Tuesday's launch may have been a trial of the new delivery system.
""We believe [the launch] is related to the solid-fuel ground test that North Korea publicly reported in March,"" JCS spokesman Col. Lee Sung-jun said at a press briefing.
Hypersonic weapons travel at least five times the speed of sound and are designed to be maneuverable, making them difficult to intercept. In January, Pyongyang said it test-fired a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with a hypersonic warhead, which could place U.S. military installations in Guam -- around 2,100 miles away -- within reach.
Lee said Tuesday's launch showed ""some similarities and some differences"" with the January test and added that further analysis was required.
""There is a possibility that the launch vehicle's capabilities have been enhanced,"" he said.
A hypersonic missile was among a wish list of weapons that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un laid out at a party congress in January 2021, alongside nuclear-powered submarines, submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, ""ultramodern tactical nuclear weapons"" and military satellites.

On Monday, a North Korean official announced that Pyongyang planned to place several spy satellites into orbit this year.
Tuesday's launch comes amid growing military ties between North Korea and Russia, with evidence that Moscow is sharing advanced weapons technology and helping Pyongyang evade sanctions in exchange for munitions. Russia last week used its veto power to end a U.N. Security Council group that monitors sanctions violations by the North.
It also comes about a week ahead of the April 10 general election in South Korea, which defense officials have said may be a target for further provocations from the North.
""Further analysis is needed for [another intermediate-range ballistic missile] launch in the run-up to the general election,"" Lee said. ""There is also a possibility of additional missile launches and the launch of a space launch vehicle from [satellite facility] Tongchang-ri in the future, and we are keeping a close eye on it.

The military in Seoul said that North Korea launched a medium-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, the most recent in a string of prohibited weapon tests conducted by Kim Jong Un’s government this year.
The ballistic missile test on Tuesday was the third of 2024, following a solid-fuel test under Kim’s supervision in March and a test with a manoeuvrable hypersonic warhead in January.

It also coincides with less than two weeks after North Korean state media said that Kim oversaw tank training and “super large” rocket launcher drills this year, in addition to supervising an engine test for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile”.
Seoul’s military “detected around 06:53 (2153 GMT) what is presumed to be a medium-range ballistic missile fired from Pyongyang area into the East Sea,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
“We have stepped up monitoring and are closely sharing relevant information with the US and Japan,” they added.
Tokyo confirmed the missile launch, with the coastguard urging vessels to be vigilant and report any fallen objects without approaching them.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the missile “appears to have fallen in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone”.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the North had “repeatedly launched ballistic missiles” this year, adding that it was a threat to regional security and “absolutely unacceptable.”
The launch comes just days after a Russian veto at the United Nations ended UN expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations, amid a probe into alleged arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.

North Korea has yet to comment on the development.
It also comes just over a week before South Korea votes in a general election, in which the party of hawkish President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a tough line with Pyongyang, is seeking to win back control of the parliament.
Sanctions monitoring?

Pyongyang has been under a raft of sanctions since its second nuclear test in 2009, but the development of its nuclear and weapons programmes has continued unabated.
So far this year, the nuclear-armed North has declared South Korea its “principal enemy”, jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement.

Last month, the United States and South Korea staged one of their major annual joint military exercises, prompting angry retorts and live-fire drills from nuclear-armed Pyongyang, which condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion.
Seoul is one of Washington’s key regional allies, and the United States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South to help protect it against North Korea.
Pyongyang has recently boosted ties with traditional ally Russia.
In September last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim held a summit in Russia’s far east, during which Kim declared that ties with Moscow were his country’s “number one priority”.
The United States subsequently claimed Pyongyang had begun providing Moscow with weapons.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,202,North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile,"North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Tuesday, South Korea's military said, in a move that sparked immediate condemnation from the prime minister of Japan. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it detected the launch of what appeared to be a ballistic missile of an intermediate-range class from the area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Tuesday at 0653 a.m. (2153 GMT on Monday).
It flew about 600 kms (372 miles) before falling into sea, South Korea said, while Japan's defence ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650 km (400 miles) and hit a maximum altitude of 100 km (62 miles). The statement from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.
In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported. Japan said the missile appeared to have fallen outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation. Officials in the United States, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations.
South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea for Tuesday's missile launch that affected the peace and stability of the region, he told reporters.
North Korea recently said it had no interest in a summit with Japan and would reject any talks, potentially worsening already-hostile relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, the United States government is arranging a summit between President Joe Biden and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in July on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington, Japanese media outlets reported.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,206,South Korea says North Korea has fired intermediate range missile into its eastern waters,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Tuesday test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast, South Korea’s military said, adding to a series of weapons demonstrations that have raised tensions in the region.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, but it did not immediately confirm how far the weapon flew. The North had said last month that it tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile as it tries to expand its arsenal of weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area. Japanese broadcaster NHK said the missile likely didn’t reach the country’s exclusive economic zone.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
The weapons North Korea have tested this year include an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to target the U.S. mainland as well as cruise missiles and “super-large” multiple rocket launchers aimed at the Seoul capital area.
The latest launch came two days after North Korea reaffirmed its plans to launch several reconnaissance satellites this year in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea’s military said Monday there were no signs that a satellite launch is impending at the North’s main launch facility in the northwest.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,210,North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range missile,"North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast, South Korea's military said, in a move that sparked immediate condemnation from the prime minister of Japan.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it detected the launch of what appeared to be a ballistic missile of an intermediate-range class from the area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang at 06.53am local time.
It flew about 600km before falling into sea, South Korea said, while Japan's defence ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650km and hit a maximum altitude of 100km.
The statement from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine.
In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported.
Japan said the missile appeared to have fallen outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the US and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation.
Officials in the US, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations.
South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea's foreign ministry said.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Korea for today's missile launch that affected the peace and stability of the region, he told reporters.

The North had said last month that it tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile, which, if perfected, could reach the US Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defence Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile has been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security”.

The United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the United States and South Korea.
Following the March 19 test of the solid-fuel IRBM engine, Mr Kim said the strategic value of such weapons would be just as important as his intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland.

In recent years, North Korea has been focusing on developing more weapons with built-in solid propellants.
Those weapons are easier to move and hide and can be made to launch quicker than liquid-propellant missiles, which need to be fuelled before launch and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time.

Mr Kim has also vowed to acquire hypersonic missiles that can overwhelm its adversaries’ missile defence systems.
In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic, manoeuvrable warhead, which came after it tested a solid-fuel IRBM engine for the first time in November.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,218,Korea’s Hanwha says it is a ‘credible buyer’ for shipbuilder Austal,"Street Talk has previously reported that New York’s JF Lehman & Company, which specialises in investing in complex and regulated sectors, has also been interested in Austal, as has Cerberus Capital Management, a $US60 billion ($88 billion) alternative asset investor. Former treasurer Joe Hockey’s Bondi Partners has also previously expressed interest in putting together a consortium of investors to take Austal private.
Hanwha’s bid for Austal comes as the company aggressively expands into shipbuilding, acquiring a controlling interest in Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, one of South Korea’s three major shipbuilders, last year for $US1.49 billion ($2.24 billion). Daewoo Shipbuilding subsequently changed its name to Hanwha Ocean.
In a statement, Hanwha said it had made the takeover offer for Austal because it was a “known entity” and the acquisition would “build upon the countries’ alliances and support Australia’s national security as a partner and ally”.
“Hanwha believes an Austal acquisition would benefit numerous stakeholders, including
governments, shareholders, employees, and communities and is planning to go through all the proper processes towards a successful sale,” it said.
But Austal said it rejected the bid after assessing “the potential for shareholder value creation, competition concerns and a potential purchaser’s ability to ultimately complete a transaction (which would include necessary government approvals).”
“This latter consideration is particularly relevant in relation to the proposal from Hanwha, given Austal’s position as the designer and builder of defence vessels for the Australian and US navies and ownership clauses associated with defence contracts,” it told investors on Tuesday, adding some contracts required “a commitment to ensuring continuous naval shipbuilding in Australia”.
In December, Austal won a near $1.3 billion contract to design and build three medical ships for the US Navy, taking its order book to more than $11 billion. It is also expected to benefit from a large pool of work that will be available as part of the AUKUS defence pact between Australia, the US and the United Kingdom.

SEOUL – North Korea test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast Tuesday, South Korea’s military said, as it pushes to advance its weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from an area near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and flew about 600 kilometers (372 miles) before landing in the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the launch likely followed up on a North Korean test in March of a solid-fuel engine built for a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile it has been developing. If perfected, such weapons could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam and beyond, experts say.
Lee didn’t specify why the South Koreans were assessing the missile as an IRBM or whether it was flown at less than its capacity, but said the North Koreans were likely experimenting with new warhead technologies.
Japan’s Defense Ministry gave more details in its assessment, saying the missile flew about 650 kilometers (403 miles) while reaching a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles) before landing in waters outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone. The Japanese military didn’t immediately say whether it assessed the missile as intermediate range or something else.
It was the North’s first known launch event since March 18, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of artillery systems designed to target South Korea’s capital.
Japan’s coast guard shared an assessment of the country’s Defense Ministry that the missile has already landed but still urged caution for vessels passing the area.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that no damage related to the missile has been reported. He said North Korea’s frequent missile launches “threaten the peace and safety of not only Japan but also the region and the international security.”
Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,221,North Korea Fires Ballistic Missile Ahead of South’s Election,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least one suspected ballistic missile in a show of force that came just days ahead of national elections in South Korea for parliamentary seats.
North Korea launched an unidentified ballistic missile toward waters off its east coast Tuesday, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a message sent to reporters. The missile likely landed outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, Kyodo News reported citing a government official it did not name. Further details on the launch were not immediately available
This is the third test of ballistic missiles from Kim Jong Un’s regime this year. On March 18, North Korea fired at least six short-range ballistic missiles as the leader oversaw tests of multiple rocket launcher systems.

North Korea has a habit of provocations that coincide with elections in South Korea, which is set for a national vote on April 10. Kim’s regime has bristled at the government of current conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol who has taken a hard line with Pyongyang and the latest launch serves as a reminder of North Korea’s threats to security.
Kim guided military drills last month that included fire from an artillery unit capable of hitting Seoul, stepping up threats against his neighbor that coincided with it holding joint military training with the US.

Pyongyang fired 30 ballistic missiles and three space rockets in 2023. They included five intercontinental ballistic missiles that could hit the US mainland. Kim’s regime launched more than 70 ballistic missiles in 2022, a record for the state.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,222,South Korea’s president vows not to back down in the face of doctors’ strike over medical school plan,"South Korea’s president vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts “an illegal collective action” that poses “a grave threat to our society.”
About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks, causing hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools have also submitted resignations though they haven’t stopped treating patients.
Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes.
Public surveys show that a majority of ordinary South Koreans support the government plan. But observers say many people are increasingly fed up with the protracted confrontation between the government and doctors, threatening to deal a blow to governing party candidates ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections.
In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea’s doctor-to-patient ratio – 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people – is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world.
“Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can’t further delay,” Yoon said.
Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people’s lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains their calls for a much smaller increase in the medical school enrolment quota.
“I can’t tolerate an attempt to carry through their thoughts by force without due logic and grounds,” Yoon said. “The illegal collective action by some doctors has become a grave threat to our society.”
Yoon said the recruitment plan won’t lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world.
Later Monday, the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, criticized Yoon for repeating what his government has already argued to support the recruitment plan.
“It was an address that brought us greater disappointment because we had high hopes” for some changes in the government’s position, Kim Sung-geun, a spokesperson for KMA’s emergency committee, told reporters.
Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn’t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon.
Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon.
It’s unclear if the government and doctors can find a breakthrough to settle their standoff anytime soon. Last week, KMA elected Lim Hyun-taek, a hardliner who has called for a decrease in the medical school admission cap, as its new chief.
After his election Tuesday, Lim said that doctors can sit down for talks with the government if Yoon apologizes and dismisses top health officials involved in the recruitment plan. Lim also threatened to launch an all-out fight if any doctors receive punitive steps over their recent protests.
The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors in South Korea – estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors’ association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30 per cent to 40 per cent of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training.
Doctors say the government enrolment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,223,South Korea's president vows not to back down in the face of doctors' strike,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s president vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts “an illegal collective action” that poses “a grave threat to our society.”
About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks, causing hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools have also submitted resignations though they haven’t stopped treating patients.
Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes.

Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work, saying they have a responsibility to protect people’s lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains why adding 2,000 more students is too steep of an increase.

File Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, April 1 (UPI) -- North Korea said Monday it was on its way to becoming a ""space power"" and vowed to put several more reconnaissance satellites into orbit this year, following its first successful launch in November. ""Great progress has been made in strengthening the national defense capability with the successful launch of the reconnaissance satellite 'Malligyong-1' last year,"" Pak Kyong Su, vice director of the North's National Aerospace Technology Administration said, according to state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""Several reconnaissance satellites are expected to be launched this year as well."" Advertisement
Pak made the comments on the anniversary of the founding of the North's space development agency on April 1.
North Korea has also been working on satellite projects for sectors including agriculture, weather observation, communications, land management and disaster prevention, Pak added.
""The development of the space industry is a key factor in opening up a shortcut to securing the status of a world-class economic, scientific and technological power,"" he said. ""We will surely build a space power by continuing to spur independent space development.""
North Korea successfully placed its Malligyong-1 spy satellite into orbit last November after a pair of failed attempts earlier in the year.

That launch drew scrutiny amid Pyongyang's growing military ties with Moscow following a September visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Russia. The trip included a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a space launch facility.
Seoul and Washington say that Pyongyang has been shipping artillery and equipment to Russia for its war in Ukraine, while the North is believed to be receiving advanced technology for its space and missile programs in return.
South Korea's Unification Ministry, which manages inter-Korean affairs, said Monday that Seoul is monitoring launch sites and key facilities in close coordination with the United States.
""We will not make any predictions about the possibility of launching a military satellite in the future, but will prepare for all possibilities through close cooperation with relevant organizations,"" ministry spokesperson Koo Byung-sam said at a press briefing.
""Regardless of the purpose of the satellites that North Korea claims, any North Korean satellite using ballistic missile technology is a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" he added.
South Korea's military said Monday that it detected no signs of preparations for an impending launch.
""Currently, there are no imminent signs of a reconnaissance satellite launch from the Tongchang-ri launch site,"" Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Col. Lee Sung-joon said at a press briefing. ""South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities have been closely coordinating to monitor and track North Korea's military activities.""",2024-04-01 09:38:09,https://www.upi.com,UPI News,225,north korea said place several spy orbit year following first successful launch leader kim un file photo 1 north korea said way becoming space power vowed put several reconnaissance orbit year following first successful launch great progress made strengthening national defense capability successful launch reconnaissance satellite malligyong1 last year vice director national technology administration said according central news agency several reconnaissance year well made anniversary founding space development agency 1north korea also working satellite agriculture weather observation land management disaster prevention development space industry key factor opening status economic scientific technological power said surely build space power spur independent space korea successfully malligyong1 spy satellite orbit last pair launch drew scrutiny amid growing military following visit north leader kim un russia trip included meeting president space launch say shipping artillery equipment russia war north advanced technology space missile unification ministry said launch key close united make possibility military satellite future prepare close relevant ministry said press purpose north korea north satellite ballistic missile technology clear violation un security council military said impending imminent reconnaissance satellite launch launch site joint staff spokesman col lee said press briefing south u intelligence closely monitor track north military north korea launch several spy year

FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,228,"South Korea’s Export Growth Continues, Supporting Economy","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s exports continued to grow last month, supporting confidence among policymakers that the economy will see a solid first quarter on the back of rising global demand for semiconductors and technology devices.
Average daily shipments increased 9.9% from a year earlier, according to data released Monday by the trade ministry. Without adjustment for the number of working days, headline exports rose 3.1% while overall imports decreased by 12.3%. The trade surplus came to $4.3 billion.
South Korea is among the world’s largest exporters of goods and serves as a bellwether for global commerce. Its dominance in memory chips and smarthphones also makes the nation a barometer for tech demand. The latest figures point to continued recovery in global demand especially in the chip sector.
South Korean exports of chips increased 35.7% from a year earlier in March to $11.7 billion, the largest monthly sales total since March 2022, the ministry said. Display exports rose 16.2% and computer sales increased 24.5%, too, underscoring the momentum that stems from technology demand.
Semiconductor sales have been brisk in recent months, allowing overall exports to rebound. The growth momentum in exports that has carried into this year is one reason authorities expect the South Korean economy to expand faster in 2024 than last year.
Still, the chip recovery will need to be accompanied by a stronger pickup in exports of other products such as automobiles, steel and oil chemicals for authorities to be more certain that the economy will grow more than 2% as they estimate.
Shipments of automobiles fell 5% and those of machinery decreased 10% from a year earlier in March, according to the ministry. Oil products rose 3.1%.
The Goods Trade Barometer managed by the World Trade Organization reached 100.6 last month, slightly above the trend baseline, indicating weak upward momentum in global trade.
“Merchandise trade should continue to recover gradually in the early months of 2024, but any gains could be easily derailed by regional conflicts and geopolitical tensions,"" the global organization said last month.
As a nation that has China as its biggest trading partner and the US as its top security ally, South Korea is among the nations most vulnerable to geopolitical clashes that can weigh on international trade momentum. While US consumer sentiment and spending have remained strong, demand from China has been underwhelming as the world’s second-largest economy struggles to emerge from its property slump.
Adding to risks this year is a series of elections scheduled across a wide swathe of the world that could result in protectionist policies that damage trade-reliant economies like South Korea’s.
The country itself will hold parliamentary elections later this month, in a vote that could influence the degree to which it re-calibrates its relationship with China in the long run.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,229,"India, Korea and Japan to Stay Busy With IPOs While China Stalls","(Bloomberg) -- After the worst quarter in five years for Asia Pacific initial public offerings, a pick up activity is expected from South Korea, India and Japan while Chinese deals are likely to remain sparse.
New share sales across the region fell to $11 billion between January and March, the lowest tally for a quarter since early 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The amount represents a 46% drop from the same period last year.
While IPOs returned to major venues in Europe and the US, the slowdown in Asia was mostly due to Beijing’s decision to ramp up scrutiny of domestic new share sales as it tries to boost confidence in its equities market. Large deals in Hong Kong also vanished amid concerns about to China’s economy. The city hasn’t hosted an offering larger than $1 billion since Oct. 2022.
Syngenta Group withdrew its long-delayed application for a $9 billion initial public offering in Shanghai last week, another blow to China’s equity markets after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. scrapped the listing of its logistics arm.
Elsewhere in the region, new share sales set to raise several hundred million dollars are surfacing. In South Korea, marine services company HD Hyundai Marine Solution Co. and one shareholder are seeking as much as 742 billion won ($551 million) this month. Even priced at the bottom of range, it would the largest IPO in Seoul since early 2022.
India has hosted a flurry of tiny deals since the start of January, drawing scrutiny from regulators during the past month. With demand for equities in the country remaining high, offerings bigger than $100 million are expected to be taken to the market.
A shareholder of telecom service provider Bharti Hexacom Ltd. is this week set to start selling shares in the company that may raise as much as 42.8 billion rupees ($513 million). The pipeline of expected large deals in Mumbai also includes a potential $1 billion offering by Bajaj Housing Finance Ltd.
In Japan, a 70% surge in shares of discount-store chain operator Trial Holdings Inc. since its listing on March 21 could boost sentiment for other newcomers as improving shareholder returns and corporate profits revive optimism in the local market. It’s ¥38.85 billion ($257 million) IPO was the largest in Tokyo since October.
In Hong Kong, meanwhile, the drought in what’s traditionally been one fo the world’s busiest listing venues will probably continue as Chinese firms stay on the sidelines following the scrapping of Syngenta’s and Alibaba’s proposed deals.

Jesse Lingard's manager at FC Seoul has slammed the former Manchester United star's effort since his move to South Korea last month.
Lingard moved to the K League in February after leaving Nottingham Forest at the end of the 2022/23 season. The 31-year-old featured 20 times for Forest last term, helping them avoid relegation from the Premier League.
After no move materialised last summer, Lingard opted to leave Europe to join Seoul ahead of the start of the 2024 season. He has started just once of their opening four games, coming off the bench in the 2-0 win over Jeju United.

And manager Kim Gi-dong has declared he hasn't been pleased with Lingard's work rate since his move to the Seoul World Cup Stadium. ""I've been thinking a lot about removing Jesse,"" he said.
""I don't think a player who doesn't run for a few minutes is a football player.
""If he doesn't fight, and doesn't run better than the player who runs for 90 minutes? If you're going to play soccer in the name, you shouldn't just take the retired players?""
It isn't the first time that Gi-dong has criticised Lingard. After his side picked up their first three points of the season two weeks ago, the Seoul boss was frustrated with Lingard's appearance off the bench.
""Even though he came on as a substitute, he didn't work hard and avoided tussle,"" he said. ""The name value has no meaning on the pitch. I will tell him this exactly.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,232,‘Luxury’ skiing in North Korea: the Russians allowed behind the border,"Gliding down pristine, untouched mountain runs, Olga Shpalok said she was “getting 100% satisfaction”.
After a full day of skiing, the Russian designer from Vladivostok wound down with a visit to her hotel’s well-equipped spa and sauna.
“They said it was very hard to get into the country. But fate smiled upon us,” she said.
Shpalok was part of the first group of foreign tourists to visit North Korea since it shut down its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020.
In early February, she travelled to the country with 100 other Russian tourists on a four-day skiing trip summed up by the Russian embassy as “Pyongyang opens its doors”.
More than 200 Russian tourists have visited North Korea so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Their interviews and accounts give a rare insight into life in Kim Jong-un’s regime.
Closely watched by government “minders”, who restricted what they could see and where they could go, the Russian tourists described spending time in otherwise empty luxurious ski resorts. Some said they felt deep unease over the poverty and total control they witnessed.
Russia’s access to the pariah state is no coincidence. It comes at a time when the two countries have been moving closer at an unprecedented pace, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
North Korea has emerged as Russia’s largest supplier of weapons, shipping artillery shells, missiles and other equipment for Moscow’s continuing war. In exchange, Russia appears to be sending North Korea food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, bypassing international sanctions imposed on the country.
The Russian tourist groups visiting North Korea illustrate another way Moscow can help Pyongyang. Before the pandemic, an estimated 5,000 westerners visited North Korea every year as part of pricey tours but since Covid-19 the borders have been sealed.
Faced with increasingly tightening international sanctions and a reported food crisis triggered by the pandemic isolation, any hard currency is a welcome addition to Pyongyang’s cash-strapped coffers.
“It’s a telling reflection of the regime’s priorities that North Korea has opted to allow Russian tourists access, yet continues to rebuff appeals from humanitarian organisations pleading for entry,” said Hanna Song, of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights in Seoul.
The group tours, first announced in January by several Russian tourist agencies, cost $750 (£600). This includes the round-trip air fare to Pyongyang, North Korea’s sole international airport in the capital. Also covered were the domestic flight to the ski resort on North Korea’s eastern coast, the hotel stay, and meals.
The $40 daily ski pass, souvenirs and other expenses, including alcohol and cigarettes, were paid out of pocket in cash.
The tours begin with a two-hour flight from the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok to Pyongyang, operated by the North Korean state-owned Air Koryo airlines. It is made up of an ageing fleet of mostly Russian-made Tu-154 aircraft.
“When I boarded the plane, I wondered if we were going to make it at all,” recalled Alexandra Daniyelko, a PR manager from Moscow who joined one of the tours.
On arrival at Pyongyang, the Russian tourists visited central Kim Il-sung Square, bowed to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il on Mansu Hill and attended a youth musical performance at the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where members of communist youth groups put on patriotic music and dance performance.

These carefully staged shows are traditionally steeped in government propaganda aimed at instilling North Koreans with national pride and loyalty to Kim’s family, which has ruled ruthlessly since it came to power in 1948.
“I cried at the purity, kindness and talent of these kids,” said Daniyelko, describing the performance.
Another Russian tourist described the children as “perfectly disciplined and obedient”, adding that the local minders confiscated the chocolates that some Russian tourists brought for the children.
But for many on the trip, the holiday truly kicked off on the second day, when the tourists boarded an internal flight to the coastal town of Wonsan near the Masikryong ski resort.
The resort is one of the large-scale construction projects built at the behest of Kim in recent years, thought to have cost £24m. Guests are ferried to the slopes on old Austrian-made gondolas imported from China.
Ahead of the resort’s opening in 2014, a ski-less Kim was photographed in a lift chair smoking a cigarette.
The Russian tourists were told they would be staying at a “five-star Swiss Alps-style resort” which was built on the orders of Kim, himself educated in Switzerland.
Images published on Instagram showed polished hotel rooms, a modern swimming pool, a sauna, a massage area and a hair salon.
“There weren’t any people on the main slopes, which was just perfect,” said Yekaterina Kolomeetsa, a travel blogger from Vladivostok.
Empty ski pistes are hardly surprising considering that there are reportedly just 5,500 skiers among a population of 24 million.
Despite North Korea’s best efforts to present a highly curated image of their country, some Russian tourists said they left disturbed.
“You could sense hopelessness and constant control in the country during the entire trip,” said Shpalok. In Pyongyang, as she rode on a bus with other tourists, she said she rarely saw any cars or people on the roads. “We asked our guides where everyone was. They told us people were happily at work.”
The tourists were strictly forbidden from filming ordinary houses or people and couldn’t venture on walks alone. The few people Shpalok did see looked “short and hungry”, while some children were “barely dressed” despite the cold.
Yulia Mishkova, another Russian tourist, said the trip was worth it for those “looking for a dose of absurdity”.
“I just felt sorry for the frightened North Koreans,” Mishkova said, adding that it was hard to ignore the fact that her daily ski pass cost more than the average monthly salary. “I will not go again for moral and ethical reasons.”
Still, both countries appear to have big plans for the future. According to a report by the government of Primorsky Krai, a region in Russia’s far east on the border of the two countries, North Korea is also building another mass ski resort for Russian tourists that will include 17 hotels, 37 guesthouses and 29 shops.
Tatyana Markova, a representative of the Vostok Intur travel agency, said two hiking trips to North Korea have already been planned for the Russian holidays in May.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,233,"Nearly 30% of South Korean students overweight, with more binge drinking than before","SEOUL - The percentage of South Korean students who are overweight or obese inched down in 2023 compared with the year before, but a growing percentage of students were categorised as heavy drinkers, a government report showed on March 28.
Some 29.6 per cent of elementary, middle and high school students across the country fell into the overweight or obese categories, according to the joint report by the Ministry of Education and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.
This figure marked a slight decrease of 0.9 percentage points from the year before, and a drop of 1.2 percentage points compared with in 2021.
South Korea defines those with a body-mass index (BMI) of between 23 and 24.9 as overweight, and 25 or above as obese.
These definitions are different from the World Health Organisation’s standard, in which a BMI of between 25 and 29.9 is defined as overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher is defined as obese.
Officials conducted the study based on a survey of 87,182 students at 1,009 schools across South Korea.
The survey showed that students living in rural areas – administrative areas categorised as “eup” or “myeon” – had a higher rate of being overweight or obese at 34.4 per cent, compared with 28.7 per cent for those living in urban areas.
The report showed that the average weight of students in their final year of high school has inched up – the weight of boys went up 0.9kg to 72.7kg, while that of girls increased 0.7kg to 58.2kg.
Male students in the final year of middle school weighed more than in the prior year, but girls weighed less, with boys hitting 64.6kg and girls 55.1kg.
However, the weights of both sixth grade boys and girls decreased, with that of boys falling by 1kg to 50.6kg, and that of girls by 0.2kg to 47kg.
The government also surveyed the smoking and drinking rates of students in middle and high schools; the smoking rate refers to the percentage of those who had smoked at least once in the past 30 days, and the drinking rate refers to students who had at least one drink in the same period. The combined smoking rate was 4.2 per cent, down 0.3 per cent from the year before.
By gender, it was 5.6 per cent for males, down 0.6 percentage points compared with in 2022, and 2.7 per cent for females, the same as in 2022.
The drinking rate for both boys and girls dropped from the year before, from 15 per cent to 13 per cent for boys, and from 10.9 per cent to 9 per cent for girls.
But while the report showed that fewer students overall are drinking alcohol, those who do are drinking a lot.
Of those categorised as drinkers, the percentage of those who did “dangerous drinking” – which the study defines as boys having five shots or more of soju and girls having three shots or more of soju at least once in the past 30 days – was 41.3 per cent for boys and 50.1 per cent for girls.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,234,Alan Titchmarsh’s gardening trousers’ totally justified brush with North Korean censors,"Oh, Lord. Western popular culture has sent the North Korean commissars into a frenzy of censorship. Have they turned against the lubricious stylings of Megan Thee Stallion? Has Emma Stone’s “furious jumping” in Poor Things finally landed in Pyongyang? No, this is all to do with Alan Titchmarsh’s trousers (now there’s a name for a band).
One could hardly imagine a less threatening figure than that Yorkshire-born shrub wrangler. True, around the millennial years, he accrued a reputation for including “sexy” scenes in his popular novels, but nobody seriously suggested he was any latter-day Marquis de Sade. With his sensible jumpers and unthreatening gilets, Titchmarsh remains the personification of television’s midafternoon cosy tendency. Many biographers of Alan Partridge see him as a key inspiration for that fictional chatmeister (though Patrick Marber, who created Alan with Steve Coogan, told me sports reporter Elton Welsby was the key progenitor). How unlikely to find him at the centre of an international incident.
[ Patrick Marber: ‘I’ve never had a good idea I didn’t immediately regret’ ]
Loosen your cardigan. Fan your armpits with this dwarf gardenia. Nothing has burst loose from the Titchmarsh gusset. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is reigniting a fashion war that the rest of the world settled 40 or 50 years ago. It seems that a showing of Alan Titchmarsh’s Garden Secrets on Korean television blurred out the presenter’s jeans. Those garments are, the BBC website tells us, seen as “a symbol of western imperialism”. Stills do not suggest anything bulb-clutchingly tight. Titchmarsh appears to have gone for the looser Clarkson-style jean cut.
“It’s taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart,” he commented. “I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist – I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it’s given me a bit of street cred.”

Were we 107 we might suggest last week’s news confirms the completion of a cycle for the blue jean. Once a symbol of rebellion, the garments have gone beyond general acceptability to become a uniform of capitalist conformity. Oh what an irony. Blah, blah, blah.
Alan Titchmarsh on North Korean television, with censored trousers
When did that happen? Well, a long, long time ago. It is nearly 50 years since Gloria Vanderbilt launched her highly priced brand of designer jeans. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan wore them when in office, but only when riding horses under big western skies (Ron) or when folksily chopping logs with the Allman Brothers Band (Jim). By the 1990s, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were actually wearing them indoors. There are still golf clubs and workplaces where jeans are prohibited, but the notion those garments convey anti-establishment leanings went out with the eight-track cartridge and the closed shop.
And yet. It is not insane to detect an irony in this arc. For decades denim jeans were workwear for manual employees. The prehistory goes back to Italy and India (it makes sense that the word “dungaree” derives from that country), but the current ubiquitous trouser emerged in close to its present form as a favourite of miners, farmers and cowboys in the United States during the 19th century. Levi Strauss & Co produced the first version of their own famous jeans in 1873.
It took a long time for them to emerge from the workplace and on to the legs of movie stars. By the early 1940s, something called “western chic” was beginning to attract those celebrities, but you wouldn’t catch Joan Crawford wearing jeans anywhere other than on a ranch (or in Johnny Guitar). It was the generation of Marlon Brando and James Dean that really launched the garment as a youth cult. In Rebel Without a Cause, Dean is distinguished from the older generation by both his surly attitude and his taste for red windbreakers and blue jeans. This was an era when a fellow was expected to cast off such garb when adulthood loomed.
[ Forever in blue jeans - ups and downs of a pair of denims ]
The notion of jeans as a cultural indicator – the preserve of anti-war protesters and sociology lecturers – continued throughout the 1960s, but, a decade or so later, semioticians would struggle to find any meaning in their appearance. By the 1980s, they had become so unremarkable that, in a move of Machiavellian brilliance, Levi had to reinvent the “501″ (something nobody outside the business had then heard of) as a much-beloved classic that, flogged in gorgeous retro ads to the accompaniment of Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye, cost as much as a pair of fine gaberdine slacks. The jeans worn by miners. The jeans worn by biker gangs. The jeans worn by the Trotskyists handing out leaflets at railway stations. Those jeans had been remodelled as luxury items.
On reflection, perhaps the North Koreans are on to something. Titchmarsh and his trousers really are embodiments of imperial decadence.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,235,"Samsung archrival plans construction of world's largest chip factory — at more than $90 billion, it will take more than 20 years to finish, so one wonders what other exciting tech will it produce","SK Hynix, Samsung's chief competitor and the world's number two memory maker, has begun its audacious plan to build the largest chip production facility on the planet.
The construction at SK Hynix's giant Yongin Semiconductor Cluster in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, will comprise four units. Work on the first unit, which is intended to be the world’s biggest three-story fabrication plant, is anticipated to commence in March 2025.
The Korea Economic Daily reports that the project is estimated to cost over 120 trillion won ($90.7 billion) and will span over two decades, with completion expected by 2046.
Government backing
The plan was first announced in 2019 but ran into delays due to Covid and licensing procedures. It received a boost in 2022 following an agreement between the government, municipalities, and companies, according to SK Hynix. The site of the first unit is now 35% prepared.
Trade Minister Ahn Deokgeun visited the site recently, promising government support for Korea's chip industry. “All ministries will work together to ensure that Korean companies won’t lag behind global players in semiconductor manufacturing speed. We will actively support high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to achieve more than $120 billion in semiconductor exports this year,” he said.
The Korea Economic Daily says the government will unveil strategies to accelerate artificial intelligence chip exports and bolster semiconductor equipment by the end of June.

Japan beat North Korea 1-0 in Tokyo earlier in March
Japan have been awarded a 3-0 forfeit win after North Korea called off a 2026 World Cup qualifier due to be held in Pyongyang earlier in March, says Japan's Football Association.
North Korea requested the match to be held at a neutral venue due to worries over infectious diseases in Japan.
The JFA said it has been informed by Fifa's disciplinary committee that the match has been forfeited.
The win means Japan go through to the third round of World Cup qualifiers.
""Although the players lost an important opportunity to play, I see this as a positive step forward,"" Japan manager Hajime Moriyasu said.
""Naturally, we will not be satisfied with this result, but will continue to build up our strength for the national team activities in June, the final qualifying round, and the World Cup.""
Fifa previously said the match - which should have taken place on Tuesday, 26 March - could not be rescheduled.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,239,Russia's veto on UN monitoring of North Korea sanctions sparks international backlash,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that Moscow’s stance aligns with its interests, while the European Union labeled Russia’s veto as an attempt to conceal unlawful arms transfers between North Korea and Russia
Russia faced widespread criticism on Friday following its use of veto power to effectively terminate official United Nations monitoring of sanctions on North Korea amid investigations into alleged arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.
The Russian veto at the UN Security Council on Thursday prevented the renewal of the panel of experts tasked with probing violations of sanctions related to North Korea’s prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

South Korea’s foreign ministry condemned the move as “irresponsible,” with Hwang Joon-kook, South Korea’s UN ambassador, likening it to destroying surveillance cameras to evade detection while committing a crime. Seoul has accused Pyongyang of shipping thousands of weapon containers to Moscow for deployment in Ukraine.
The Kremlin defended its veto, arguing that UN sanctions on North Korea have impeded dialogue and peace efforts on the Korean peninsula and have not contributed to regional security. Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, emphasised that international restrictive measures over the years have failed to improve the security situation in the region.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted that Moscow’s stance aligns with its interests, while the European Union labeled Russia’s veto as an attempt to conceal unlawful arms transfers between North Korea and Russia, particularly in the context of Russia’s alleged illegal war in Ukraine.
The United States, meanwhile, said the vote was a “self-interested effort to bury the panel’s reporting on its own collusion” with North Korea.

“Russia’s actions today have cynically undermined international peace and security, all to advance the corrupt bargain that Moscow has struck with the DPRK,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said after the Thursday vote.
The panel’s mandate expires at the end of April.
North Korea has been under mounting sanctions since 2006, put in place by the UN Security Council in response to its nuclear program.

Since 2019, Russia and China have tried to persuade the Security Council to ease the sanctions, which have no expiration date.
The council has long been divided on the issue.
- ‘Political solution’ -
China abstained rather than joining Russia in the veto. All other members had voted in favor of renewing the expert panel.

Beijing said Friday it opposed “blindly supporting sanctions” on North Korea.
“The current situation in the (Korean) Peninsula remains tense, and blindly imposing sanctions cannot solve the issue,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said.
“A political solution is the only way,” he said when asked why Beijing abstained during the vote, adding that a “showdown at the UN Security Council is not conducive to its authority.”

China and Russia have in recent years ramped up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts, and their strategic partnership has only grown closer since the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzia had earlier said that without an annual review to assess and potentially modify the sanctions, the panel was unjustified.
“The panel has continued to focus on trivial matters that are not commensurate with the problems facing the peninsula,” Nebenzia said.
- Continued tests -
Additional Security Council sanctions were levelled on Pyongyang in 2016 and 2017, but the North’s development of its nuclear and weapons programmes has continued unabated.
Last week, Pyongyang tested a solid-fuel engine for a “new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,” state media reported.
Recent cruise missile launches have prompted speculation that North Korea is testing those weapons before shipping them to Moscow for use in Ukraine.
In its latest report, issued at the beginning of March, the sanctions panel reported that North Korea “continued to flout” sanctions, including by launching ballistic missiles and breaching oil import limits.
It added that it is investigating reports of arms shipments from Pyongyang to Russia for use in Ukraine.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to social media Thursday to call the veto “a guilty plea”.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,240,Why Russia Is Protecting North Korea From Nuclear Monitors,"Through the most tense encounters with President Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia over the past decade, there has been one project in which Washington and Moscow have claimed common cause: keeping North Korea from expanding its arsenal of nuclear weapons.
Now, even that has fallen apart.
On Thursday, Russia used its veto power in the United Nations Security Council to kill off a U.N. panel of experts that has been monitoring North Korea’s efforts to evade sanctions over its nuclear program for the past 15 years.
Russia’s discomfort with the group is a new development. Moscow once welcomed the panel’s detailed reports about sanctions violations and considered Pyongyang’s nuclear program to be a threat to global security.
But more recently, the panel has provided vivid evidence of how Russia is keeping the North brimming with fuel and other goods, presumably in return for the artillery shells and missiles that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is shipping to Russia for use against Ukraine. The group has produced satellite images of ship-to-ship transfers of oil, showing how the war in Ukraine has proved to be a bonanza for the North.",2024-03-29 21:18:14,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times,240,tense president v russia past decade one project common cause keeping north korea expanding arsenal nuclear even fallen russia used veto power united security council kill un panel north evade nuclear program past 15 discomfort group new development detailed considered nuclear program threat global recently panel provided vivid evidence russia keeping north brimming fuel good presumably return artillery north leader kim shipping russia use group produced satellite oil showing war proved bonanza north russia protecting north korea nuclear

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,243,"North Korea Preparing Spy Satellite Launch, South Says","South Korea has warned that North Korea is preparing to launch a new satellite as the race to deploy reconnaissance satellites between the two Koreas heats up.
""While there are activities preparing for an additional military satellite launch by North Korea, there are no signs as of now of an imminent [launch],"" South Korean Colonel Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in a briefing, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap News on Thursday.
Lee further mentioned that South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies are closely monitoring North Korea's military movements without sharing specifics.
The focus on North Korea's potential launch comes as new activity showing preparations at Sohae Satellite Launching Station was captured on satellite imagery. Tensions have escalated on the Korean Peninsula as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has moved away from the previous consensus to seek reconciliation with the southern neighbor.
North Korea's Unha-3 rocket is being prepared for takeoff at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station northwest of Pyongyang on April 8, 2012, in Cholsan County, North Phyongan Province, North Korea. South Korean military officials have...

South Korean military officials have said North Korea may be preparing to launch a new spy satellite. More Lee Hee-Young/Getty Images News/iStock
This renewed focus comes after Pyongyang's deployment of its first military reconnaissance satellite in orbit last November following two unsuccessful attempts earlier in the year.
The launch, which was part of North Korea's plan to deploy three additional spy satellites within the year, has drawn criticism from Washington and Seoul.
The United States and South Korea have denounced the action as a breach of the United Nations Security Council resolutions aimed at limiting North Korea's ballistic missile endeavors.
""Commercial satellite imagery shows an expanse of blue material on North Korea's coastal launch pad at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, the site used to conduct the last three satellite launch attempts,"" 38North, a publication specializing in North Korean affairs, reported Monday.
The 38North report mentioned the sighting of extensive blue material, possibly tarpaulin, arranged in a ""Y"" shape across a 125-meter stretch of tarmac. The setup suggests preparations for launch, mirroring the arrangements observed during previous launch attempts.
Last December, South Korea launched its first spy satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The new satellite successfully transmitted images of central Pyongyang earlier this month.
Meanwhile, experts have confirmed that North Korea's first satellite is operational.
Space analysts have recently observed orbital adjustments to the North's first spy satellite, Malligyong-1, indicating effective control, though the satellite's operational capabilities remain undisclosed. North Korea's state media boasted that the satellite had captured images of strategic military and political locations in the South Korea, the U.S., and beyond, although the claims remain unverified by independent sources, Reuters reported in February.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,244,‘Nothing To Talk About’: North Korea Dismisses Possibility Of Summit With Japan,"Pyongyang said on Friday it had “nothing to talk” about with Japan after claiming that a Japanese diplomat in China had made contact with a North Korean counterpart.
Relations between the two East Asian neighbours have long been strained over the kidnapping of Japanese people in the 1970s and 1980s and North Korea’s banned weapons programmes, although there had been tentative recent signs of a thaw.
A North Korean diplomat in China said on Friday an official from the Japanese embassy in Beijing had proposed “contact through an e-mail” to a councillor at its embassy in the Chinese capital but the proposal was rejected by foreign minister Choe Son Hui.
“… the DPRK will not allow any attempt of Japan to contact the former,” Choe said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name.
“The DPRK-Japan dialogue is not a matter of concern to the DPRK.”
Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, had said on Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had requested a summit with her brother, although a meeting was unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo.
But the next day she said Pyongyang would reject any such contact, citing Japan’s lack of “courage” to rebuild North Korea-Japan relations.
In a separate statement on Friday, North Korea’s ambassador to China Ri Ryong Nam said: “We have nothing to talk about with the Japanese side.”
“I make it clear once again that the DPRK has no reason to meet with the Japanese side at any level,” Ri said.
Kishida said last year he was willing to meet Kim Jong Un “without any conditions” and address all matters, including the abduction of a dozen Japanese citizens by North Korean agents.
Despite Kim Yo Jong’s earlier comments, Kishida said on Thursday he was still willing to work towards a summit to secure the return of the abducted Japanese and address other subjects.
“I’d like to continue to hold high-level dialogues (with North Korea) under my direct supervision,” he told reporters.
However, Choe criticised Kishida on Friday for referring to the abductions, saying she “cannot understand why he persistently adheres to the issue”.",2024-03-29 14:00:57,https://www.news18.com,News18,244,said nothing talk japan diplomat china made contact north two east long strained people 1970s 1980s north although tentative recent north diplomat china said official embassy contact embassy capital proposal foreign minister son … allow attempt japan contact former said acronym north official dialogue matter concern yo powerful sister north leader kim un said prime minister summit brother although meeting unlikely without policy shift next day said would reject contact lack courage rebuild north separate statement north ambassador china nam said nothing talk make clear reason meet side level said last year willing meet kim un without address abduction dozen north kim yo said still willing work towards summit secure return address like continue hold north korea direct supervision told saying understand persistently issue nothing talk north korea possibility summit japan
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,246,"South Korea's birth rate is so low, one company offers staff a $75,000 incentive to have children","Seoul — South Korea's overall birth rate hit a record low of 0.72 in 2023, and with that figure projected to fall even further in 2024, some Korean businesses have started offering remarkably generous incentives to convince their workers to become parents.
""The declining fertility rate leads to a decline in the workforce and purchasing power and slowing economic growth, which in turn directly affects the sustainability of corporate management, meaning companies need to actively address the issue,"" Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI) president Chul Chung said recently at a Korean-Japanese business seminar dedicated to the topic.
Jin Sung Yoo, a senior research fellow at KERI, said the main reason for South Korea's worryingly low birth rate was the ""effect on career progression"" associated with having children.
Many solutions were discussed at the seminar, and some eye-opening incentives have been announced in recent weeks.
The Lotte Group, a massive cross-industry conglomerate, said it had found success through ""various in-house family-friendly policies."" The company said the existing program had helped push the internal birth rate among employees up to 2.05 during 2022, no small feat when the national average was 0.81.
Ok-keun Cho, head of corporate culture at the Lotte Group, said starting this year, the company would also be offering employees with three or more children a 7-9 seat family vehicle, free of charge.
The most generous parenthood incentive, however, is likely the one for workers at the construction and housing group Booyoung, which has been offering employees a $75,000 bonus for each new child they parent.
So far, the company says 66 employees have taken advantage — at a cost to Booyoung of about $5 million.
Company chairman Lee Joong Keun said he sees it as an investment in the nation's future, warning that if the birth rate continues to fall, ""Korea will face a crisis of national existence 20 years from now, including a decline in the economically productive population and a shortage of defense personnel to ensure national security and maintain order.""
Under South Korea's rules, $75,000 is the largest handout a parent can receive without having to pay additional tax on the month. But Booyoung's boss said he wanted to go even further, announcing that he would work to help provide employees who become the parent of a third child with ""housing with no tax burden on tenants and no maintenance responsibilities.""
The construction company chief said he was hoping to get the South Korean government to agree to provide the land necessary for his plans.
Meanwhile, city officials have said that Seoul's local government plans to invest more than $1.3 billion during 2024 in the Birth Encouragement Project, an upgrade to an existing incentive policy.
The project has been largely focused on helping South Korean's maintain their careers around family planning, but it's been expanded to make more people eligible for the benefits, and those benefits now include infertility treatment and more childcare services.",2024-03-29 12:30:10,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News,246,south overall birth rate hit record low 072 2023 figure fall even 2024 offering remarkably generous convince become fertility rate decline power economic growth turn directly corporate management meaning need actively address issue korea economic research institute president said recently business seminar sung senior research fellow said main reason south worryingly low birth rate effect career progression associated seminar recent group massive conglomerate said found success various company said program push internal birth rate among 205 2022 small feat national average 081okkeun cho head corporate culture group said starting year company would also offering three 79 seat family vehicle free generous parenthood incentive however likely one construction housing group offering 75000 bonus new child far company 66 taken advantage cost 5 chairman lee said investment future warning birth rate fall korea face crisis national existence 20 decline economically productive population shortage defense personnel ensure national security maintain south 75000 handout parent receive without pay additional tax month bos said go even would work help provide become parent third child housing tax burden maintenance construction company chief said get south government agree provide land necessary city said local government invest 13 billion 2024 birth encouragement project upgrade incentive project largely helping south maintain around family expanded make people eligible include infertility treatment south birth rate low one company staff 75000 incentive
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,247,Russia shuts down UN Watchdog monitoring North Korea sanctions,"13 out of 14 member states supported the panel’s renewal, with China abstaining.
The veto by Russia prompted condemnation from the US, UK, South Korea, and other Western allies.
South Korea’s representative criticized Russia’s “blind self-centeredness” and dismissed the panel’s accusations.

Russia shut down a panel of UN experts that had been monitoring sanctions against North Korea for years. Last week, the panel announced it was investigating reports indicating Russia’s violation of rules by purchasing North Korean weapons, such as ballistic missiles, for use in Ukraine. Since 2006, the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions on Pyongyang for its nuclear weapons program.
The Security Council vote on Thursday resulted in the disbandment of the expert group established to monitor violations of the restrictions, despite the ongoing enforcement of those measures. Russia, exercising its veto power as a permanent member, blocked the renewal, while 13 of the other 14 member states present supported it.
China, North Korea’s closest ally, chose to abstain. The veto by Russia prompted strong condemnation from the US, UK, South Korea, and other Western allies. This action follows a year marked by high-profile public meetings between leaders of Moscow and Pyongyang.
For the first time in 14 years, Russia blocked the renewal of the panel, which has been annually approved by the UN Security Council. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba asserted on social media that Russia’s veto essentially admitted guilt, implying its use of North Korean weapons in the conflict.
The US, UK, and France all accused Russia in the Council, stating that it silenced the watchdog because it had started to report on Moscow’s breaches of the rules, particularly the procurement of weapons from North Korea for deployment in Ukraine’s battlegrounds.
Meanwhile, at the UN, South Korea’s representative criticized Russia’s “blind self-centeredness,” asserting that Russia had no justification for disbanding the guardians of the sanctions regime. Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook likened the action to destroying a CCTV camera to avoid being caught red-handed. Russia’s representative at the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, has consistently denied the use of North Korean weapons and again dismissed the accusations on Thursday. He also argued that the panel of experts provided no added value.

“The panel has continued to focus on trivial matters that are not commensurate with the problems facing the peninsula,” said Mr Nebenzia, who also added that sanctions had imposed a “heavy burden” on the North Korean people.

FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,248,South Korea launches high-speed train - to help improve country's birth rate by cutting commuting times,"South Korea has come up with a novel idea to get one of its biggest problems back on track – by launching a high speed train service.
The country has the world's lowest birth rate as the average number of expected babies for a South Korean woman during her child-bearing life fell to a record low of 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, according to data from Statistics Korea.
Young people have complained about the cramped living conditions and expensive housing in greater Seoul, plus long commutes, as motives for not getting married and starting a family.
Seoul's birth rate is even lower than the national average and government efforts have failed to reverse the decline with subsidies - 360 trillion won (£213bn) since 2006.
Officials are relying on the Great Train eXpress (GTX) to spur the rates expected to provide six lines linking Seoul to several outlying areas by 2035.

The government is spending 134 trillion won (£78.8bn) on the project.
On Friday, President Yoon Suk Yeol inaugurated a section of the first line, which will cut the commute time from Suseo in the capital to the township of Dongtan, south of Seoul, to 19 minutes instead of 80 minutes by bus.

The branch is to open from Saturday and when the GTX is fully operational is will be one of the fastest underground systems in the world, with trains travelling at speeds of up to 112 mph, officials said.

'How can anyone make time for babies?'
Land Minister Park Sang-woo said the GTX would allow young people to consider homes far away from the capital without having to spend hours commuting.
""With a two-hour commute on the way home, for example, how can anyone make time for babies? The idea is to give people more leisure time after work,"" he said.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,250,iPad Pro Delays Could Be Down to Poor OLED Panel Production Yields,"OLED panel supply issues may be partly behind Apple's iPad Pro launch delay, based on reports coming out of Korea.
Apple's original plan was to rely on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming iPad Pro models, with Samsung Display exclusively producing ~11-inch panels and LG Display responsible for the required ~13-inch panels.
The division of labor was reportedly due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for OLED iPad Pro models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies.
Early reports suggested the new models could arrive as soon as this month. However, according to Korean news site hankooki.com, Samsung has recently faced poor yields of the ~11-inch OLED panels, and it has been unable to meet Apple's order quantity. The shortfall has led Apple to transfer some orders for the smaller panel to LG Display. The latter is subsequently expected to increase its order by hundreds of thousands of units going into next month.
Given the reallocation, LG Display is now likely to supply 60% of the panels for the upcoming iPad Pro models. The company has invested millions of dollars into its sixth-generation small- and medium-sized OLED production line, and has now passed Apple's quality control standards for the smaller panels, enabling it to take up the slack from Samsung.
Apple earlier this month ordered an initial 8.5 million OLED display panels from the South Korean suppliers. Apple's latest shipments forecast is said to have been a decrease from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year.
Apple is rumored to be aiming for ""unrivaled"" display quality with the new iPad Pro models, which will use a tandem OLED structure. The tandem structure is a method of stacking two layers of OLED light-emitting layers. It is superior to the luminance (screen brightness) and lifespan of a single OLED structure with one light-emitting layer. The iPhone currently uses a single stack OLED display with one light-emitting layer.
Apple will now introduce new iPad Pro models alongside new iPad Air models in early May, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple is apparently working to ""finish software for the new devices,"" and the iPad Pro models also need ""complex new manufacturing techniques,"" which Gurman says has contributed to the delay.",2024-03-29 10:42:17,https://www.macrumors.com,MacRumors,250,panel supply may partly behind pro launch delay based coming original plan rely different display upcoming pro display exclusively 11inch display responsible 13inch division labor reportedly due demand outlook pro well unstable production capacity yield two still getting requirement new panel new could arrive soon month however according news site recently faced poor 11inch unable meet order quantity shortfall led apple transfer smaller panel display latter subsequently increase order going next reallocation display likely supply 60 upcoming pro company million small production line quality control smaller take slack month ordered initial 85 million display south latest forecast said decrease 10 million 2024 last aiming unrivaled display quality new pro use tandem structure tandem structure method two superior luminance screen brightness single structure one layer currently single stack display one introduce new pro alongside new air early may according mark apple apparently working finish new pro also need complex new delay pro could poor panel production
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,251,iPhone 16 Pro Models Could Feature New Polished Titanium Finish,"Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will use an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium, claims a new rumor out of Korea.
According to news aggregator account ""yeux1122"" on the Naver blog, the new process will make the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max look more polished than the iPhone 15 Pro models, which have a brushed finish.
The improved manufacturing process will allegedly result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in previous Pro iPhones. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.
The ‌‌brushed finish on ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models‌‌ is considerably less reflective than the finish of previous Pro iPhones. It is less prone to fingerprints and also reduces scratch visibility. Apart from looks though, Apple's use of a titanium frame for its ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ devices also cut down the weight of the devices. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro Max.
In addition, the titanium frame and aluminum substructure also provides better heat dissipation than any previous-generation Pro models with stainless steel frames, according to Apple.
A rumor earlier this week claimed that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will come in new ""space black"" and ""rose"" titanium colors. The ""rose"" is a gold shade, while ""space black"" could replace the black titanium option.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,252,Russia protects North Korea in the UN with veto of resolution to investigate sanction violations,"By Richard Roth, Catherine Nicholls, Louis Mian and Brad Lendon, CNN
United Nations (CNN) — Russia on Thursday vetoed a United Nations resolution that would renew an independent panel of experts investigating North Korea’s violations of Security Council sanctions, at a time when Pyongyang has become a key supplier of munitions for Moscow’s war against Ukraine.
In recent years, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen a massive buildup in Pyongyang’s ballistic missile program, with dozens of tests in a year, including long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the United States mainland.
International sanctions and UN investigations into North Korea’s illegal weapons program have previously been backed by Russia. But relations between Moscow and the West are at a historic low over the war unleashed on Ukraine. Facing increased international ostracism – and acute ammunition shortages – Russian President Vladimir Putin has grown more reliant on North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un.
North Korea has also gained a powerful backer at the UN which wields veto power.
Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council the UN-imposed sanctions regime on Pyongyang, aimed at stopping North Korea from conducting nuclear tests or launching ballistic missiles, is “losing its relevance” and is “detached from reality,” according to a UN press release.
Since UN Resolution 1718 was passed in 2006 establishing the seven-member panel, sanctions on North Korea have not achieved their aims or contributed to an improved situation on the Korean Peninsula, Russia contended.
Nebenzia said Thursday a coalition of countries led by the US wanted to strangle Pyongyang, a situation that affects Russia’s national security.
While UN sanctions prohibit arms transfers to or from North Korea, the Kim regime has become a big supplier of weapons to Putin’s war effort in Ukraine.
South Korea’s defense minister said in February that North Korea munitions factories are operating at full capacity to produce armaments to send to Russia, including millions of rounds of artillery shells.
Ukraine has also said it has found debris from North Korean-made ballistic missiles after attacks on targets in the country.
The vote in the 15-member Security Council on Thursday was 13 in favor, Russia opposed and China abstaining. But as Russia holds veto power, the resolution to continue the panel of experts’ work failed.
Britain’s Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward called the Russian veto “deeply concerning.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” Woodward told the Security Council. Adding that “it is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.”
“This veto undermines the panel’s work; the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime; and this Council’s credibility in upholding UN Security Council resolutions,” Woodward said, adding that the panel of experts has “played a vital role in constraining” North Korea over the past decade.
US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood asked how a civilized nation could block the approval.
“You silenced the panel of experts today, but you will never silence those in favor of a nonproliferation regime,” Wood said to Russia.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry also called Russia’s decision “irresponsible.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,253,Alerts issued as yellow dust engulfs South Korea,"SEOUL - Yellow and fine dust blanketed South Korea on March 29 with a thick haze of pollution categorized as “very bad” in the central region of the country, prompting the state weather agency to issue advisories.
Yellow dust advisories for the greater Seoul area, Gangwon and South Chungcheong provinces were raised to “caution,” the second-lowest level in the government’s four-stage crisis alert as of 8am on March 29, according to the Ministry of Environment.
A yellow dust warning is issued when the average hourly concentration of fine particulate matter or PM10 stays above 300 micrograms for longer than two hours.
The Environment Ministry said it has issued North Gyeongsang Province the “attention” level against yellow dust, the lowest in its warning system.
The “attention” level is issued when particulate matter concentrations are forecast to be “very bad.” The weather authorities here categorize concentrations of PM 10 between zero and 30 micrograms as “good,” between 31 and 80 as “normal,” between 81 and 150 as “bad” and more than 151 as “very bad.”
As yellow dust originating near the Inner Mongolia region is being carried into the country by northwesterly winds, the fine dust level across the country is expected to remain at “bad” to “very bad” throughout the day.
The yellow dust is expected to continue to cover the country as it moves southeastward with the northwesterly winds and is expected to continue to affect the country through March 30, according to the weather authorities.
Korea’s national weather agency advised people with respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses, the elderly and children to stay indoors. People should use masks when going outside when fine dust levels are high. The agency also advised avoiding rain, as it contains fine dust particles.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,254,ANALYSIS-Russian veto points to 'grim future' for North Korea sanctions enforcement,"Russia's move to effectively disband the panel of experts monitoring longstanding United Nations sanctions against North Korea points to a ""grim future"" for the sanctions enforcement, three former members of the panel told Reuters.
Russia vetoed the annual renewal of the multinational panel of experts on Thursday, which has spent the last 15 years monitoring U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. China, North Korea's only military ally and its largest trading partner, abstained. Beijing and Moscow have denied breaking sanctions but have blocked new measures at the UN Security Council and advocated lifting some existing sanctions on North Korea, blaming the West and its allies for exacerbating tensions.
Diplomats said it appeared unlikely there would be another vote to try to renew the mandate before it expires on April 30. The veto highlights a rare diplomatic dividend for Pyongyang and underlines its deepening ties with Moscow, which have included unprecedented shipments of ballistic missiles and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine as well as possible fuel supplies for North Korea, according to U.S. and South Korean officials and independent analysts.
Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen military relations and Russia's spy chief visited North Korea this week to vow a united front against ""attempts to increase pressure from external forces."" The vote was significant and represents a major turning point in the international sanctions regime against North Korea, said Aaron Arnold, a former member of the panel who now works as a sanctions expert at Britain's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
""Russia's vote, along with its blatant violation of sanctions by buying conventional arms from North Korea, years long history of ignoring their obligations, and at least tacit support from China suggest that the future is grim for the DPRK sanctions regime,"" he said, using the initials of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. PUZZLE PIECES
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia criticized the experts' work, saying before the vote that its reports had been reduced to ""playing into the hands of Western approaches, reprinting biased information and analysing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos."" Even the panel's backers acknowledge that its work was increasingly constrained, but blamed it on Chinese and Russian members blocking or obfuscating unfavourable findings.
""The latest report is very interesting, because although it goes into some useful detail on finance and on overseas workers, China is barely mentioned,"" said one former senior member who asked not to be named because of diplomatic sensitivities. ""If you're talking about breaching the sanctions, and not mentioning China, that's not really a terribly accurate reflection of what is really going on."" While the panel reports looked like a comprehensive summary, they were more like a small part of a larger puzzle, often with some of the most important pieces left out, the former member said.
The end of the panel could lead to more trilateral cooperation among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, and more evidence of sanctions violations could be released to the public since the restraining influence Russia and China had over headline-generating reports will be gone with the UN panel of experts, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. Because global banks and insurance companies have come to rely on independent reports to freeze and close accounts associated with North Korean overseas sanctions evasion networks, continued reporting mechanisms will be found, said Hugh Griffiths, former head of the panel and now a sanctions consultant.
DEEPER RUSSIA-NORTH KOREA TIES Griffiths said the veto suggests Russia does not want its illegal procurement of North Korean ballistic missiles and conventional artillery munitions to be reported by a UN Security Council body.
""Russia's veto indicates that Putin will intensify his ballistic missile and embargo-busting cooperation with North Korea,"" he said. The vote illustrates how strong the ties between Russia-North Korea have become, said Jenny Town of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring programme.
""It underscores that no new sanctions at the UN Security Council level should be expected in the current geopolitical environment, and the bigger burden on states now to handle sanctions monitoring efforts,"" she said. The United States and South Korea launched a new task force this week aimed at preventing North Korea from procuring illicit oil, particularly from Russia.
The two countries also imposed unilateral sanctions on individuals and entities based in Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of channelling funds to Pyongyang's weapons programs. South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North, called the vote ""extremely regrettable.""
Most visible sanctions enforcement has already been headed by the United States and its partners, sometimes in conflict with China or Russia.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,255,"Russia veto ends UN monitoring of sanctions on North Korea; US calls it 'reckless', South Korea terms it 'irresponsible'","The Russian veto of the United Nations panel’s renewal comes weeks after the body said it was probing allegations of weapons transfer from North Korea to Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine War
The United States, South Korea joined other nations to slam Russia who vetoed the renewal of a panel of United Nations (UN) experts to monitor sanctions on North Korea. They went on to accuse Moscow of colluding with Pyongyang.
The Russian veto of the UN panel’s renewal comes weeks after the body said it was probing reports of weapons transfer from North Korea to Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine War.

Following Russia’s veto, the US termed the move as “reckless” and one that “undermined international peace and security”. South Korea termed the Russian decision as “irresponsible decision”.
On its part, Russia’s UN envoy Vasily Nebenzia said that the sanctions on North Korea were unjustified without annual review and potential modifications. He further told the UNSC members that the West was trying to “strangle” North Korea and sanctions have proven to be “irrelevant” and “detached from reality”.
Referring to the reported weapons deals between North Korea and Russia, UK’s UN envoy Barbara Woodward said Russia’s vote was not out of concern for North Koreans but it was “about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine”.
What was UN vote about?

The UNSC, on Thursday, voted on the proposed renewal of a UN panel to monitor sanctions on North Korea. The panel is formally called the ‘Panel of Experts assisting the Sanctions Committee’ which was established in 2006.
If the resolution would have passed in the voting, the panel would have been renewed till April 30, 2025.

The UN, in a release said, the passage would have also included a UNSC request to the panel to submit its confidential midterm report by August 23 and its final report by February 14, 2025.
Of the 15 members of the UNSC, Russia vetoed the proposed renewal of the panel while China abstained from voting. The 13 other members, including the permanent UNSC members the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, all voted for the renewal.
US terms vote ‘collusion’, Ukraine says Russia entered ‘guilty plea’.

The US condemned the Russian veto and linked it to the alleged Russian procurement of North Korean weapons. US Deputy UN envoy Robert Wood said Russia was attempting to silence the UN panel’s “independent objective investigations” because it “began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the UN Security Council resolutions”.

He further said the move will embolden North Korea to keep adversely affecting the world security with its development of “long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts”.
For months, the US has been alleging that Russia is procuring arms and ammunition from North Korea in violations of international sanctions to use in its war on Ukraine. In return for weapons sales to Russia amid the war, North Korea is understood to be seeking fighter jets and ballistic-missile launch technology, said White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby in January.
Separately, in a statement following Russia’s vote, Kirby termed it “reckless action” that undermined sanctions against North Korea. He also warned against the deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia. He further said, “The international community should resolutely uphold the global nonproliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression.”
Referring to the alleged Russia-North Korea weapons deals, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on social media that the Russian veto amounted to “a guilty plea”.
UK’s UN envoy Barbara Woodward said, “This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions. It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine…This panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia.”
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), France’s UN envoy Nicolas de Riviere expressed “deep regrets” over the Russian veto. He said, “France deeply regrets the Russian veto which put a stop to the renewal of the mandate of the 1718 Sanctions Committee’s panel of experts. This veto purposely ends their work of reporting on North Korea’s arms deliveries to Russia, in violation of the Security Council resolutions.”

South Korea slammed Russia’s veto as “irresponsible” and pointed out that Russia “despite its status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has made an irresponsible decision”. Separately, Korean UN envoy Hwang Joonkook also said that the North Korea’s continued provocations and sanctions evasion, the role of the panel was all the more essential.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,256,Russian veto brings an end to the U.N. panel that monitors North Korea nuclear sanctions,"UNITED NATIONS — A veto Thursday by Russia ended monitoring of U.N. sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, prompting Western accusations that Moscow is seeking to avoid scrutiny as it allegedly violates the sanctions to buy weapons from Pyongyang for its war in Ukraine.
Russia’s turnaround on the U.N. monitoring reflects how Moscow’s growing animosity with the United States and its Western allies since the start of the Ukraine war has made it difficult to reach consensus on even issues where there has been longstanding agreement.
The veto came during a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have extended the mandate of a panel of experts monitoring sanctions on North Korea for a year, but which will now halt its operation when its current mandate expires at the end of April.
The vote in the 15-member council, with 13 in favor, Russia against, and China abstaining, has no impact on the actual sanctions against North Korea, which remain in force.
Russia had never before tried to block the work of the panel of experts, which had been renewed annually by the U.N. Security Council for 14 years and reflected global opposition to North Korea’s expanding nuclear weapons program.
Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote that Western nations are trying to “strangle” North Korea and that sanctions are losing their “relevance” and are “detached from reality” in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the country.
He accused the panel of experts of “increasingly being reduced to playing into the hands of Western approaches, reprinting biased information and analyzing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos.” Therefore, he said, it is “essentially conceding its inability to come up with sober assessments of the status of the sanctions regime.”
But U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood called the panel’s work essential and accused Russia of attempting to silence its “independent objective investigations” because it “began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.”
He warned that Russia’s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardizing global security through development “of long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts.”
White House national security spokesman John Kirby condemned Russia’s veto as a “reckless action” that undermines sanctions imposed on North Korea, while warning against the deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia, particularly as North Korea continues to supply Russia with weapons as it wages its war in Ukraine.
“The international community should resolutely uphold the global nonproliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression,” Kirby told reporters.
Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” she said. “It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.”
“This panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,” Woodward said.
France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere added that “North Korea has been providing Russia with military material in support of its aggression against Ukraine, in violation of many resolutions which Russia voted in favor of.”
Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky responded, calling these “unfounded insinuations” that “only strengthened our conviction that we took the right decision to not support the extension of the panel of experts.”
The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches.

TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,257,South Korea’s ambassador to Australia steps down amid investigation controversy,"SEOUL - South Korea’s ambassador to Australia resigned on March 29 as questions about his appointment while he is under a corruption probe battered President Yoon Suk-yeol’s ruling party less than two weeks from a closely fought parliamentary election.
Mr Lee Jong-sup, who was appointed ambassador to Australia just four weeks ago, is being investigated over allegations that he tried to improperly influence a probe into the death of a marine in 2023 while he was defence minister.
“His resignation was reported to the President, and it has been decided it will be accepted,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Reuters could not immediately contact Mr Lee for comment.
Mr Lee has previously denied any wrongdoing and said he was willing to cooperate fully with the investigation.
Criticism of Mr Lee’s appointment grew sharply when he flew to Canberra on March 10, which opposition party members decried as an attempt to evade questioning in the case.
Some members of Mr Yoon’s People Power Party (PPP) have also said he was the wrong choice for an ambassador, and it was a mistake for him to leave.
Mr Lee returned to Seoul last week for what he said were official meetings and said he hoped to have the chance to answer questions by the national corruption agency handling the case.
But the outcry over his appointment and his hasty departure did not end, and some PPP members said he was a political burden for the party as it tries to win back control of Parliament in the April 10 elections.

It comes amid a corruption investigation, which is examining allegations that he tampered with a South Korean Marine Corps' inquiry into a soldier's death What's next? On Friday, the South Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed his resignation.
South Korea's new ambassador to Australia has resigned after less than a month in the job, as he faces a corruption probe at home.
On March 4, Lee Jong-sup was named by President Yoon Suk Yeol's conservative administration to replace Kim Wan-joong in Canberra.
The former defence minister then flew to Australia on March 12 to take up the position as top envoy after South Korea's justice ministry lifted a travel ban on him to allow him to leave.
But he was forced home 10 days later amid an investigation by the country's Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials over allegations he interfered with a probe into the drowning of a South Korean soldier.
Mr Lee has denied any wrongdoing.
Opposition MPs accused the government of sending Mr Lee to Australia to shield him from facing justice.
The appointment proved highly controversial and politically poisonous ahead of parliamentary elections in April, and members of South Korea's diaspora in Australia protested the decision outside of Parliament House.

On Friday, the South Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed his resignation.

John Lee, the editor of the online publication, Korea Pro, said the saga was an ""embarrassment"" to the government and the president.

It was revealed he had not been equipped with a life jacket.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,262,Russia protects North Korea in the UN with veto of resolution to investigate sanction violations,"United Nations CNN —
Russia on Thursday vetoed a United Nations resolution that would renew an independent panel of experts investigating North Korea’s violations of Security Council sanctions, at a time when Pyongyang has become a key supplier of munitions for Moscow’s war against Ukraine.
In recent years, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen a massive buildup in Pyongyang’s ballistic missile program, with dozens of tests in a year, including long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the United States mainland.
International sanctions and UN investigations into North Korea’s illegal weapons program have previously been backed by Russia. But relations between Moscow and the West are at a historic low over the war unleashed on Ukraine. Facing increased international ostracism – and acute ammunition shortages – Russian President Vladimir Putin has grown more reliant on North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un.
North Korea has also gained a powerful backer at the UN which wields veto power.
Russian Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council the UN-imposed sanctions regime on Pyongyang, aimed at stopping North Korea from conducting nuclear tests or launching ballistic missiles, is “losing its relevance” and is “detached from reality,” according to a UN press release.
Video Ad Feedback A timeline of North Korea's recent missile tests 02:22 - Source: CNN
Since UN Resolution 1718 was passed in 2006 establishing the seven-member panel, sanctions on North Korea have not achieved their aims or contributed to an improved situation on the Korean Peninsula, Russia contended.
Nebenzia said Thursday a coalition of countries led by the US wanted to strangle Pyongyang, a situation that affects Russia’s national security.
While UN sanctions prohibit arms transfers to or from North Korea, the Kim regime has become a big supplier of weapons to Putin’s war effort in Ukraine.
South Korea’s defense minister said in February that North Korea munitions factories are operating at full capacity to produce armaments to send to Russia, including millions of rounds of artillery shells.
Ukraine has also said it has found debris from North Korean-made ballistic missiles after attacks on targets in the country.
The vote in the 15-member Security Council on Thursday was 13 in favor, Russia opposed and China abstaining. But as Russia holds veto power, the resolution to continue the panel of experts’ work failed.
Britain’s Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward called the Russian veto “deeply concerning.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” Woodward told the Security Council. Adding that “it is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.”
“This veto undermines the panel’s work; the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime; and this Council’s credibility in upholding UN Security Council resolutions,” Woodward said, adding that the panel of experts has “played a vital role in constraining” North Korea over the past decade.
US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood asked how a civilized nation could block the approval.
“You silenced the panel of experts today, but you will never silence those in favor of a nonproliferation regime,” Wood said to Russia.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,264,Russia criticised for blocking renewal of UN monitors of North Korea,"Russia has blocked the renewal of a UN panel monitoring sanctions against North Korea, weeks after the body said it was investigating reports of arms transfers between Moscow and Pyongyang.
The move was met with a flurry of criticism, including by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who took to social media to call the veto “a guilty plea” amid allegations that Pyongyang is aiding Moscow in its war against Kyiv.
The United States called the veto by Russia a “self-interested effort to bury the panel’s reporting on its own collusion” with North Korea.
Moscow’s veto at the security council does not remove the sanctions on North Korea, but spells the end for the group monitoring their implementation – and myriad alleged violations. The panel’s mandate expires at the end of April.
Russia had never previously tried to block the work of the panel of experts, which had been renewed annually by the UN security council for 14 years and reflected global opposition to North Korea’s expanding nuclear weapon programme.
Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote that western nations were trying to “strangle” North Korea and that sanctions are losing their “relevance” and “detached from reality” in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the country.
But US deputy ambassador Robert Wood called the panel’s work essential and accused Russia of attempting to silence its “independent objective investigations” because it “began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the UN security council resolutions.”
He said Russia’s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardising global security through development “of long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts”.
Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of UN sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year.”
“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” she said. “It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.
“This panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia.”
France’s UN ambassador Nicolas de Riviere added that “North Korea has been providing Russia with military material in support of its aggression against Ukraine, in violation of many resolutions which Russia voted in favour of.”
The security council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking – so far unsuccessfully – to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a US-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches.
The security council established a committee to monitor sanctions and the mandate for its panel of experts to investigate violations had been renewed for 14 years until Thursday.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,265,"World News in Brief: Russia vetoes DPR Korea sanctions resolution, children under fire in Sudan, drought plagues Malawi","A United States resolution to extend the mandate of an expert panel which monitors sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was vetoed by Russia in the Security Council on Thursday. This in effect abolishes the monitoring of UN sanctions against the country, more commonly known as North Korea, blocking the extension of the panel for another year. Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the sanctions regime adopted with the intention of preventing nuclear weapons proliferation, was losing its relevance and also ""to a great extent, detached from reality."" He said that an ""unprecedented"" Western-led policy was in place to ""strangle Pyongyang"", including harsh unilateral sanctions, ""aggressive propaganda"" and ""direct personal threats"". He said the ""active militarization"" of the Korean Peninsula due to action by the NATO alliance was making matters worse, and directly threatening Russia's interests in the region. ### China abstains The vote in the 15-member Council was 13 in favour, Russia against and China abstaining. ![Deputy Permanent Representative Robert A.

Wood of the United States addresses the UN Security Council meeting on the mandate of the 1718 Committee Panel of Experts monitoring the sanctions imposed on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The resolution does not alter the sanctions in place and they remain in force. The US Deputy Permanent Representative Robert Wood said that Russia's veto was nothing more than an attempt ""to silence the independent objective investigations into DPRK Security Council violations."" He said the veto had been used solely because the panel had in recent months begun reporting on ""blatant violations"" and persistent sanctions-busting ""within Russia's jurisdiction."" He said today's vote would only embolden North Korea to act with impunity. The Republic of Korea's Ambassador Hwang Joonkook told the Council before the vote that the panel of experts had been faithfully carrying out its duty for 15 years, and their work played a ""crucial role"" towards better sanctions implementation. He said faced with DPRK's continued provocations and sanctions evasion, the role of the panel was all the more essential.

The alert from the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, follows a recent mission to the city of Omdurman near Khartoum, where one hospital performed 300 amputations in a month, and where two to three patients share a bed. Jill Lawler, UNICEF Chief of Field Operations in Sudan, said that millions have been affected and displaced across the country. Listen to the full interview below where she describes the predicament of young mothers who are too weak to breastfeed their babies: Soundcloud UNICEF says that 24 million children in Sudan have been exposed to conflict and a staggering 730,000 are severely acutely malnourished. Some women and girls who were raped in the first months of the war are now delivering babies, the UN agency has learned, while many young people can also be seen carrying arms. Although humanitarian supplies are available in Port Sudan, the key challenge is securing safe aid access to affected populations, UNICEF said. ## **UN and partners support Malawi's battle against severe drought** The UN and aid partners are assisting Malawi's efforts to respond to a severe drought in the African nation which has prompted the Government to declare a state of emergency.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,267,Wean itself off Nvidia': Samsung signs $750 million agreement with South Korea's largest online platform — Naver wants to replace Nvidia's super expensive AI GPU with the more affordable Mach-1 chip,"In a move to cut its dependency on Nvidia's high-cost AI chips, Naver, the South Korean equivalent of Google, has signed a 1 trillion won ($750 million) agreement with Samsung.
The deal will see the tech giant supply its more affordable Mach-1 chips to Naver, by the end of 2024.
The Mach-1 chip, currently under development, is an AI accelerator in the form of a SoC that combines Samsung’s proprietary processors and low-power DRAM chips to reduce the bottleneck between the GPU and HBM.
Just the start
The announcement of the Mach-1 was made during Samsung’s 55th regular shareholders' meeting. Kye Hyun Kyung, CEO of Samsung Semiconductor, said the chip design had passed technological validation on FPGAs and that finalization of SoC was in progress.
The exact volume of Mach-1 chips to be supplied and prices are still under discussion, but The Korea Economic Daily reports that Samsung intends to price the Mach-1 AI chip at around $3,756 each. The order is expected to be for somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 units.
Naver plans to use Samsung’s Mach-1 chips to power servers for its AI map service, Naver Place. According to The Korea Economic Daily, Naver will order further Mach-1 chips if the initial batch performs as well as hoped.
Samsung sees this deal with Naver as just the start. The tech giant is reportedly in supply talks with Microsoft and Meta Platforms who, like Naver, are actively seeking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia’s AI hardware.

With the Naver deal, Samsung is also looking to better compete with its South Korean rival SK Hynix, which is the dominant player in the advanced HBM segment. Samsung has been heavily investing in HBM recently and at the start of March announced the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E 12H DRAM. This reportedly outperforms Micron's 24GB 8H HBM3E in terms of capacity and bandwidth and is expected to begin shipping in Q2 this year.",2024-03-28 19:04:11,https://www.techradar.com,TechRadar,267,move cut dependency ai chip south equivalent 1 trillion 750 million agreement deal see tech giant supply affordable mach1 chip end 2024the mach1 chip currently development ai accelerator form soc proprietary dram chip reduce bottleneck announcement mach1 made 55th regular meeting semiconductor said chip design technological validation soc exact volume mach1 chip still discussion korea economic daily price mach1 ai chip around 3756 order somewhere 150000 200000 use mach1 chip power ai map service place according korea economic daily order mach1 chip initial batch well deal start tech giant reportedly supply meta like actively seeking reduce reliance ai pro subscribe newsletter sign pro newsletter get top news opinion guidance business need succeed contact news future receive u behalf deal also looking better compete south rival dominant player advanced segment heavily recently start march first 12stack hbm3e 12h dram reportedly 24gb 8h hbm3e capacity begin shipping q2 year wean 750 million agreement south platform replace super expensive ai affordable mach1 chip
TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,268,Russia only nation to veto UN monitoring of sanctions of North Korea,"Russia was the only nation to veto the annual renewal of a panel of experts who monitor the enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile activities.
The block comes as the US has accused Pyongyang of transferring weapons to the Kremlin, which Russia has used in the Ukraine war.
Both countries have denied the allegations but said there was a desire to strengthen military relations last year.
Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un met at Russia's Vostochny Cosmodrome in September, when the North Korean leader had pledged his support to Moscow to ""fight against imperialism"".
Mr Kim also said he was ""convinced"" that the ""heroic Russian army"" would triumph in its war with Ukraine - a conflict he referred to by the Kremlin's preferred term of ""special military operation"".

China abstained from the vote on Thursday, while the remaining 13 council members - including permanent seats of the UK, US and France - all voted in favour of renewing the group of experts which has monitored UN sanctions for the past 15 years.
The mandate for the current panel is to expire on 30 April 2024.
The veto comes almost a week after Moscow's Crocus City Hall was attacked, leaving more than 140 people dead.
In response to Russia's decision, Robert Wood, the deputy US ambassador to the UN, said: ""Moscow has undermined the prospect of the peaceful, diplomatic resolution of one of the world's most dangerous nuclear proliferation issues.""

South Korea's UN ambassador Joonkook Hwang said: ""This is almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid
being caught red-handed.""
Meanwhile, Russia's UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the council before the vote that Western nations were trying to ""strangle"" North Korea and sanctions have proven ""irrelevant"" and ""detached from reality"" in limiting its nuclear mission.
Mr Nebenzia criticised the experts' previous monitoring saying they were ""playing into the hands"" of the West by adopting biased strategies.

However, the totalitarian state has not denuclearised and even vowed to increase the country's stock of nuclear weapons this year.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,271,Russian veto brings end to UN panel monitoring enforcement of North Korea nuclear sanctions,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia vetoed a U.N. resolution Thursday in a move that effectively abolishes the monitoring by United Nations experts of sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, though the sanctions themselves remain in place.
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia vetoed a U.N. resolution Thursday in a move that effectively abolishes the monitoring by United Nations experts of sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, though the sanctions themselves remain in place.
Russia’s turnaround on the monitoring -- which it repeatedly agreed to in the past -- prompted Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its weapons purchases from North Korea for use in its war against Ukraine, in violation of the U.N. sanctions.
The vote in the 15-member council was 13 in favor, Russia against, and China abstaining. The Security Council resolution would have extended the mandate of the panel of experts for a year, but Russia’s veto will halt its operation. The U.N. sanctions against North Korea still remain in force.
Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote that Western nations are trying to “strangle” North Korea and that sanctions have proven “irrelevant” and “detached from reality” in reining in the country's nuclear program.
U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood told the council after the vote that Russia’s veto was nothing more than “the attempt by one council member to silence the independent objective investigations” into North Korea’s sanctions violations.
He said Russia acted because “the panel began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.”
White House national security spokesman John Kirby condemned Russia’s veto as a “reckless action” that undermines sanctions imposed on North Korea, while warning against the deepening cooperation between North Korea and Russia, particularly as North Korea continues to supply Russia with weapons as it wages its war in Ukraine.
“The international community should resolutely uphold the global nonproliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression,” Kirby told reporters.
Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year.”
The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches.
The Security Council established a committee to monitor sanctions and the mandate for its panel of experts to investigate violations had been renewed for 14 years.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,283,Why thousands of doctors are protesting in South Korea,"For around six weeks now, thousands of junior doctors have walked off their jobs in South Korea and refused to see patients. They have been protesting against a government plan that intends to sharply increase medical school admissions and the number of physicians in the country.
More and more doctors are joining the agitation. In the latest escalation, senior doctors at major hospitals have come out in support, going as far as submitting their resignation letters in protest. What are the issues here? We explain.
Why are South Korean doctors protesting?
The junior doctors said their protests are rooted in the present working conditions and the existing pay. They demand that the government should first address these issues before attempting to increase the number of working physicians in South Korea.

The South Korean government, however, argued that the country needs more working doctors to address the needs of residents in rural parts of the country and meet healthcare demands.
With junior doctors sitting in protest, the functioning of hospitals has also been impacted across the country. A shortage of working doctors has meant that surgical procedures are being cancelled and even emergency rooms have had to turn back patients.
However, doctors have said these issues highlight the workload they have to deal with and that the current system is broken.
According to a Korea Times report, the five biggest hospitals in Seoul — Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul Asan Medical Center, Samsung Medical Center, Severance Hospital and Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital — play a key role in providing medical care for patients in critical conditions. Junior doctors account for 39 per cent of their staff.

Keeping the number of junior doctors high is intentional, mainly because of their lower labour costs, The Korea Times reported.
According to a Reuters report, junior doctors or trainees typically work 80 to 100 hours, five days a week – meaning up to 20 hours a day. Protesting doctors said these working conditions need to be addressed by hiring more senior staff and not increasing the number of trainees or junior doctors.
What has the government said?
The South Korean government has said the increase in the number of doctors is intended to fill an expected shortfall of some 15,000 doctors by 2035. These are significant numbers for a country like South Korea, with a smaller population than India. Following the protests, the government issued a back-to-work order to doctors who walked off the job and vowed to prosecute those who did not comply.
This week, however, the government shifted from its stance and said that it would be “open to dialogue and welcome suggestions to improve its plan,” a report in The Korea Times said. Additionally, the government has also asked the country’s military hospitals and police hospitals to accept civilian patients to prevent further continued disruption of medical services.

But in February, when the protests first started, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol had said the protesting doctors were holding patients “hostage” by their actions. A Korea Times report quoted him as saying: “The government is pushing to reform the country’s health care system”.
He added, “The decision is not negotiable, as adding 2,000 slots (to the number of medical school seats) is deemed a minimal increase to implement the constitutional responsibility of the state to provide timely and proper medical treatment to sick people.”
Despite a softening of the government’s stance, senior doctors at major hospitals in South Korea began submitting their resignations this week in support of medical interns and residents, although they have promised to continue working despite the resignations.
The Korea Times reported that senior doctors have “demanded the government first scrap the decision to increase the medical school quota by 2,000 from the current 3,058, saying it would sit down for talks with the government only if the plan is abolished.”
What the medical community has said

Healthcare in South Korea is among the best in the world, analysts said. Many in the country’s medical community said that the number of doctors is not a problem. According to a Reuters report, South Korea’s medical community believes that the number cited by the government that it wants to use to boost medical admissions is arbitrary and the authorities have not made the basis for that figure open to the public.

The pair briefed each other ""on the present international and regional situation,"" the KCNA said, ""and widely and deeply discussed practical issues for further boosting cooperation to cope with the ever-growing spying and plotting moves by the hostile forces.""
It happened alongside working-level talks between intelligence officials from both sides, according to the report, which said the meetings ""proceeded in a comradely and amicable atmosphere.""
Naryshkin is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, having previously served as Kremlin chief of staff before becoming the speaker of the Russian parliament's lower house. He has been director of the external security service since 2016.
Foreign trips undertaken by senior intelligence officials typically are not publicized in real time unless for signaling purposes.
The Russian Foreign Ministry and North Korea's Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to separate written requests for comment.

Strategic ties between Moscow and Pyongyang go right back to the early days of the Cold War, when the Soviet Union became the first to formally recognize the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948, later backing the North militarily during the Korean War.
Both Russia and North Korea remain heavily sanctioned, the former for its war in Ukraine; the latter for its nuclear and missile programs.
The United States and its allies have accused North Korea of supplying ballistic missiles and thousands of rounds of artillery to Russia for use against Ukraine's forces—both governments deny the charge.
In exchange, South Korea's intelligence suggests, the Kremlin has made good on its promise to assist the North's reconnaissance satellite program and upgrade Pyongyang's Soviet-era military hardware.
Senior U.S. officials said they were ""deeply concerned"" by Putin's growing relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who was invited to tour Russia's main spaceport last fall. Kim recently received a Russia-made limousine as a personal gift from Putin.
Beijing, which historically competed with Moscow for influence in Pyongyang, will be watching how far the strategic ties go.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,287,Coercion tactics on ice as tariffs lifted,"China has done this many times before, but Australia is being lauded as an example in other sanction-hit countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan of how to stand up to Beijing’s bullying.
In South Korea, for example, there is a huge amount of interest from government officials there in how the coercion campaign played out in Australia.
Three years later and Beijing has rolled back most of the restrictions, which left the Australian economy broadly unscathed.
The tariffs certainly hurt many individual Australian exporters and companies, so it would be incorrect to say it was painless. But many exporters found markets elsewhere for their products, while Australia’s overall trade with China has increased in the past three years.
China also further damaged its own reputation by seeking to bully Australia.
Xi is now scrambling to restore investor business confidence in China at a time when its economic growth is slowing as it battles a property crisis, weak consumer confidence and high debt.

This week, he met a group of 20 business leaders from the United States in Beijing where he told them China’s economic prospects remained bright.
Australian executives, including Fortescue’s Andrew Forrest are also in China this week for the Boao Forum for Asia.
While they will hail the abolition of the wine tariffs as a return to the pre-pandemic glory days of doing business with China, the reality is few Australian exporters trust Beijing anymore and the Chinese economy is slowing down anyway. China remains a critical market given its size, but wine exporters do not expect sales to return to the $1.2 billion highs of 2019.
China and Australia appear to be friends again, at least on an economic level. But that could change on a dime.
Even outside anti-dumping probes, Beijing has many other levers to pull such as unofficially ramping up customs inspections.
The Albanese government gets some credit for getting China to back down on wine, although it had to drop its case with the World Trade Organisation to do so which worked in Beijing’s favour.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,290,Commentary: U.S.-led chip alliance could be OPEC-style cartel for digital age,"The U.S., Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are on a mission to restructure the global chip supply chain. The proposed “Chip 4 Alliance” wants to internalize all parts of the semiconductor business—research and development, design, manufacturing, packaging, sales and consumption—in-house. This chip clique will only reach outside the circle in strictly controlled circumstances.
These four economies constitute almost the entire global semiconductor industry, accounting for 82% of the global market share, and 74% of the semiconductor global value chain with 84% of chip design. They collectively occupy a 77% share in the market for manufacturing equipment and as high as 99% for memory chips. Thus, the Alliance is more than just cooperation and coordination: What these four governments determine will shape the global market.
But the Chip 4 Alliance raises a critical and complicated question: Can countries control production and manage trade for a product defined by innovation and competition?
If they can, we’re looking at something very new: an OPEC-style cartel for the digital age.
To the extent that participating members in the Chip 4 Alliance promise to regulate their respective domestic semiconductor industries in a coordinated way, and orient their businesses in a certain direction, this endeavor may introduce something akin to a state-owned enterprise, operated collectively and managed multinationally.
Put bluntly, the four Alliance members can lay out, in the long run, which companies do what, who produces parts and materials, how they are sourced, and where chips are distributed and sold. They will also align their R&D, financial support, and incentives. The chip sector will feature government-arranged financial support, on-going governmental influence, public-private joint business planning, and public mandate fulfilment.
This is none other than a well-known recipe for SOEs, a topic which took center stage in recent trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) or the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Economists have long argued that enterprises under the direction or indirect control of the government sap economic efficiency and hamper market competition.
It’s thus ironic that a new scheme for the global semiconductor industry could create a new type of SOE: the “multinational SOE,” distinct from the national SOEs targeted by by recent regulations and investment agreements.
If key decisions of the semiconductor businesses of the four members are made at the request (if not direction) of respective government agencies, those businesses are presumably set to be a new breed of state enterprise for the digital age.
What’s more, if their business decisions are coordinated and orchestrated by the pool of governments—whether an alliance, network or any other title—they will be virtually under the collective control of the participating governments.
Consider, for example, TSMC’s decision to build fabs in Phoenix, Arizona and Kumamoto, Japan, or Samsung’s new fab in Taylor, Texas. These locations don’t offer the same benefits as TSMC’s home of Taiwan, or Samsung’s home of Korea: less expertise, higher costs and more troublesome regulations. Why, then, did these chip giants decide to invest in the U.S. and Japan? Geopolitics is one obvious possibility.
Granted, the Chinese chip industry has also received a massive amount of financial support from both central and local governments. Beijing raised a semiconductor fund in the amount of $19 billion in 2014 and $27 billion in 2019, respectively. It is now planning to raise a new fund of $41 billion. Clearly a number of Chinese chipmakers can be called SOEs.
Yet endeavors like the Chip 4 Alliance risk creating a behemoth to fight a behemoth. One side may win against the other—then may wither because of stifled innovation and competition.
For chip companies, this whole plan is a Catch-22. In the course of restructuring the global supply chain, chipmakers are encouraged, if not forced, to discuss coordinating business activities with their counterparts. This line of close consultation reveals the Achilles’ heel of global corporations: the web of competition rules and antitrust sanctions in various states.
Members of the Chip 4 Alliance might downplay their competition rules, but non-participating governments, like the European Union, China, or others, might think otherwise when they feel short-changed from a new supply chain.
Semiconductors are just the most high-profile area where countries are using friendshoring to shift away from “countries of concern.” Yet if these policies become the norm, then the global system could end up with much less competition and much less innovation—dominated by a new breed of state-owned enterprise.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,291,U.S. adds new sanctions targeting North Korea's weapons program,"The United States imposed new sanctions on six North Korean individuals and two entities with financial ties to the North's illicit weapons program, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. File Photo by KCNA/EPA-EFE
SEOUL, March 28 (UPI) -- The United States imposed new sanctions on six North Korean individuals and two entities that generate revenue and facilitate financial transactions for the authoritarian regime's illicit weapons program, the Treasury Department announced. The action targets agents of North Korean banks as well as companies that employ North Korean IT workers abroad, the department said in a statement Wednesday. Advertisement
""These actors, operating primarily through networks located in Russia and China, orchestrate schemes, set up front or shell companies and manage surreptitious bank accounts to move and disguise illicit funds, evade sanctions and finance the DPRK's unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs,"" the statement said.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
Among the sanctioned individuals are Yu Pu Ung and Ri Tong Hyok, both China-based representatives of Tanchon Bank. The bank is the financial arm of the Korea Mining Development Corporation, which is the North's ""premiere arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons,"" according to the department.

Russia-based O In Chun, a representative of Korea Daesong Bank, was also sanctioned. The bank is operated by the North's Office 39, which engages in illicit economic activities, manages slush funds and generates revenue for the regime, the department said.
The other sanctioned individuals are China-based Han Chol Man of Kumgang Bank, Russia-based Jong Song Ho of Jinmyong Joint Bank and Jon Yon Gun, who is connected to a newly designated United Arab Emirates real estate company.
The two entities designated Wednesday are Vladivostok-based Limited Liability Company Alis and the UAE's Pioneer Bencont Star Real Estate. Both firms are subordinate to IT firm Chinyong, which manages delegations of North Korean IT workers illegally operating in Russia and Laos.
South Korea also sanctioned four of the individuals and the two entities, its Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
""Today's joint action reflects our commitment to disrupt the DPRK's efforts to generate revenue for its illicit and destabilizing activities,"" Brian Nelson, under secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said. ""The United States, along with our South Korean partners, will continue to take action to safeguard the international financial system and prevent the DPRK from funding its illegal weapons programs.""

The new sanctions come amid growing evidence that North Korea has been able to evade a U.N. Security Council resolution that restricts its oil imports, thanks in large part to its growing relationship with Russia.
Seoul and Washington launched a new task force on Tuesday meant to counter the North's oil smuggling operations, which have increased as part of a weapons deal between Pyongyang and Moscow.
The designations also coincided with a meeting of the U.S.-South Korea Working Group on DPRK Cyber Threats this week, U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday.
The group aims to ""disrupt the North's ability to generate revenue for its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs through cyber-enabled activities,"" Miller said.
Pyongyang funds 40% of its WMD program through ""illicit cybermeans,"" the U.N. Security Council's Panel of Experts estimated in its annual report released this month.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,293,Russia ‘abolishes’ monitoring of sanctions on North Korea with UN veto,"Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Thursday effectively abolishing the monitoring of sanctions against North Korea by UN experts.
Russia’s vote sparked Western accusations that Moscow was acting to shield its weapons purchases from North Korea for use in its war against Ukraine, in violation of sanctions.
Advertisement
The vote in the 15-member council was 13 in favour, Russia against, and China abstaining.
The Security Council resolution sponsored by the United States would have extended the mandate of the panel for a year, but Russia’s veto will halt its operations.
The resolution does not alter the sanctions, which remain in force.
Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the council before the vote that Western nations are trying to “strangle” North Korea and sanctions have proven “irrelevant” and “detached from reality” in reining in its nuclear programme.

US deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the council that Russia’s veto was nothing more than “the attempt by one council member to silence the independent objective investigations” into North Korea’s sanctions violations.
He said Russia acted because “the panel began reporting in the last year on Russia’s blatant violations of the UN Security Council resolutions”.
He warned that Russia’s veto will embolden North Korea to continue jeopardising global security through development “of long-range ballistic missiles and sanctions evasion efforts”.
White House national security spokesman John Kirby condemned Russia’s veto as a “reckless action” that undermines sanctions imposed on North Korea, while warning against the deepening co-operation between North Korea and Russia, particularly as North Korea continues to supply Russia with weapons as it wages its war in Ukraine.

“The international community should resolutely uphold the global non-proliferation regime and support the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal aggression,” Mr Kirby told reporters.
Britain’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia’s veto follows arms deals between Russia and North Korea in violation of UN sanctions, including “the transfer of ballistic missiles, which Russia has then used in its illegal invasion of Ukraine since the early part of this year”.

“This veto does not demonstrate concern for the North Korean people or the efficacy of sanctions,” she said.
“It is about Russia gaining the freedom to evade and breach sanctions in pursuit of weapons to be used against Ukraine.

“This panel, through its word to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,” Ms Woodward said.

The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,294,Hyundai Motor doubles down on EVs as it ramps up investment in Korea,"Open this photo in gallery: People walk through the Hyundai booth at the New York International Auto Show on March 27, in New York City.Spencer Platt/Getty Images
Hyundai Motor Group said on Wednesday it will invest 68 trillion won (US$51 billion) over three years in South Korea to ramp up electric vehicle production and new mobility business and separately hire 80,000 new employees, doubling down at a time when other established auto makers are slowing efforts.
More than half of the investment, or 35.5 trillion won, will be allocated for new research and development infrastructure and assembly lines for EVs, the auto maker said in a statement.
“We are doubling down on electrification,” Hyundai global Chief Operating Officer Jose Munoz said in an interview at the New York auto show. “We’re very committed to the United States market.”
In the U.S., Hyundai said in November it was investing $12.6 billion for new dedicated EV and battery manufacturing facilities in Georgia – the largest investment outside South Korea.
Hyundai Motor Group includes flagship Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia, which together are the world’s number three auto maker by sales. Auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis and Hyundai Engineering & Construction are also under the conglomerate.
Hyundai’s new round of EV investment comes as rival auto makers are slowing plans to expand EV production, and shifting capital to hybrid models or bigger share buybacks and dividends for investors.
In 2021, General Motors said it planned to spend more than $35 billion on EV projects through 2025, and would prioritize accelerating EVs over near term profits. But last year, the U.S. auto maker delayed a planned electric truck factory and slashed its projected EV output.
GM last year said it would spend $10 billion to buy back shares, and CEO Mary Barra has indicated there could be more buybacks. Stellantis has also promised to return more cash to shareholders rather than increase investments in EVs.
Ford, which three years ago outlined $30 billion in EV spending through 2030, has since slashed production plans for its F-150 Lightning electric truck and shifted workers to build more gasoline-powered Bronco SUVs. Ford is now “right-sizing the capacity and investments we are putting into EVs,” Chief Financial Officer
John Lawler said Tuesday
.
Toyota, the world’s largest auto maker by vehicle sales, is adding more EVs to its lineup, but the Japanese auto maker has put more emphasis on increasing sales of gas-electric hybrids. Investors have cheered that choice, sending Toyota shares up nearly 50% so far this year.
Munoz said Hyundai also sees a slowdown in the pace of electrification, but added the Korean auto maker will maintain its plans but remain flexible, including the rollout of plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Hyundai on Wednesday showed off its 2025 Tucson SUV and will launch both hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions this summer.
“The only difference is we still see EVs in the long run as the way we are going to see the biggest growth,” he said.
Hyundai expects to begin producing EVs in Georgia in October to allow them to qualify for $7,500 tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act – ahead of its initial schedule, Munoz said. Hyundai, which saw U.S. EV sales double last year, will soon announce what EVs it will build in Georgia, he added.
Among the projects encompassed in the new investment plan announced Wednesday are the overhaul of a Kia factory for production of a compact EV that will be “produced and sold domestically and internationally.”
In 2025, a second factory will start producing “PBV” vehicles – a reference to a purpose-built EV. Hyundai showed prototypes of PBVs used as commercial vehicles at this years CES show in Las Vegas.
Hyundai’s Ulsan factory will begin mass producing “ultra-large” Genesis luxury EVs in the first quarter of 2026, the company said.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,295,North Korean TV censors blur out pants of British gardening show host,"Jack Guy and Yoonjung Seo, CNN
North Korea’s state broadcaster, KCTV, has blurred out a pair of jeans worn by veteran British TV host Alan Titchmarsh as part of the country’s censorship of foreign fashion and culture.
KCTV carried an episode of Titchmarsh’s show “Garden Secrets,” originally aired on the BBC in 2010, on Monday.
At one point he can be seen kneeling in a flowerbed, and keen-eyed viewers will notice that the lower half of his body has been blurred to obscure the jeans he is wearing.
Titchmarsh told the BBC that the censorship had given him some “street cred.”
“I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist - I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it’s given me a bit of street cred really hasn’t it?” he said.
Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul, told CNN that the censorship shows North Korea is strictly implementing the newly adopted Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act.
“The act aims to prohibit North Korean residents from imitating foreign countries in various aspects, including how they’re dressed and speak,” he said.
He added that jeans have been banned for residents as a symbol of American imperialism, but some flexibility has been applied to foreign visitors because they can’t prevent them from wearing jeans.
Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said the censorship is part of a fight against “anti-socialist culture and ideology.”
“Blue jeans are associated with ‘decadent’ Western culture, as they were in the Soviet Union, and Kim Jong Il ordered officials to rid the country of them back in the 1990s,” he said.
“They have had campaigns against anti-socialist culture since at least the early 1990s,” said Ward. “The intensity of these campaigns has increased, especially since 2020.”
The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act was introduced that year, banning the population from distributing, watching or listening to any cultural content deemed to be anti-socialist.
Violations are punishable by years of hard labor for small quantities of banned material and even death for larger amounts.
At that time, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that the law prevents “the introduction and dissemination of anti-socialist ideology and culture….so that North Koreans can protect their own ideology, spirit, and culture.”
For decades, North Korea has been comparatively closed off from the rest of the world, with tight restrictions on free expression, free movement and access to information.
Its dismal human rights record has been criticized by the United Nations. Internet use is heavily restricted; even the privileged few who are allowed smartphones can only access a government-run, heavily censored intranet.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,297,"FTSE Holds Off Adding South Korea, India to Key Bond Indexes","(Bloomberg) -- FTSE Russell said South Korea will continue to stay on the watch list for inclusion to its global bond index — and India for the emerging-market equivalent — once more delaying the countries’ addition to the key indexes by at least another six months.
The index provider “will continue to monitor the positive developments in the South Korean government bond market towards the successful fulfillment"" of the criteria, FTSE said in a statement on Wednesday.
It also acknowledged progress in “the accessibility of the Indian government bond market,"" but said the Indian market still doesn’t satisfy certain criteria.
South Korea has been keen to get the index upgrade since FTSE added the country to its watch list for potential inclusion in September 2022. The move is expected to draw as much as 90 trillion won ($66.7 billion), according to the Korean government, citing estimates from investment banks.
Korean authorities have been intensifying efforts to improve the country’s market systems to court more foreign investors, most recently letting some global investors participate in the local interbank currency market. The government is also testing out extended trading hours of the local won market, ahead of its official extension due in July.
Meanwhile, India still doesn’t meet criteria including increased regulatory reporting and the tax clearance process, FTSE said. Both countries were not included on the indexes when they were last last reviewed in September, 2023.

The country was added to the watch list in September 2018 for possible reclassification to secondary emerging markets, but the index compiler had said its progress has been slower than anticipated, in part due to Covid. A pre-funding requirement is the key hurdle to an upgrade, investors say.
The index compiler also retained Pakistan on the watch list for potential demotion to frontier market status from secondary emerging market amid a steady decline in its index weight over the past few years.

March 27 (UPI) -- An ostrich escaped from a zoo in South Korea and was caught on camera running through traffic on a busy road before being recaptured.
The male ostrich, named Tadori, escaped from a zoo called Bug City in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, and was seen running through busy roads before being cornered and safely recaptured in the parking lot of a storage building.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,299,US and Ally Move To Block North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program,"The U.S. and South Korea have kicked off a task force aiming to stem the flow of resources that could aid North Korea's advancing nuclear and missile programs.
The bilateral Enhanced Disruption Task Force (EDTF) held its first meeting on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., marking the beginning of its bid to counter North Korean efforts to bypass sanctions, the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
The EDTF was created amid concerns over Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost his nuclear arsenal.
Last year, the North Korean leader called for the regime to ramp up production of warheads, defying the United Nations Security Council's wide-ranging sanctions. In a report published Wednesday, North Korea-focused analysis group NK Pro featured satellite imagery showing new construction at a suspected nuclear complex.
The inaugural EDTF meeting saw the participation of more than 30 officials ranging in expertise from intelligence and diplomacy to maritime interdiction and sanctions, Yonhap News cited South Korea's foreign ministry as saying.
Attendees stressed the importance of cooperation on cracking down on the country's ability to obtain petroleum, including from Russia, that fuels North Korea's weapons programs and overall military readiness.
Also discussed were methods of countering North Korean efforts to import refined petroleum in excess of the 500,000 barrel annual cap set by the United Nations Security Council.
North Korean tankers were estimated to have smuggled up to three times that amount between January and September 15 of last year, according to U.N. experts.

Companies and persons who play a part in smuggling this resource into the reclusive country should be punished with independent sanctions, task force members agreed, per Yonhap News.
EDTF will explore a variety of methods of disrupting Pyongyang's oil procurement channels.
These include exposing its ""sanctions evasion activities, reviewing options for autonomous sanctions designations, and engaging private sector and third-party actors throughout the region who facilitate—either knowingly or unwittingly—the DPRK's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) oil procurement networks,"" the State Department said, using North Korea's official name.
The North Korean embassy in China did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
The new analysis of satellite imagery showed workers have been building an annex along an alleged uranium enrichment site near Pyongyang. NK Pro pointed out the structure is similar in size to facilities construct to house centrifuges at the Yongbyon nuclear plant in 2013 and 2021.
In September, Kim gave the order to ""exponentially increase nuclear weapons production to realize all kinds of nuclear strike methods and deploy them to various military branches.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,300,US Ally Scrambles Jets To Intercept Chinese Spy Drone,"The Japanese Defense Ministry said it scrambled fighter jets on Tuesday to intercept a Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle in the Sea of Japan, in what was the first known operation in the area by China's long-range spy drone.
A Newsweek map, recreated using data released by the Joint Staff of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, shows the flight path of the WZ-7 reconnaissance UAV, which Tokyo said was detected in the waters on the morning of March 26.
The Chinese military drone entered the Sea of Japan—known in both Koreas as the East Sea—via the continental area and later returned in a northwesterly direction following a circular patrol, the report said, suggesting the sortie most likely overflew the territory of North Korea or Russia, which both border the sea.
Japan said it scrambled unspecified fighter aircraft to monitor the UAV, which did not violate Japanese airspace. Air Self-Defense Force jets were also dispatched to head off other possible airspace violations in the East China Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, the Joint Staff said.
The Japanese Defense Ministry said it would ""continue to pay close attention to military movements and maintain the utmost vigilance,"" according to the Kyodo news agency.
China's Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to multiple written request for comment.

Little is know about the WZ-7 Soaring Dragon, which is built by the state-owned drone maker Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corp. and first unveiled in 2021 at the Zhuhai air show in southern China, where it was also displayed the following year.
The UAV's silhouette is identifiable by its unique joined-wing design—visible in the photo captured by Japan's pilots.

Analysts describe the WZ-7 as China's answer to the U.S. Air Force's RQ-4 Global Hawk, a high-altitude, long-endurance reconnaissance drone built by Northrop Grumman. However, the extent of the Chinese aircraft's capabilities remain unclear.
""The primary mission is expected to be aerial reconnaissance, but it may also be fitted to provide targeting data for anti-ship ballistic missiles and cruise missiles,"" the U.S. Army's ODIN military database says.
Available research states both the Chinese air force and navy operate a handful of the turbojet-powered UAV, which has been seen at China's disputed Himalayan border with India as well as in Taiwan's air defense zone.
A 2018 report by the investigative outfit Bellingcat said China had stationed WZ-7 drones at the Yishuntun air base in northeastern Jilin province, on the border with North Korea.
In January 2023, Japanese radars detected a WZ-7 flying a sortie from the East China Sea into the Western Pacific via the strategic Miyako Strait, the drone's first publicly reported foray beyond the so-called first island chain.

Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force sent the missile boat Hayabusa, the lead ship in its class, and a P-3C Orion patrol aircraft to shadow the Russian navy ship, the report said.
The Kareliya is in service with Russia's Pacific Fleet, headquartered in the Peter the Great Gulf in the Sea of Japan. The same vessel was monitored by the U.S. Coast Guard after appearing off the Hawaiian islands early last year.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia in September and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. File Photo by Kremlin Pool/UPI | License Photo
SEOUL, March 27 (UPI) -- The United States and South Korea launched a task force to counter North Korea's illicit oil smuggling operations, both governments said Wednesday, as Russia appears to be helping the isolated regime circumvent U.N. sanctions. The new Enhanced Disruption Task Force held its inaugural meeting on Tuesday in Washington, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Advertisement
""The two sides discussed how DPRK imports of refined petroleum in excess of the U.N.-mandated cap violate U.N. Security Council resolutions and support the DPRK's unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs,"" the statement said.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
Of particular concern is the growing relationship between Russia and North Korea, which officials say has led to an exchange of weapons for oil.
The allies ""underscored the need for close collaboration to disrupt the DPRK's ability to illicitly procure excess petroleum, including petroleum from Russia, as this activity directly contributes to the DPRK's military readiness and the development of its weapons programs,"" the State Department said.

The task force meeting included more than 30 officials from ministries and agencies covering diplomacy, intelligence, sanctions and maritime interdiction, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement.
""Oil is an essential resource for North Korea's nuclear and missile development and military posture,"" the ministry said.
A U.N. Security Council resolution passed in 2017 limits the amount of refined petroleum that North Korea can import to 500,000 barrels per year.
However, Pyongyang has long used illicit means to skirt the restrictions. The Security Council's Panel of Experts estimated in its annual report released last week that North Korea imported more than 1.5 million barrels of refined oil from January to September last year.
North Korea, meanwhile, has shipped around 7,000 containers of munitions to Russia since July for use in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said last week.
Shin estimated that Russia has sent more than 9,000 containers back to North Korea in return, carrying food, as well as raw materials used for producing munitions. He also suggested that Russia was providing North Korea with fuel, noting a significant uptick in military exercises since the start of the year.
An analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday by British think tank Royal United Services Institute and the Financial Times shows further evidence of a fuel exchange, with at least five North Korean tankers traveling to collect oil products from Vostochny Port in Russia's Far East in March.

The tankers could have moved up to 125,000 barrels of refined petroleum products -- a quarter of the U.N.'s annual oil cap -- in less than three weeks, the RUSI analysis said.
The U.N.'s Panel of Experts, which monitors North Korean sanctions, is also facing an uncertain future due to resistance from Security Council members Russia and China. A vote to extend its mandate was scheduled to be held last Friday but had to be postponed due to ""long, difficult, and contentious"" negotiations instigated by Moscow and Beijing, who are pushing for sunset clauses in the sanctions regime, according to the independent think tank Security Council Report.",2024-03-27 09:57:00,https://www.upi.com,UPI News,301,united south korea task force week counter illicit oil north korea allegedly picked wake deepening north leader kim un russia met president file photo kremlin license march 27 united south korea task force counter north illicit oil smuggling said russia helping isolated regime circumvent un new enhanced disruption task force inaugural meeting u state department said statement two side refined petroleum excess unmandated cap violate un security council support unlawful ballistic missile statement democratic republic korea official name north particular concern growing relationship russia north korea say led exchange ally need close collaboration disrupt ability illicitly procure excess petroleum petroleum russia activity directly military readiness development state department task force meeting included 30 covering diplomacy intelligence maritime interdiction south foreign ministry said separate essential resource north nuclear missile development military posture ministry un security council resolution 2017 amount refined petroleum north korea import 500000 per long used illicit skirt security panel annual report last week north korea 15 million refined oil last korea meanwhile shipped around 7000 munition russia since use invasion south defense minister shin said last russia sent 9000 back north korea return carrying food well raw used munition also russia providing north korea fuel significant military since start analysis satellite imagery think tank royal united institute financial time evidence fuel exchange least five north traveling collect oil port far east could 125000 refined petroleum quarter annual oil cap le three analysis panel north also facing uncertain future due resistance security council russia china vote extend mandate last due long difficult contentious pushing sunset regime according independent think tank security council report u south korea launch task force thwart north oil smuggling

Hippos are massive animals that live in Africa. They are the third largest land mammals on earth. Only elephants and white rhinos are larger. They can reach an incredible 4.9m (16 feet) in length and a mass of 1500kg (3,300lb). Due to their aggression and their size, adult hippos are rarely preyed upon. Young hippos are occasionally taken by lions or crocodiles. Surprisingly, the hippo's closest relatives are whales and dolphins. Aquatic mammals like whales evolved from land animals that were very similar to the hippo. Originally, it was believed that hippos were closely related to pigs due to molar structure and other similarities, but DNA and fossil records have c hanged this line of thinking in the past century.
Hippos are most active at night, roaming the shallows along riverbeds in Africa. They are herbivores, eating aquatic vegetation, and occasionally farm crops, which contributes to conflict with humans. Known to be aggressive, even when not provoked, hippos will occasionally charge humans or boats.
The hippo produces a red oil, as can be seen on these sunbathing adults, which acts as a sunblock, protecting them from UV rays.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,304,North Korean TV censors British gardening show host’s jeans,"CNN —
North Korea’s state broadcaster, KCTV, has blurred out a pair of jeans worn by veteran British TV host Alan Titchmarsh as part of the country’s censorship of foreign fashion and culture.
KCTV carried an episode of Titchmarsh’s show “Garden Secrets,” originally aired on the BBC in 2010, on Monday.
At one point he can be seen kneeling in a flowerbed, and keen-eyed viewers will notice that the lower half of his body has been blurred to obscure the jeans he is wearing.
Titchmarsh told the BBC that the censorship had given him some “street cred.”
Titchmarsh, pictured during the KCTV broadcast BBC/KCTV
“I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist - I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it’s given me a bit of street cred really hasn’t it?” he said.
Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul, told CNN that the censorship shows North Korea is strictly implementing the newly adopted Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act.
“The act aims to prohibit North Korean residents from imitating foreign countries in various aspects, including how they’re dressed and speak,” he said.
He added that jeans have been banned for residents as a symbol of American imperialism, but some flexibility has been applied to foreign visitors because they can’t prevent them from wearing jeans.
Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said the censorship is part of a fight against “anti-socialist culture and ideology.”
“Blue jeans are associated with ‘decadent’ Western culture, as they were in the Soviet Union, and Kim Jong Il ordered officials to rid the country of them back in the 1990s,” he said.
“They have had campaigns against anti-socialist culture since at least the early 1990s,” said Ward. “The intensity of these campaigns has increased, especially since 2020.”
The Reactionary Ideology and Culture Rejection Act was introduced that year, banning the population from distributing, watching or listening to any cultural content deemed to be anti-socialist.
Violations are punishable by years of hard labor for small quantities of banned material and even death for larger amounts.
At that time, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that the law prevents “the introduction and dissemination of anti-socialist ideology and culture….so that North Koreans can protect their own ideology, spirit, and culture.”
For decades, North Korea has been comparatively closed off from the rest of the world, with tight restrictions on free expression, free movement and access to information.
Its dismal human rights record has been criticized by the United Nations. Internet use is heavily restricted; even the privileged few who are allowed smartphones can only access a government-run, heavily censored intranet.

Korean Central Television (KCTV) aired a 2010 episode of Alan Titchmarsh’s Garden Secrets, where footage of the British broadcaster was obscured from the waist down as he knelt in a garden bed tending to plants.
Jeans are seen as a symbol of Western imperialism and are banned under the North Korean regime.
Titchmarsh told the BBC that the news had given him ""a bit of street cred"".
""It’s taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart.
""You know, wearing trousers that are generally considered by those of us of a sensitive disposition to be rather too tight.""
He said that his jeans were not too tight but were not acceptable in North Korea.
He added: ""I’ve never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist. I’m generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually, it’s given me a bit of street cred, really, hasn’t it?""
Jeans have been prohibited since the 1990s when leader Kim Jong-il declared them to be a symbol of Western, and specifically US, imperialism, which had no place in a socialist state, according to Seoul-based outlet NK News.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,306,"Atomic clocks to ensure one-nation, one time","NEW DELHI : India is deploying atomic clocks across the country to ensure the time shown on your digital watch, smartphone and laptop is truly based on Indian Standard Time—an effort launched more than two decades ago after the Kargil war.
Currently, most software operating modules in India rely on US-based Network Time Protocol servers. The government wants all software to instead be synchronised with indigenous atomic clocks, both for uniformity in time and as a defence mechanism, especially in times of war.
The atomic clocks are being installed by the consumer affairs ministry’s Legal Metrology Department and the National Physical Laboratory, or NPL—the nation’s timekeeper. So far, India has atomic clocks at Ahmedabad and Faridabad and more are being installed at Bhubaneswar, Jaipur and Hyderabad as well, according to three officials aware of the development.
“The installation and testing of all atomic clocks will be completed by the end of June,"" one of them said.
Once the exercise is completed, all computers, smartphones, digital watches, and digital radios will have Indian time managed by NPL and the consumer affairs ministry’s Regional Reference Standard Laboratories, ensuring “one nation, one time"", this person said.
The project was initiated after the Kargil war when India was denied information on the GPS location of Pakistani intruders, a second person said. “The importance of having our own time is significant, especially in areas like defence security, cybersecurity, and online transactions. Even a small time gap can be crucial in such situations.""
The consumer affairs ministry didn’t immediately reply to queries on the developments.
Only four other countries—the US, the UK, Japan, and Korea—have their own atomic clocks.
The government, through the consumer affairs ministry, is developing a legal framework to mandate that all software service providers across the country synchronise their time with the atomic clocks developed by the National Physical Laboratory, said the first person quoted above.
Failure to comply may result in severe penalties, including the cancellation of licences.
“Currently, accurate time-keeping is done through satellite… (the) consumer affairs ministry and NPL are working on a plan to connect all atomic clocks through optical cable as it will be more secure, given that satellite-based time dissemination is susceptible to potential blockage by enemy countries during wartime or emergencies,"" said Venu Gopal Achanta, director of CSIR-NPL.
The optical cable-laying work would be completed in about six months, he added.
“The Indian Space Research Organisation is utilising the NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) constellation for the dissemination of time across the country with an uncertainty of 20 nanoseconds,"" Achanta said. “With this, every corner of the country will have Indian Standard Time.""",2024-03-26 18:30:00,https://www.livemint.com,Livemint,306,new atomic across country ensure time shown digital watch truly based standard effort two ago operating rely network time protocol government instead indigenous atomic uniformity time defence mechanism especially time atomic consumer legal metrology department national physical laboratory timekeeper far atomic well according three aware installation testing atomic end june one exercise digital digital time consumer regional reference standard one nation one time person project war information location second person said importance time significant especially like defence security even small time gap crucial consumer ministry didnt immediately reply four u japan atomic government consumer ministry legal framework mandate service across country time atomic national physical laboratory said first person comply may result severe cancellation accurate done satellite … consumer ministry working plan connect atomic optical cable secure given time dissemination susceptible potential blockage enemy wartime said director optical work would six space research regional navigation satellite system constellation dissemination time across country uncertainty 20 said every corner country standard time atomic ensure one time
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,308,Investors eye South Korea and India as money exits China,"Cash flows south, too
And it’s not just the emerging markets that have benefited, with a wave of cash from China also piled into Australia’s sharemarket. This has fuelled a dazzling rally in the nation’s biggest banks and helped send the S & P/ASX 200 to a record earlier this month.
Hasan Tevfik, senior analyst at MST Marquee, told The Australian Financial Review earlier this month that a re-weighting out of China had benefited other markets in the region such as India and Australia.
Northcape Capital’s emerging markets portfolio manager Ross Cameron said the money pulled from China was also being reinvested in South Korea and Japan, which had helped push the Nikkei above 41,000 points for the first time in history.
Mr Cameron said one of the reasons for the influx of money was improvements in corporate behaviour with a “greater focus on return on equity and credit discipline” in both countries.
In particular, he pointed to South Korea’s government reforms to boost shareholder returns, as Seoul aims to replicate Japan’s success in boosting stock valuations with a corporate governance drive and tax incentives.

“The discount at a number of companies in South Korea are trading below book value – it’s even higher than Japan,” Mr Cameron said.
He said that the focus on shareholder returns enhanced the prospects for South Korean companies, which were among the world’s largest manufacturers of technology. Memory chipmakers such as Samsung Electronics and SK hynix were also very “positively exposed” to artificial intelligence, he added.

“These are mega AI plays … I think South Korea is the obvious beneficiary in the region,” he said.
Antipodes’ John Stavliotis, who oversees the firm’s emerging markets fund, has also turned more bullish on South Korea, saying the corporate governance reforms would be a “catalyst to realise value”.
He noted that around 70 per cent of stocks in South Korea were trading on less than one times book value because it had pretty low returns on equities. In other words, they’re trading cheaper than the value of the company’s underlying assets.

“It remains early days, but South Korea is a very cheap market with a lot of companies that have very rich cash balance sheets,” said Maple-Brown Abbott’s lead portfolio manager, Will Main.
He said South Korea was benefitting from China’s outflows and was set to benefit from the reforms, but a broader tax reform needed to be implemented.
“There’s still a bit of uncertainty but when we met with the Korean regulator; a couple of weeks ago they appeared committed to implementing this program,” he said.
India attracts cash
Beyond South Korea, Antipodes Mr Stavliotis said India’s sharemarket was by far the biggest beneficiary of China’s outflows.
Abrdn’s Asian equities investment manager Xin-Yao Ng also said he had been “dipping back” into the Indian sharemarket after a recent pullback.

MSCI India Index booked a 19.2 per cent rally last year and has continued to rise 4.7 per cent year-to-date.
“Though [we are] doing that cautiously and selectively because we think, in most parts within the smaller cap space, valuations still seem high even after the correction,” said Mr Ng, who is based in Singapore.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,309,"US Ally Wants to Meet Kim Jong Un 'as Soon as Possible,' North Korea Says","Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio has expressed that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un ""as soon as possible,"" the North Korean leader's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, said Monday, according to state media.
But just a day after hinting that such a summit was possible—pending a ""decision"" by Japan—Kim changed course, saying Pyongyang would ""reject all contact and negotiations"" over Tokyo's continued concerns over abductees and the Kim regime's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Last month, the Financial Times reported that Kishida hoped for dialogue with Kim, the first of its kind in two decades, in a bid to boost his flagging domestic approval rating. A major focus of the meeting would be the status and possible release of the Japanese nationals North Korea kidnapped in the 1960s and 70s, the report said.
Kim Yo Jong, who is the vice department director of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee and has been tipped as her brother's possible successor, appeared to indicate last month that the regime was open to a bilateral talk provided Japan stops raising concerns over North Korea's ""legitimate right to self-defense"" and the ""already settled abduction issue.""

Japan, South Korea and the U.S. have frequently protested the North's ballistic missile tests and advancing nuclear weapons program.
Despite having signaled the reclusive country's conditional willingness to meet, Kim Yo Jong did an apparent about-face on Tuesday in a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency.
""Japan has no courage to change history, promote regional peace and stability and take the first step for the fresh DPRK-Japan relations, she said, referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""It was the Japanese side that knocked at the door first requesting 'the Japan-DPRK summit without preconditions' and the DPRK only clarified its stand that it would welcome Japan if it is ready to make a new start, not being obsessed by the past.""
Newsweek reached out to the North Korean Embassy in China and Prime Minister Kishida's office with written requests for comment.
In her statement on Monday, Kim Yo Jong said the Japanese prime minister had reached out about the potential summit through ""another channel"" than would typically be used.
She appeared to leave the door open to the summit but said the Japanese government had to make a ""political decision"" before bilateral ties could improve.
If Japan is considering interfering in North Korea's sovereignty, for instance with the ""abduction issue,"" then Kishida's outreach is ""little short of a bid for popularity"" and North Korea will view the country as an enemy rather than a friend, she said.
However, if the Japan ""respects the former's sovereignty and security interests"" on fair and equal footing, North Korea's ""strengthened self-defense capability will never be a threat to the security of Japan,"" she added.",2024-03-26 17:50:24,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek,309,prime minister expressed meet kim un soon possible north powerful sister kim yo said according state day summit decision course saying would reject contact continued kim ballistic missile nuclear month financial time hoped dialogue kim first kind two bid boost flagging domestic approval rating major focus meeting would status possible release north korea 1960s 70 report yo vice department director ruling central committee tipped possible successor indicate last month regime open bilateral talk provided japan raising north legitimate right already settled abduction leader kim un sister kim yo attend summit peace house 27 2018 south korea kim yo said march 25 north leader kim un sister kim yo attend summit peace house 27 2018 south korea kim yo said march 25 north korea would refuse contact japan day said prime minister eager meet brother korea summit press pool via south korea u frequently ballistic missile advancing nuclear reclusive conditional willingness meet kim yo apparent statement carried central news courage change history promote regional peace stability take first step fresh said north official name democratic republic side door first summit without stand would welcome japan ready make new start north embassy china prime minister office written statement kim yo said prime minister potential summit another channel would typically leave door open summit said government make political decision bilateral could japan considering interfering north sovereignty instance abduction issue outreach little short bid popularity north korea view country enemy rather friend japan sovereignty security fair equal footing north capability never threat security japan added u ally meet kim un soon possible north korea

Want all the best bits on the box? Share your email to get TV news, interviews, spoilers and more
Alan Titchmarsh's jeans were blurred out on North Korean television because they were seen as too 'Western'. The 74-year-old presenter's BBC show, Garden Secrets, is popular in North Korea, but his choice of trousers caused a stir.
Since the early nineties, jeans have been banned in the country because they're seen as a symbol of US imperialism. In the episode, which first aired in the UK in 2010, Alan was seen gardening while wearing a checked shirt and jeans.
While his shirt was deemed suitable for North Korean viewers, his jeans were not and were blurred out on screen, reports the Mirror. The episode about the 17th-century Hatfield House gardens has been shown several times since 2022.

According to NK News, former leader Kim Jong Il once told citizens that jeans are ""absolutely verboten and people should not wear them under any circumstances."" Kim Jong-un has warned about letting in ""bourgeois culture"" and ""anti-socialist behaviour"".
Alan showed astonishment once at his programme being broadcast in North Korea. He said: ""I never imagined that my programmes would reach North Korea, but hopefully the calming nature of British gardening will be well received there.""
Last year, news circulated that the current leader of North Korea had prohibited things such as skinny jeans, mullet hairstyles, and certain types of body piercings. This followed alerts that more efforts needed to be made to prevent ""capitalistic culture"" from influencing their nation.

A story was published by Rodong Sinmum, the official newspaper of the North Korean government, conveying worries over young people adopting Western styles. The article stated, based on reports, that: ""We must be wary of even the slightest sign of the capitalist lifestyle and fight to get rid of them,"" Kim Jong-un's fashion guidelines were reportedly put in place to squash ""anti-socialist behaviour"". The country ruled by communists was said to only permit 15 approved haircuts, banning all others.
It is alleged Mr. Kim penned a letter published in the state media urging the national Youth League to clamp down on ""unsavoury, individualistic, anti-socialist behaviour"" among youths.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,311,North Korea Images Spark Nuclear Fears,"North Korea has again started work to expand a site believed to be a nuclear facility close to the country's capital city, according to new analysis, as the secretive nation's leadership becomes bolder in its nuclear rhetoric and tensions with its southern neighbor skyrocket.
A ""new annex"" is under construction at the Kangson site near Pyongyang, believed by some analysts to be a North Korean uranium enrichment site, according to NKPro, a project run by the U.S.-based NK News website.
The new area, which the outlet said was identified from satellite imagery, is just over a fifth of the size of the current main building, according to their analysis, adding it was built in the past month. Newsweek reached out to the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office in Geneva via email for comment.
The Kangson site was identified as a likely uranium enrichment compound in 2018. The Diplomat reported at the time that U.S. intelligence had been monitoring this site for more than 10 years.
But a report published by North Korean analysts with 38 North in late 2020 suggested Kangson may not be a uranium enrichment site, but a facility manufacturing parts centrifuges. Centrifuges, however, can be used to enrich uranium and then used as nuclear fuel.
NEW: North Korea expanding suspected uranium enrichment site, satellite imagery shows https://t.co/4c13yywWBd — NK NEWS (@nknewsorg) March 26, 2024
Satellite imagery previously suggested in 2021 that North Korea was expanding its uranium enrichment plant at the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Facility complex, north of Pyongyang. This could be laying the groundwork to ""increase production of nuclear materials for weapons production,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN in September 2021.
Recent months have seen Pyongyang and its leader, Kim Jong Un, become more daring in nuclear saber-rattling as relations with South Korea frayed to their worst point in decades.
North Korea has shifted from an official policy of reconciliation with South Korea, declaring Seoul to be a sworn enemy. South Korea and Japan have expressed grave concerns about North Korea's military activity, calling Pyongyang's actions a severe threat to their national security and turning to the U.S. for support—something that has angered North Korea.
North Korea has said it is upping weapons production and test-fired a host of new weapons capable of carrying nuclear weapons, from an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to an ""underwater nuclear weapons system"" supposedly capable of unleashing a nuclear tsunami on North Korea's adversaries. In September, North Korea said it had debuted its first ""tactical nuclear attack submarine"" able to carry and launch nuclear weapons.
There is some doubt among Western analysts about the submarine's true capabilities, but North Korea has also launched a spy satellite and committed to putting several more into orbit this year.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,312,Genesis unveils its take on the big luxury EV-the Neolun Concept,"Genesis provided train tickets from Washington to New York and accommodation so Ars could attend its event. Ars does not accept paid editorial content.
NEW YORK—You can always rely on Genesis to bring at least one interesting concept to the New York International Auto Show. This year, the company brought several. At a busy reveal at the brand's Genesis House in Manhattan, it showed us its high-performance ambitions with not one but four bright orange machines, plus one rather famous Belgian racing driver. Then, in a chamber reminiscent of The Barmacide Feast, we got to see the poshest Genesis yet, the brand's take on a big luxury electric vehicle inspired by Korean hospitality.

Genesis was tight-lipped in the lead-up to Monday night's unveilings, but no one was entirely surprised to see a big electric SUV. Genesis is owned by Hyundai Group, after all, and has access to the E-GMP architecture, a thoroughly up-to-date flexible platform that keeps impressing us. Kia just used E-GMP to great effect to make the EV9, a three-row family SUV. And Hyundai's take on that form factor is due later this year in the production Ioniq 7, so an upmarket model from Genesis seemed obvious.

""The last eight years, it was about finding who we are and then discovering DNA for the Genesis,"" said SangYup Lee, global design head for Genesis. ""Now it's time to expand.""
It's a much cleaner design than I was expecting—between its smoothed edges and those monoblock wheels, you might get some Mercedes Maybach vibes. The proportions look right, though. ""We made it with an obsession to detail in every single dimension of the vehicle,"" Lee explained.
Genesis says it's learned enough about engineering the pillarless ""coach doors"" that ""its application to production vehicles is now feasible."" (These doors are commonly known ""suicide doors,"" a term the auto industry prefers to avoid using in marketing.) Running boards emerge out of the sides when the doors are open, then slide back to minimize drag once they close again. There are retractable roof rails as well.
The concept is strictly a four-seater, with front seats that can swivel through 180 degrees to face the rear. There's lots of purple leather and indigo-dyed cashmere and a dark wood floor to the cabin. Entertainment screens fold down from the roof for the rear passengers, and the interior is warmed by radiant heat via ""heating films applied to the dashboard, door trims, floor, seatbacks and console sides,"" Genesis said.
""Everybody challenges the technology, but at the end of it, how you execute it is more important,"" said Lee. ""Neolum gives another level of experience for customers. You will experience technology throughout all different five senses,"" he told us.
A production version hasn't been officially confirmed, but Lee said he expected Genesis to release a flagship SUV ""sooner than later.""",2024-03-26 16:07:53,https://arstechnica.com,Ars Technica,312,genesis provided train new york accommodation could attend event accept editorial always rely genesis bring least one interesting concept new york international auto show year company brought several busy reveal genesis house u one four bright orange plus one rather famous racing driver chamber reminiscent feast got see genesis yet take big luxury electric vehicle inspired night one entirely see big electric genesis group access architecture thoroughly flexible platform u used great effect make ev9 family take form factor due later year production 7 model genesis last eight finding genesis said lee global design head genesis time much cleaner design might get look right though made obsession detail every single dimension vehicle lee learned enough engineering coach application production feasible commonly known suicide term auto industry avoid marketing running emerge side open slide back minimize drag close retractable roof concept strictly front swivel 180 face rear there lot purple leather cashmere dark wood floor cabin entertainment fold roof rear interior warmed radiant heat via heating applied dashboard door floor console side genesis technology end execute important said lee another level experience experience technology throughout different five told production version officially confirmed lee said genesis release flagship sooner later genesis take big luxury concept
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,313,"Soccer-Iraq, Australia progress in World Cup qualifiers as South Korea win","Iraq and Australia ensured their progress to the third round of Asia's 2026 World Cup preliminaries on Tuesday with wins against the Philippines and Lebanon respectively, while South Korea edged closer with a 3-0 win over Thailand.
The Iraqis notched up their fourth victory in a row to advance as Jesus Casas' side handed the Philippines a 5-0 thumping in Manila. Aymen Hussein scored twice in the first half, either side of a goal from Amir Ali Ammari, while former Manchester United midfielder Zidane Iqbal and Zayed Tahseen were on target in the 61st and 77th minutes respectively.
The win moves Iraq onto 12 points in Group F, nine clear of third placed Vietnam, who suffered a damaging 3-0 loss in Hanoi against Indonesia. That result strengthens Indonesia's hopes of a place in the next round as Shin Tae-yong's team consolidate their hold on second place in the group ahead of the Vietnamese with two games remaining.
Jay Noah Idzes gave the visitors the lead in the ninth minute and further goals from Rangar Oratmangoen and Muhammad Sananta sealed a key success for the South East Asians. The top two finishers in each of the nine groups advance to the next round of qualifying, which will see 18 teams battle for Asia's eight guaranteed berths at the first-ever 48-team World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States in 2026.
Craig Goodwin scored twice as Australia also progressed in a 5-0 win over Lebanon in Canberra that confirmed the Socceroos would advance from Group I with maximum points from four games. Palestine, meanwhile, sit in second place with seven points after securing a 1-0 victory over Bangladesh.
Michel Termanini scored two minutes after Amid Mahajna's 92nd minute sending off for a second yellow card to move the Palestinians five points ahead of third-placed Lebanon. The South Koreans, meanwhile, put Thursday's disappointing draw with Thailand in Seoul behind them in the return clash in Bangkok with Lee Jae-sung, Son Heung-min and Park Jin-seop netting in a 3-0 win in Group C.
Lee bundled his effort over the goal line in the 19th minute following Cho Gue-sung's centre and Son doubled the lead nine minutes after the interval from Lee Kang-in's incisive pass. Park completed the win eight minutes from time with a close-range volley after Kim Min-jae had headed Kim Jin-su's cross into his path.
China moved into second in the group with a 4-1 win against Singapore, with Wu Lei scoring twice to take Branko Ivankovic's side onto seven points from four games, three ahead of the third-placed Thais.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,314,"North Korea trying to excite Japan with leaders’ summit, but Kishida faces difficult choices","TOKYO – North Korea has been tempting Japan with the prospect of a visit to Pyongyang by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for the first leaders’ summit in 20 years – but with a massive catch.
Tokyo must accept Pyongyang’s weapons programme and treat its abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s as a resolved issue for such a summit to be held, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) cited leader Kim Jong Un’s influential sister Kim Yo Jong as saying on March 25.
Mr Kishida has said he is open to meeting Mr Kim with no preconditions. But Ms Kim rubbished the idea of any summit unless Tokyo first agrees to terms that it has long considered non-negotiable.
Implying that a summit cannot be a mere photo op to boost Mr Kishida’s awful domestic support, she was quoted as saying: “Just because the Prime Minister wants to, does not mean he can meet our country’s leadership.”
In a separate development that goes against the grain of tentatively warmer ties, North Korea suddenly scrapped a World Cup qualifier against Japan that was to have been played at Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Stadium on March 26. Japan won the reverse tie in Tokyo 1-0 on March 21.
Mr Kishida’s approval ratings at home are languishing, and critics believe an unlikely meeting with Mr Kim would allow him to portray himself as a consummate diplomat.
This could give him a quick boost in support, as time is running out before a ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership contest that will be called in September 2024.
Observers said the Prime Minister faces difficult choices: He may give an inch, but sentiment will turn even further against him if Mr Kim ends up taking a mile.
“The big question is whether Kishida has the strong determination and conviction to assert that – despite all the concerns and risks – it was important to advance the relationship between Japan and North Korea at this point,” Professor Atsuhito Isozaki, an expert on North Korea issues at Japan’s Keio University, told The Straits Times.
A senior government official told the Asahi newspaper that North Korea was trying to excite Japan, adding: “We should be careful not to overreact, or else we would play into their hands.”
Nothing in public statements by either side suggests the needle has shifted from their respective entrenched positions.
Japan regards North Korea – with which it has neither normalised relations nor made reparations for World War II – as a pariah state, even as leaders since the late Mr Shinzo Abe have said they were open to a summit without preconditions.
In January, Mr Kim extended a surprise olive branch to Mr Kishida in a historic condolence message after a 7.6-magnitude New Year’s Day earthquake struck the Noto Peninsula, even referring to the premier as “Your Excellency”.
On March 25, Ms Kim divulged that Mr Kishida had recently made approaches “through another channel” other than the usual diplomatic routes to convey his hopes of meeting Mr Kim “as soon as possible”.
This prompted a rare acknowledgement from Tokyo that it has been lobbying for a summit through “various routes”. Even then, top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed that it was “totally unacceptable” for Tokyo to accept Pyongyang’s word that the abduction issue has been resolved.
Mr Kishida, meanwhile, told reporters: “Nothing has been decided so far on whether a summit will be realised.”
As it stands, both countries hold intractably divergent views.
Tokyo demands that Pyongyang commits to achieving complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation and a resolution of the abduction issue before it will normalise ties and mete out wartime reparations.
Pyongyang, however, says its ballistic missile and nuclear programme is necessary for self-defence and insists the abduction issue has long been resolved.
Pyongyang admitted in 2002 that its agents had kidnapped Japanese citizens between the 1970s and 1980s to teach the Japanese language and culture to North Korea’s spies. Their identities were also stolen and used by agents for espionage.
While there are hundreds of suspected victims, Japan formally recognises 17 abductees. But North Korea maintains there were 13 abductees, with the other four having never entered the country.
Five were returned in 2002 after the historic first summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who offered Tokyo a formal apology.
This was followed by a second summit two years later, when family members including the North Korean-born children of the five returnees were brought to Japan.
Pyongyang insists the others are dead and says the matter has long been resolved.
Mr Takuya Yokota, 55, the brother of high-profile abductee Megumi who was snatched from Niigata in 1977 when she was 13, leads a support group for the families of other abductees. He said: “We cannot compromise on our demand that all abductees be immediately returned to Japan.”
Additionally, the geopolitical situation has drastically changed since Mr Kim met then South Korean President Moon Jae-in and then United States President Donald Trump in a flurry of summits from 2018 to 2019. This may have affected the diplomatic calculus.
South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol and his US counterpart Joe Biden, however, are antipathetic towards Pyongyang.
Mr Kim has stepped up North Korea’s war readiness as he declared the abandonment of the goal of unification with South Korea. KCNA reported on March 25 that he supervised a tank exercise by the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division – the first military unit that reached Seoul in a surprise attack in 1950 that triggered the Korean War.
Concurrently, ties between Japan and South Korea are blossoming, while their trilateral partnership with the US is being strengthened.
North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programme has advanced by leaps and bounds since 2002, when the abduction issue was top of the agenda.
Pyongyang has launched a military reconnaissance satellite into space, and now possesses intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of striking the US. It has also flown missiles over Japanese territory into the Pacific Ocean.
Ms Kim said on March 25 that Pyongyang will treat Tokyo as its “forever enemy and never friend” if Japan remains hostile. But she added that its arsenal will “never be a threat to the security of Japan”, so long as Tokyo respects North Korea’s sovereignty and legitimate security interests.
Prof Isozaki noted that there has been no change to North Korea’s policy to strengthen its military capabilities, making it extremely unlikely for Mr Kishida to extract any concessions.
Japan’s most-read newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, questioned in a commentary if North Korea was trying to drive a wedge between the US and its two allies in its charm offensive.
“Kishida should not take advantage of the matter for the sake of his own political ambition,” the commentary said. “If he does, it may cause a political and diplomatic disaster in Japan, South Korea and the United States, undermining the trilateral relationship.”",2024-03-26 15:36:55,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times,314,north korea tempting japan prospect visit prime minister first summit 20 massive must accept treat 1970s 1980s resolved issue summit central news agency leader kim influential sister kim yo saying march 25mr said open meeting kim kim idea summit unless first long considered summit mere photo boost awful domestic support saying prime minister mean meet separate development go grain tentatively warmer north korea suddenly scrapped world cup qualifier japan kim sung stadium march 26 japan reverse tie 10 march 21mr approval home languishing believe unlikely meeting kim would allow portray consummate could give quick boost support time running ruling liberal democratic party leadership contest 2024observers said prime minister difficult may give inch sentiment turn even kim taking big question whether strong determination conviction assert despite important advance relationship japan north korea point professor expert north korea university told senior government official told newspaper north korea trying excite japan careful else would play public either side needle respective north korea neither made world war pariah state even since late said open summit without kim extended surprise olive branch historic condolence message 76magnitude new day earthquake struck peninsula even premier march 25 kim recently made another channel usual diplomatic convey meeting kim soon rare summit various even top government spokesman totally unacceptable accept word abduction issue meanwhile told nothing decided far whether summit hold intractably divergent complete verifiable irreversible resolution abduction issue mete wartime however ballistic missile nuclear necessary abduction issue long admitted 2002 1970s 1980s teach language culture north also stolen used suspected japan formally 17 north korea 13 four never returned 2002 historic first summit prime minister north leader kim formal second summit two later family north five brought dead matter long 55 brother snatched 1977 13 support group said compromise demand immediately returned geopolitical situation drastically since kim met south president moon united president trump flurry 2018 2019 may affected diplomatic president u counterpart joe however antipathetic towards kim stepped north war readiness declared abandonment goal unification south korea march 25 tank exercise 105th tank division first military unit surprise attack 1950 triggered japan south korea trilateral partnership u nuclear ballistic missile advanced since 2002 abduction issue top military reconnaissance satellite space intercontinental ballistic capable striking u also flown territory pacific kim said march 25 treat forever enemy never friend japan remains hostile added arsenal never threat security japan long north sovereignty legitimate security noted change north policy strengthen military making extremely unlikely extract newspaper commentary north korea trying drive wedge u two ally charm take advantage matter sake political ambition commentary said may cause political diplomatic disaster japan south korea united undermining trilateral relationship north korea trying excite japan summit difficult
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,315,North Korea censors Alan Titchmarsh's trousers on BBC gardening show,"North Korea's state TV channel has censored Alan Titchmarsh's trousers.
On Monday, Korean Central Television was showing an episode of the 2010 BBC series of Gardening Secrets, featuring the famous gardener and broadcaster.
The show was said to be a condensed version of the original, and at one point broadcasters blurred out Mr Titchmarsh's jeans.
In the scene Mr Titchmarsh is kneeling in a garden, tending to plants, when the blurred effect is applied to his legs.
It doesn't hide the fact he's wearing trousers, just obscures them. The BBC first revealed the move.
The censoring is said to be linked to Kim Jong Un's regime's efforts to restrict Western fashion and culture in North Korea, NKNews reports.
Blue jeans are said to be a sign of the West, according to the outlet, and have been essentially banned since the 1990s.
This is despite the country briefly exporting designer jeans to Sweden.

The update is only available in South Korea at the moment, but it's expected that Samsung will release it in other countries in the next few days.
This all builds on Samsung's February update for the Galaxy S24, which included patches for better zoom, portrait mode, night mode and rear camera video capture capabilities. However, that update was primarily focused on solving issues with the vivid display mode on the phone.

When Samsung revealed the details of the Galaxy S24 cameras, there were complaints that the developer had skimped on the camera hardware for the phone as the cameras between the Galaxy S24 and the Galaxy S23 were almost identical. However, Samsung did add several new processing and editing features through Galaxy AI, the S24 series' headline update.
Galaxy AI offers a wealth of editing and upscaling options for the Galaxy S24 series. For instance, users can use the Magic Editing Tool to clean up or expand photos with ease, or add slow-mo sections to any video with a tap of the screen.
The Galaxy S24 Ultra is currently No. 2 on our best camera phones of 2024 buit it lost to Apple's flagship in our iPhone 15 Pro Max vs Galaxy S24 Ultra camera shootout. However, Samsung clearly isn't standing still and these upgrades could make a big difference. We will be sure to test them out once the update becomes available and report back.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,318,"North Korea says no interest in holding summit with Japan, rejects further talks","With no prompting from me whatsoever — out of the blue — a freshly retired and otherwise mild-mannered electrical engineer that I have known for 50 years from western Pennsylvania opined to me this past Friday about Donald Trump’s classified documents trial.
That my friend was so completely pissed off about a federal district court proceeding in Florida tells you everything you need to know about the pivotal moment we face as a nation.
Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, has routinely demonstrated herself to be a jurist of significant incompetence and ignorance, culminating last week when she issued an order to defense lawyers and prosecutors that, according to the Washington Post, “badly misstates the law and facts of the case.”

Well before Cannon became the presiding judge in Trump’s classified documents and obstruction of justice case, she had been under legal scrutiny for how she handled jurisdictional discretion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
So let’s step back a couple of years and move forward from there to best understand why Cannon today is not fit to preside over Trump’s case.
It all began when Cannon “ let loose with a decision breathtaking in its disregard for both the law and the judicial branch’s legitimacy .”
Back in September 2022, Cannon issued two rulings on the government’s investigation into the missing documents.
One ruling was to appoint a “special master” to review the materials seized by the FBI . The other was to “temporarily enjoin” the Department of Justice from any further examination of hundreds of boxes of missing documents belonging to the National Archives and Records Administration that had been scattered about Mar-a-Lago. Trump’s winter home and country club in Palm Beach, Fla.
At the time, Amanda Marcotte, senior politics writer for Salon and author of Troll Nation : How the Right Became Trump-Worshipping Monsters Set on Rat-F-----g Liberals, America, and Truth Itself (2018), enunciated that Cannon’s “ruling employs the same logic as the Big Lie and the Capitol insurrection.”
Cannon had ruled affirmatively on Trump’s behalf in response to his lawyers filing a spurious civil action to block the Department of Justice from using evidence lawfully obtained following the execution of a FBI search warrant.

These two rulings or orders by Cannon were the first of several controversial ones to come. They have been poorly, if not, unlawfully adjudicated with respect to both the facts and the law. Her decisions notably have included the jury being allowed to see classified documents and the names of government witnesses released to the public.
Most recently, the judge asked for proposed jury instructions from the parties that allow for the defense to assert that Trump could have declassified documents without using the normal declassification procedures where there would have been an official record.
Also, rather than ruling against Trump’s motion to dismiss the case, Cannon deferred based on some parts of the Espionage Act, which allows it to be litigated again sometime in the future.

These rulings have been needlessly slowing down the wheels of justice for the better part of two years and a trial date has yet to be established. As Philip Rotner has written for The Bulwark , Cannon “is trying to kill the Trump documents” case “one cut at a time” as she keeps demonstrating that she may be Trump’s “last and perhaps only line of defense.”
Even before the unanimous per curiam decision by the 11 th Circuit vacated her order to appoint a special master to oversee the review of the classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago, legal observers were accusing the judge of “obstruction of justice.” These critics were also thinking out loud that Cannon has already demonstrated that she should recuse herself for cause.
The vacating of Cannon’s order was less than two weeks after Attorney General Merrick Garland had announced his appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith on November 18, 2022, to oversee the two ongoing investigations initiated earlier by the Department of Justice.
After dragging his feet for the better part of two years, Garland — in appointing Smith — did what he should have done when he was sworn into office back on March 11, 2021, one month after the Republican Senate had “jury nullified” the impeachment of Trump for a second time.

In any event, these two criminal cases have never been the “witch hunts” that Trump and his allies claim. Then again, the former president and his supporters may be correct that without Trump having declared himself running once again for the presidency less than 48 hours before, the special counsel appointment may never have happened.
Whatever the reality might have been, on June 8, 2023, in Florida, a federal grand jury indicted Trump. The case was randomly “reassigned” to Cannon with a one in three probability. After a “superseding indictment” was filed on August 1, Trump found himself facing 37 charges related to the illegal possession of classified documents and the obstruction of justice.
The amended indictment added three more charges alleging Trump and his two co-conspirators had sought to delete what could well be very incriminating security footage of the classified documents being moved around Mar-a-Lago and off of the property as well.
When Cannon was “bench-slapped” by the 11th Circuit many in the prosecutorial world thought that Smith should file a motion asking her to recuse. These former prosecutors and other legal commentators were all keenly aware of the downside for doing so especially in relation to delaying the case further.
Since Trump was criminally indicted, Cannon has continued to issue legally questionable and unsound rulings. Cannon’s “malfeasance” in fact has interjected an accumulation of unnecessary delays for the trial of Trump and his two co-defendants, property manager Carlos De Oliveira and bodyguard Walt Nauta.
Back in November, Cannon’s “ unwarranted animus towards the government ” was on full display according to former U.S. prosecutor Joyce Vance when prosecutors alerted the judge that Trump’s lawyers were “playing both sides against the middle” or gaming the system to acquire more delay. Rather than chastise the defense or at least both sides, Cannon only chastised the government.
With respect to one of the judge’s rulings early last month to “ unseal the identities of two dozen potential witnesses, along with sensitive information they provided to the government ,” special counsel Smith, on Feb. 8, asked for a reconsideration and stay because of a “clear error” and “manifest injustice.”
Once again legal commentators chimed in and were recommending Smith make a motion for Cannon to recuse.
After needlessly hearing oral arguments a week ago last Thursday, Cannon issued an absurdly reasoned two-page order . This ruling by the judge may very well be the straw that breaks the judge’s back so to speak.
On the one hand, Cannon rebuffed Trump’s lawyers’ argument that the central statute in the indictment, the Espionage Act, “ was impermissibly vague and should be struck down entirely .”
On the other hand, the judge ruled without prejudice which means that it could be raised again at trial. Which means that either the jury or Cannon could dismiss the entire case against Trump and his co-defendants should they find grounds for doing so. If that were to occur, the government could neither appeal the decision to a higher court nor could they try the case again because of the double jeopardy clause.
With respect to the making or not making of a motion to recuse Cannon, until the most recent decisions, Smith was damned if he did make such a motion and damned if he did not.
In the former, it would mean a delay whether the motion succeeded or failed. And if it succeeded that would mean an even longer delay as the next judge would need time for getting up to speed. Which in all likelihood would push any classified documents trial to after the 2024 election. In the latter, it would mean going into trial with the possibility of losing the case all because of a f----d up ruling by the judge.
In sum, whether one thinks the judge’s rulings are bad, biased, corrupt, perplexing or simply incompetent, they are sabotaging the administration of justice and making a mockery of the rule of law.

On March 13, a federal grand jury indicted Rajesh Kumar Kapoor on one count of abusive sexual contact, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release Monday.
If convicted of the charge, Kapoor faces up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
The incident happened on Jan. 16, when Kapoor allegedly touched the victim’s breasts and inner thigh without her consent, prosecutors said, citing the indictment.
On Monday, Kapoor was arrested, made his initial court appearance and was released pending trial.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,321,Alginate-based hydrogel developed for treatment of retinal detachment,"It's taboo to consume seaweed soup before exams in Korea since it can lead to failing the exam. The belief is rooted in the idea that the slippery nature of seaweed may cause people to slip and falter during the test. The slick surface of seaweeds such as seaweed and kelp is attributed to alginate, a mucilaginous substance. Notably, an intriguing study exploring the use of alginate for the treatment of retinal detachment has been recently published.
A collaborative effort between Professor Hyung Joon Cha from the Department of Chemical Engineering and the School of Convergence Science and Technology and Dr. Geunho Choi from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), and Professor Woo Jin Jeong, Professor Woo Chan Park, and Professor Seoung Hyun An from the Dong-A University Hospital's Department of Ophthalmology has resulted in the creation of an artificial vitreous body for treating retinal detachment. This solution is based on a natural carbohydrate derived from algae. The research findings were recently published in Biomaterials, an international journal of biomaterials published by Elsevier.
The vitreous body is a gel-like substance that occupies the space between the lens and retina, contributing to the eye's structural integrity. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the inner wall of the eye and moves into the vitreous cavity, leading to detachment and potentially resulting in blindness in severe cases. While a common approach involves removing the vitreous body and substituting it with medical intraocular fillers like expandable gas or silicone oil, these fillers have been associated with various side effects.
To address these concerns, the research team employed a modified form of alginate, a natural carbohydrate sourced from algae. Alginate, also known as alginic acid, is widely utilized in various industries, including food and medicine, for its ability to create viscous products. In this research, the team crafted a medical composite hydrogel based on alginate, offering a potential alternative for vitreous replacement.
The hydrogel, possessing high biocompatibility and optical properties akin to authentic vitreous body, enables patients to preserve their vision post-surgery. Its distinctive viscoelasticity effectively regulates fluid dynamics within the eye, contributing to retinal stabilization and the elimination of air bubbles.
To validate the hydrogel's stability and effectiveness, the team conducted experiments using animal models, specifically rabbit eyes, which closely resemble human eyes in structure, size, and physiological response. Implanting the hydrogel into rabbit eyes demonstrated its success in preventing the recurrence of retinal detachment, maintaining stability, and functioning well over an extended period without any adverse effects.
Professor Hyung Joon Cha of the POSTECH who led the study remarked, ""There is a correlation between retinal detachment and severe myopia and the prevalence of retinal detachment is increasing, particularly in young people. The incidence of retinal detachment cases in Korea rose by 50% in 2022 compared to 2017."" He expressed the team's commitment by saying, ""Our team will enhance and progress the technology to make the hydrogel suitable for practical use in real-world eye care through ongoing research.""
The worldwide market for intraocular fillers is expanding at a rate of 3% per year."" He added, ""We anticipate that the hydrogel we've created will prove beneficial in upcoming vitreoretinal surgeries."" Professor Woo Jin Jeong, Dong-A University Hospital

Shohei Ohtani is set to make his first public comments Monday since his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired following allegations of illegal gambling and theft from the Los Angeles Dodgers star.
Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers last week when the team opened the season with two games against the San Diego Padres in Seoul, South Korea.
Mizuhara was let go from the team following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker and claims from Ohtani’s attorneys that the Japanese star had been the victim of a “massive theft.”
Major League Baseball has opened an investigation of the matter. The Internal Revenue Service has confirmed that Mizuhara and Mathew Bowyer, the alleged illegal bookmaker in Orange County, California, are under criminal investigation.
Mizuhara told ESPN he had gambling debts that totaled well over $1-million and initially said Ohtani had paid those off at Mizuhara’s request. He later changed his story, telling ESPN that Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers. Ohtani’s attorneys have said Ohtani was the victim of a “massive theft.”
The Associated Press has been unable reach Mizuhara for comment. It is not clear if he has an attorney. Mizuhara was with the team in South Korea up until his firing. It’s unknown if he left the country.
Will Ireton, the Dodgers’ performance operations manager, has taken over translation duties for Ohtani. He previously did the same for then-Dodgers pitcher Kenta Maeda, who is Japanese.
On Sunday, Manager Dave Roberts endorsed Ohtani addressing the matter publicly. He said it was the two-way superstar’s decision to do so.
“It’s the right thing to do,” Roberts said. “I’m happy he’s going to speak and speak to what he knows and give his thoughts on the whole situation. I think it will give us all a little bit more clarity.”
Ohtani is also expected to play in exhibition games Monday in Los Angeles and Tuesday in Anaheim, where he was a two-time AL MVP before leaving the Angels as a free agent to sign a record $700-million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in December.
Roberts said Ohtani has not addressed his teammates as a group.
“I think that he’s had one-off conversations with players,” Roberts said.
The manager said he checked in with Ohtani to see how he’s doing.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,326,North Korea's Kim Jong Un Doubles Down on Hostility With South,"North Korea has dismantled an influential organization formed to promote eventual reunification with the South, with Pyongyang-Seoul relations at their most fraught in decades.
During a Saturday meeting of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea's Central Committee, members decided the DFRK was no longer necessary at a time of hostility with ""principal enemy"" Seoul and formally dissolved it, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday.
The nearly eight-decades-old DFRK was the latest result of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's campaign to purge any references to a reunification with the South. A formal peace treaty between the two countries has never been signed despite the end of open hostilities in 1953, when the Korean War ended.
The move comes after Kim declared that continuing to pursue a rapprochement with Seoul was no longer possible and that Pyongyang should amend its constitution to brand the South as its ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy.""
In January, the country's rubber-stamp parliament abolished several organizations involved in what limited inter-Korean cooperation existed, including the one handling relations with the South.
During Saturday's meeting, it was determined that Seoul was not a ""partner for reconciliation and reunification"" but rather ""the most hostile state, invariable principal enemy and completely foreign country."" Central Committee members reached a consensus to dissolve the DFRK.
North Korea's embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Bong-geun Jun, a nonresident senior advisor for Northeast Asia at the United States Institute for Peace, wrote last month that the North's shift away from talk of reconciliation indicates that Pyongyang realizes it has lost the ""unification competition.""
""Historically, unification is possible only when the stronger country absorbs the weaker one militarily or peacefully. Today, South Korea is a leading middle power, while North Korea is an isolated rogue state,"" Jun wrote.
Established in 1946, the DFRK was a political alliance in North Korea aimed at promoting the reunification of Korea under North Korea's terms.
It functioned primarily as a tool for the Korean Workers' Party to unify domestic support for its policies and vision of Korean reunification, which emphasized the North's leadership over the entire peninsula without foreign intervention, particularly from the United States.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,327,North Korea claims Japanese PM requested summit with Kim Jong Un,"Kishida’s request is unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo, which has historically strained relations.
Kishida expressed a desire to improve ties, which Pyongyang has hinted it is not opposed to.
Analysts suggest that North Korea’s statement could be an attempt by Pyongyang to negotiate terms for a future summit.

On Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s powerful sister stated that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has requested a summit with her brother. She added that a meeting was unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo. Historically strained relations between the two countries include a long-running kidnapping dispute and North Korea’s banned weapons programs, but Kishida has recently expressed a desire to improve ties, hinting at Pyongyang’s non-opposition.
Last year, Kishida stated that he was willing to meet Kim “without any conditions,” asserting that Tokyo was ready to resolve all issues, including the abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, which remains an emotive issue in Japan.
“Kishida… conveyed his intention to personally meet the President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as soon as possible,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.
Last month, Kim Yo Jong — one of the regime’s key spokespeople — hinted at a possible future invitation for the Japanese leader to visit North Korea.
However, she emphasized that the “history of the DPRK-Japan relations gives a lesson that it is impossible to improve the bilateral relations full of distrust and misunderstanding,” without a substantive policy change on Tokyo’s part.
She warned that if Japan were to remain “engrossed in the abduction issue that has no further settlement,” then Kishida’s hopes of improving ties would not materialize.

On Monday, Kishida stated that he was not aware of the KCNA report and did not directly comment on its contents while emphasizing the importance of top-level talks with North Korea.
“For Japan-North Korea relations, top-level talks are important to resolve issues such as the abduction issue,” Kishida said in parliament, referring to kidnappings that took place in the 1970s and ‘80s.
“This is why we have been making various approaches to North Korea at the level directly under my control, as I have said in the past.”
In 2002, North Korea admitted to sending agents to kidnap 13 Japanese people in the 1970s and ’80s, whom they used to train spies in Japanese language and customs.
The abductions remain a potent and emotional issue in Japan, and many suspect that officials have not recognized the full extent of the abductions.
Analysts have long stated that contention over the issue could hinder progress toward a summit between Kishida and Kim Jong Un.

However, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, suggested that North Korea’s statement seemed to be an attempt by Pyongyang to negotiate terms for any future summit between the two countries’ leaders.
“It seems the North sees there’s no point in making contact with the Japanese side without checking what requirements each side has in mind that could lead to nothing after all if those requirements are too different to reconcile,” Hong said.
“It is Pyongyang’s way of testing how serious Japan is in holding the meeting and setting its summit prerequisites to host the meeting.”
While in office in 2002, Japan’s former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made a landmark visit to Pyongyang, where he met with Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, and outlined a path to normalize relations, involving Japan offering economic assistance.
The trip resulted in the return of five Japanese nationals and a subsequent visit by Koizumi. However, the diplomacy soon broke down, partly due to Tokyo’s concern that North Korea was not being transparent about the abduction victims.
Kim Yo Jong said that Kishida “should not think that he can meet our state leadership when he has wanted and decided.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,328,Japan’s Kishida ‘proposed’ summit with Kim Jong Un,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the North urged Japan to show sincerity toward improving bilateral ties and realizing their countries’ first summit in about 20 years.
Japan’s government did not immediately respond to the North Korean announcement. In the statement carried by state media, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said Kishida used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person at an early date.
Kim Yo Jong said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government raises the issue of Japanese citizens abducted to North Korea in past decades and opposes what she described as the North’s “exercise of sovereign rights,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
Open to talks
In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement on bilateral ties, saying North Korea was open to improving relationships with Japan and even inviting Kishida to Pyongyang. But she said those would be possible only if Tokyo “drops its bad habit of unreasonably pulling up (North Korea) over its legitimate right to self-defense and does not lay such a stumbling block as the already settled abduction issue.”
Kishida has said previously that he believes a summit with Kim Jong Un is important in various ways, including solving the problem of the abducted Japanese citizens. Japanese media reported he said he wasn’t aware of the North Korean announcement when he was asked about it in parliament Monday.
Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken a trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants better ties with North Korea to increase his declining approval rating at home.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,329,North Korea says Japan’s PM Kishida has requested summit with Kim Jong Un,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's powerful sister said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has requested a summit with her brother, adding a meeting was unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo.
Relations between the two countries are historically strained, including by a long-running kidnapping dispute and North Korea's banned weapons programs, but Kishida has recently expressed a desire to improve ties, which Pyongyang has hinted it is not opposed to.
Last year, Kishida said he was willing to meet Kim ""without any conditions"", saying Tokyo was willing to resolve all issues, including the abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, which remains an emotive issue in Japan.
""Kishida... conveyed his intention to personally meet the President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as soon as possible,"" Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.
Kim Yo Jong -- who is one of the regime's key spokespeople -- had hinted last month at a possible future invitation for the Japanese leader to visit North Korea.
But she said the ""history of the DPRK-Japan relations gives a lesson that it is impossible to improve the bilateral relations full of distrust and misunderstanding,"" without a substantive policy change on Tokyo's part.
She warned that were Japan to remain ""engrossed in the abduction issue that has no further settlement"" then Kishida's hopes of improving ties would not materialize.
Kishida said Monday that he was not aware of the KCNA report, and did not directly comment on its contents, while calling top-level talks with North Korea ""important"".
""For Japan-North Korea relations, top-level talks are important to resolve issues such as the abduction issue,"" Kishida said in parliament, referring to kidnappings that took place in the 1970s and '80s.
""This is why we have been making various approaches to North Korea at the level directly under my control, as I have said in the past.""
- Kidnapping issue -
North Korea admitted in 2002 that it had sent agents to kidnap 13 Japanese people in the 1970s and '80s who were used to train spies in Japanese language and customs.
The abductions remain a potent and emotional issue in Japan and suspicions persist that many more were abducted than have been officially recognized.
Sakie Yokota, 88, whose daughter Megumi is among the missing abductees, told Japanese media on Monday that she wanted the two countries to hold talks ""as soon as possible"".
""I don't know if talks will take place, because it's North Korea, but I hope even a small step will be made. We really don't have much time left,"" she said.
Earlier this month, Atsuhito Isozaki, a North Korea expert and professor at Keio University, told reporters it would be ""extremely hard"" for Japan to accept the North's claim that the abduction issue is resolved.
The question ""is whether Kishida can convince the Japanese public that Japan-North Korea relations are very important,"" to the extent that it is necessary to make some concessions to improve bilateral ties.
Japan's former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi paid a landmark visit to Pyongyang while in office in 2002, meeting Kim's father Kim Jong Il and setting out a path to normalize relations in which Japan would offer economic assistance.
The trip led to the return of five Japanese nationals and a follow-up trip by Koizumi, but the diplomacy soon broke down, in part over Tokyo's concern that North Korea was not coming clean about the abduction victims.
North Korea's statement appeared to be an attempt by Pyongyang to negotiate terms for any future summit between the two countries' leaders, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, told AFP.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,330,Kim Jong Un visits tank unit; North Korea says Japan wants summit,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea, the North’s state media said Monday.
Kim made those comments Sunday while visiting his top tank group, the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division. The unit’s name marks how it was the first North Korean military unit to reach the South Korean capital in 1950 when a North Korean surprise attack triggered a war that dragged on for almost four years.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have heightened after Kim in past months dialed up his military demonstrations, including tests of nuclear-capable missiles designed to target South Korea, the United States and Japan, while issuing threats of nuclear conflict against its rivals.
Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and updating their deterrence plans built around strategic U.S. assets.
Also Monday, North Korea said that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida offered to meet with Kim “as soon as possible,” but stressed that prospects for their countries first summit in about 20 years would depend on Tokyo tolerating its weapons program and ignoring its past abductions of Japanese nationals.
In a parliamentary session, Kishida said that a meeting with Kim is “crucial” to resolve the abduction issue, a major sticking point in bilateral ties, and that his government has been using various channels to hold the summit.
Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said in a statement that Kishida recently used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person “as soon as possible.”
She said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government is engrossed in the abduction issue and interferes in the North’s “exercise of our sovereign right,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken the trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants to use possible progress in the abduction issue to increase his declining approval rating at home.
North Korea and Japan don’t have diplomatic ties, and their relations have been overshadowed by North Korea’s nuclear program, the abduction issue and Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Japan’s colonial wrongdoing is a source of on-again, off-again history wrangling between Tokyo and Seoul, as well.
There are concerns North Korea could further dial up pressure on its rivals and intensify its weapons testing activities in what is an election year in both the United States and South Korea. Kim Jong Un has supervised a series of missile tests and other military drills this year.
Photos published by North Korean state media on Monday showed Kim talking with military officers at an observation post and tanks with North Korean flags rolling through dirt, with at least one of the vehicles carrying a sign that read: “Annihilate U.S. invaders who are staunch enemies of the Korean people!”",2024-03-25 08:52:12,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News,330,north leader kim un tank exercise armored sharpen war face growing south korea state medium said made visiting top tank group 105th tank division name first north military unit reach south capital 1950 north surprise attack triggered war dragged almost four peninsula kim past military designed target south korea united japan issuing nuclear conflict strengthening combined military deterrence built around strategic u north korea said prime minister meet kim soon possible first summit 20 would depend program past parliamentary session said meeting kim crucial resolve abduction issue major sticking point bilateral government various hold sister senior official kim yo said statement recently used unspecified channel convey position meet kim un person soon said breakthrough north long government engrossed abduction issue exercise sovereign right apparently testing say north korea seeking improve japan way weaken trilateral security partnership also use possible progress abduction issue increase approval rating korea japan dont diplomatic north nuclear program abduction issue 191045 colonization peninsula colonial wrongdoing source history north korea could dial pressure intensify testing election year united south korea kim un series missile military north state medium kim talking military observation post north rolling dirt least one carrying sign read annihilate u staunch people kim un tank unit north korea japan summit

SEOUL, March 25 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's influential sister said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has requested a summit ""as soon as possible,"" but warned that Tokyo would have to steer clear of contentious issues for any meeting to take place. According to Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, the Japanese prime minister reached out through an unspecified channel with the request. Advertisement
""Shortly ago, Kishida, through another channel, conveyed his intention to personally meet the President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as soon as possible,"" she said in a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.
Kishida has publicly called for a summit on several occasions. At a policy speech in January, he said he wanted to meet with Kim to help raise Japan-North Korea relations to a ""new stage"" and resolve the longstanding issue of the North's abductions of Japanese citizens.
The prime minister also brought it up at the U.N. General Assembly last year, saying he was determined to meet the North Korean leader face-to-face without any conditions.

Kim Yo Jong issued a response in February, signaling that North Korea was open to improving relations and potentially hosting a visit from Kishida.
However, she cautioned at the time that Tokyo would have to drop its criticisms of Pyongyang's illicit missile and nuclear programs and set aside the abduction issue before any steps could be taken.
On Monday, she again warned Japan against ""interfering in the exercise of our sovereign right [or] being engrossed in the abduction issue that has no further settlement.""
""If Japan truly wants to improve the bilateral relations and contribute to ensuring regional peace and stability as a close neighbor of the DPRK, it is necessary for it to make a political decision for strategic option conformed to its overall interests,"" Kim said.
She added that the nuclear-armed North would never pose a threat to Japan ""if the latter respects the former's sovereignty and security interests in a fair and equal stand.""
Kishida told parliament on Monday that he was not aware of the media reports on Kim's comments, but reiterated that his government was still pursuing a summit.
""Top-level talks are important in order to resolve various issues such as the abduction issue,"" Kishida said, according to broadcaster NHK. ""As I have said in the past, we have been making efforts to encourage this.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,332,South Korea protests: Senior doctors to submit resignations in support of strikes,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Senior doctors at dozens of hospitals in South Korea planned to submit their resignations Monday in support of medical interns and residents who have been on a strike for five weeks over the government’s push to sharply increase medical school admissions, their leader said.
The senior doctors’ action won’t likely cause an immediate worsening of hospital operations in South Korea because they have said they would continue to work even after submitting their resignations. But prospects for an early end to the medical impasse were also dim, as the doctors’ planned action comes after President Yoon Suk Yeol called for talks with doctors while suggesting a possible softening of punitive steps against the striking junior doctors.
About 12,000 interns and medical residents have faced impending suspensions of their licenses over their refusal to end their strikes, which have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals.
They oppose the government’s plan to increase the country’s medical school admission cap by two-thirds, saying schools can’t handle such a steep increase in students and that it would eventually hurt South Korea’s medical services. But officials say more doctors are urgently needed because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world.
In a meeting with ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon on Sunday, representatives of medical professors and doctors at some 40 university hospitals — where the junior doctors work while training — expressed support for the striking doctors, saying the government’s recruitment plan “would collapse our country’s medical system,” Kim Chang-soo, head of the emergency committee at those universities, said Monday.
Kim called Yoon’s overture a positive step but said the current standoff between doctors and the government won’t be resolved unless the government rolls back its recruitment plan.
He said doctors at the universities were expected to stick to earlier plans to submit resignations voluntarily and cut back their working hours to 52 hours per week — the maximum weekly number of legal working hours. Observers say senior doctors have been grappling with excessive workloads after their juniors left their hospitals.
“If the government has an intention of withdrawing its plan or has an intention of considering it, we’re ready to discuss all pending issues with the government before the public,” Kim said.
After Sunday’s meeting, Han asked Yoon’s office to “flexibly handle” the issue of planned license suspensions for the striking doctors. Yoon then asked his prime minister to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors, according to Yoon’s office.
It’s unclear whether and how soon the government and doctors would sit down for talks and reach a breakthrough. Some observers say the government’s likely softening of punishments for the striking doctors and its pursuit of dialogue with doctors were likely related to next month’s parliamentary elections as further disruptions of hospital operations would be unhelpful for ruling party candidates.
The striking junior doctors represent less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors, and critics say that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to a rise in the number of doctors.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.",2024-03-25 07:59:24,https://apnews.com,The Associated Press,332,south korea senior south korea submit support medical strike five push sharply increase medical school leader senior action wont likely cause immediate worsening hospital south korea said would continue work even early end medical impasse also dim action come president suggesting possible softening punitive striking junior 12000 medical faced impending refusal end oppose plan increase medical school admission cap saying cant handle steep increase would eventually hurt south medical say urgently south korea rapidly aging population ratio one meeting ruling party leader han medical 40 university junior work training expressed support striking saying recruitment plan would collapse medical system kim head emergency committee said overture positive step said current standoff government wont resolved unless government back recruitment said stick submit voluntarily cut back working 52 per week maximum weekly number legal working say senior grappling excessive left government intention withdrawing plan intention considering ready discus pending government public kim meeting han office flexibly handle issue license striking prime minister pursue flexible measure resolve dispute seek constructive according unclear whether soon government would sit reach breakthrough say likely softening striking pursuit dialogue likely related next parliamentary hospital would unhelpful ruling party striking junior represent le 10 south 140000 major account 3040 senior dealing show majority south support push create say one south korea worry lower due rise number say address shortage rural essential say newly would also try work capital region like plastic surgery dermatology say government plan would also likely result unnecessary due competition south korea senior submit support
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,333,"Japan PM proposed summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea says","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida offered to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “as soon as possible,” but stressed that prospects for their countries’ first summit in about 20 years would depend on Tokyo tolerating its weapons program and ignoring its past abductions of Japanese nationals.
Kishida said later Monday that a meeting with Kim is “crucial” to resolve the abduction issue, a major sticking point in bilateral ties, and that his government has been using various channels to discuss the possible summit.
Observers say Kim wants improved ties with Japan as a way to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its allies, while Kishida wants to use possible progress in the abduction issue to boost his declining approval rating at home. But they say it would be highly unlikely for a Kim-Kishida summit to happen anytime soon because North Korea has set preconditions that Japan can’t accept.
Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said in a statement that Kishida recently used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person “as soon as possible.”
She said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government is engrossed in the abduction issue and interferes in the North’s “exercise of our sovereign right,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
“The history of the DPRK-Japan relations gives a lesson that it is impossible to improve the bilateral relations full of distrust and misunderstanding, only with an idea to set out on a summit meeting,” Kim Yo Jong said, using the abbreviation of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
“If Japan truly wants to improve the bilateral relations and contribute to ensuring regional peace and stability as a close neighbor of the DPRK, it is necessary for it to make a political decision for a strategic option conformed to its overall interests,” she said.
In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement, saying North Korea was open to inviting Kishida to Pyongyang but that it would only be possible if Tokyo stopped taking issue with North Korea’s legitimate right to self-defense and the abduction issue.
North Korea and Japan don’t have diplomatic ties, and their relations have been overshadowed by North Korea’s nuclear program, the abduction issue and Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Japan’s colonial wrongdoing is a source of on-again, off-again wrangling between Tokyo and Seoul, as well.
After years of denial, North Korea acknowledged in an unprecedented 2002 summit between Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, and then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese, mainly to train spies in Japanese language and culture. It allowed five of them to return to Japan that year, but said the others had died. Japan thinks at least some of them may still be alive, and believes hundreds more may also have been abducted.
In 2004, Koizumi made a second visit to North Korea and met Kim Jong Il again. That was the last summit between the leaders of the two countries.
Talk of a possible North Korea-Japan summit comes amid concerns that North Korea could further intensify its weapons testing activities in what is an election year both in the U.S. and South Korea. Experts say North Korea would aim to use an enlarged weapons arsenal to win concessions from the U.S. such as sanctions relief.
“While North Korea may be waiting out elections in South Korea and the United States before reengaging those countries in diplomacy, it probably wants to strengthen its hand by developing weapons and driving wedges between U.S. allies,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “Kishida feels political urgency to address the abductions issue and is thus showing diplomatic effort.”
The impoverished North also likely thinks about possible Japanese economic assistance it could receive if the two countries normalized their ties, said analyst Moon Seong Mook with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. He said North Korea could seek the current value of the Japanese assistance that South Korea received when those two countries normalized their ties in 1965 — $500 million — or more.
Moon said Kishida won’t likely make concessions on the abduction issue or North Korea’s nuclear program in defiance of public sentiments and U.N. resolutions, respectively. Easley said a Kim-Kishida summit is unlikely because Pyongyang appears unwilling to address its historical kidnapping of Japanese citizens and Tokyo is unable to relax sanctions on North Korea.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Monday it was closely communicating with Japan on Tokyo-Pyongyang contacts and the North Korean nuclear issue. It said that South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are working closely together to return North Korea to a path of denuclearization.
North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile arsenals pose a major security threat to Japan as well as South Korea and the United States. The three countries have expanded their trilateral training exercises in response to the North’s provocative run of weapons tests since 2022. Japan and South Korea are two of America’s key allies in the region, together hosting about 80,000 U.S. troops in their territories.
Earlier Monday, North Korea’s state media reported that Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea.
While most analysts doubt Kim is genuinely preparing for war, South Korean officials have raised the possibility of smaller provocations in border regions, including the disputed western sea boundary between the Koreas that has been the site of bloody skirmishes in past years.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,334,North Korean leader Kim visits tank unit and touts war preparations in face of tensions with Seoul,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea, the North’s state media said Monday.
Kim made those comments Sunday while visiting his top tank group, the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division. The unit’s name marks how it was the first North Korean military unit to reach the South Korean capital in 1950 when a North Korean surprise attack triggered a war that dragged on for almost four years.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have heightened after Kim in past months dialed up his military demonstrations, including tests of nuclear-capable missiles designed to target South Korea, the United States and Japan, while issuing threats of nuclear conflict against its rivals.
Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises and updating their deterrence plans built around strategic U.S. assets.
Photos published by North Korean state media showed Kim talking with military officers at an observation post and tanks with North Korean flags rolling through dirt, with at least one of the vehicles carrying a sign that read: “Annihilate U.S. invaders who are staunch enemies of the Korean people!”
The official Korean Central News Agency said Kim praised the 105th Division as a model for his entire army “in the ongoing struggle … for finishing war preparations.” He also issued instructions to improve the unit’s combat preparations and upgrade its equipment, the report said.
Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were closely monitoring North Korean military activities but did not provide a specific assessment of the details reported by North Korean state media.
Kim earlier this month supervised a training competition between his military’s tank units, which was won by the 105th Division. The event on March 13 also featured a new North Korean battle tank meant to underscore Kim’s efforts to strengthen his conventional military capabilities along with his arsenal of missiles.
Last week, North Korea conducted a live-fire drill of large-size multiple rocket launchers designed to target Seoul and also claimed a successful engine test in its efforts to build a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile, which would be aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific, including the military hub of Guam.
There are concerns North Korea could further dial up pressure in what is an election year in both the United States and South Korea.
While most analysts doubt Kim is genuinely preparing for war, South Korean officials have raised the possibility of smaller provocations in border regions, including the disputed western sea boundary between the Koreas that has been the site of bloody skirmishes in past years.
In a fiery speech to Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament in January, Kim declared that he was abandoning North Korea’s long-standing goal of reconciliation with the South and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to cement its war-divided rival as its most hostile adversary.

Japan’s government did not immediately respond to the North Korean announcement. In the statement carried by state media, Mr Kim’s sister and senior official Kim Yo-jong said Mr Kishida used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong-un in person at an early date.

“If Japan continues to try to interfere with our exercise of our sovereign rights, and continues to be preoccupied with the abduction issue, of which there is nothing more to resolve or investigate, then the prime minister’s [offer for talks] will inevitably be labelled as just an attempt to improve his popularity,” she said.
“As long as Japan is hostile toward [North Korea] and infringes our sovereign rights, we will consider it as an enemy that is within our target, not as a friend,” Kim Yo-jong said. “The prime minister should know that he won’t be able to meet the leadership of our country just because he wants to or just because he’s determined to.”",2024-03-25 05:09:12,https://www.afr.com,The Australian Financial Review,335,north korea said prime minister summit north leader kim north korea japan show sincerity toward improving bilateral first summit 20 government immediately respond north announcement statement carried state medium sister senior official kim said used unspecified channel convey position meet kim person early leader kim surrounded visit top tank unit march 24 said breakthrough north long government issue north korea past exercise sovereign apparently testing japan try interfere exercise sovereign preoccupied abduction issue nothing resolve investigate prime offer inevitably attempt improve popularity long japan hostile toward north korea sovereign consider enemy within target friend kim said prime minister know wont able meet leadership country determined north korea summit kim ease

The president of the Medical Professors Association of Korea, Kim Chang-soo, said professors will start scaling back outpatient treatment to focus on emergency and severely ill patients, while others will submit their resignations.
“It is clear that increasing medical school admissions will not only ruin medical school education but cause our country’s healthcare system to collapse,” he said.
Trainee doctors have been on strike since 20 February over a plan to increase the number of students admitted each year to medical school from 2025 to address shortages in rural areas and greater demand on services caused by South Korea’s rapidly ageing population.
But the striking doctors, who make up 93% of the trainee workforce, claim the recruitment of 2,000 additional students a year from 2025 will compromise the quality of services. Critics have said the authorities should focus on improving the pay and working conditions of trainee doctors first.
The industrial action has forced several hospitals to turn back patients and delay procedures.
President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has made healthcare reforms one of his signature policy initiatives, has vowed not to back down on implementing the admissions plan.
South Korea’s government has also threatened to suspend the licences of the doctors who have walked off their jobs, but on Sunday Yoon appeared to seek a more conciliatory approach and urged prime minister Han Duck-soo to seek “flexible measures” in dealing with the suspension.
Yoon’s office said he also ordered the prime minister to form a “constructive consultative body” to speak with all medical professionals.
According to a Gallup poll released on 15 March, 38% said the government was doing a good job in dealing with the backlash from doctors to the plan and the medical void amid the doctors’ strike, while 49% said “not a good job”.",2024-03-25 04:42:02,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian,336,medical south korea said reduce spend practice say plan resign strike move begin support trainee strike month government plan boost medical school president medical association korea kim said start scaling back outpatient treatment focus emergency severely ill submit clear increasing medical school ruin medical school education cause system collapse strike since 20 plan increase number admitted year medical school 2025 address rural greater demand south rapidly striking make 93 trainee claim recruitment 2000 additional year 2025 compromise quality said focus improving pay working trainee industrial action forced several turn back delay made one signature policy vowed back government also suspend seek conciliatory approach prime minister han seek flexible dealing office said also ordered prime minister form constructive consultative body speak medical poll 15 march 38 said government good job dealing backlash plan medical void amid strike 49 said good job south korea strike medical join
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,337,North Korea says Japan's prime minister proposed summit with leader Kim Jong Un,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the North urged Japan to show sincerity toward improving bilateral ties and realizing their co
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has proposed a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the North urged Japan to show sincerity toward improving bilateral ties and realizing their countries' first summit in about 20 years.
Japan’s government did not immediately respond to the North Korean announcement. In the statement carried by state media, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said Kishida used an unspecified channel to convey his position that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un in person at an early date.
Kim Yo Jong said there will be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government raises the issue of Japanese citizens abducted to North Korea in past decades and opposes what she described as the North’s “exercise of sovereign rights,” apparently referring to the North’s weapons testing activities.
“If Japan continues to try to interfere with our exercise of our sovereign rights, and continues to be preoccupied with the abduction issue, of which there is nothing more to resolve or investigate, then the prime minister’s (offer for talks) will inevitably be labeled as just an attempt to improve his popularity,” she said.
“As long as Japan is hostile toward (North Korea) and infringes our sovereign rights, we will consider it as an enemy that is within our target, not as a friend,” Kim Yo Jong said. “The prime minister should know that he won’t be able to meet the leadership of our country just because he wants to or just because he’s determined to.”
In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement on bilateral ties, saying North Korea was open to improving relationships with Japan and even inviting Kishida to Pyongyang. But she said those would be possible only if Tokyo “drops its bad habit of unreasonably pulling up (North Korea) over its legitimate right to self-defense and does not lay such a stumbling block as the already settled abduction issue.”
Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken a trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants better ties with North Korea to increase his declining approval rating at home.
The U.S. and South Korea have been expanding their military drills and trilateral exercises involving Japan in response to North Korea’s provocative run of weapons tests since 2022. The North Korean weapons tested in recent years included nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike key facilities in Japan as well as those in South Korea and the mainland U.S.
North Korea and Japan don't have diplomatic ties, and their relations have been overshadowed by North Korea's nuclear program, the North's past abduction of Japanese nationals and Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
After years of denial, North Korea acknowledged in an unprecedented 2002 summit between Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, and then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese, mainly to train spies in Japanese language and culture. It allowed five of them to return to Japan that year, but said the others had died. Japan thinks at least some of them may still be alive, and believes hundreds more may also have been abducted.
Earlier Monday, North Korea’s state media reported that Kim Jong Un supervised a tank exercise and encouraged his armored forces to sharpen war preparations in the face of growing tensions with South Korea.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,344,"Senior doctors in South Korea to submit resignations, deepening dispute over medical school plan","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Senior doctors at dozens of hospitals in South Korea planned to submit their resignations Monday in support of medical interns and residents who have been on a strike for five weeks over the government’s push to sharply increase medical school admissions, their leader said.

The senior doctors' action won't likely cause an immediate worsening of hospital operations in South Korea because they have said they would continue to work even after submitting their resignations. But prospects for an early end to the medical impasse were also dim, as the doctors' planned action comes after President Yoon Suk Yeol called for talks with doctors while suggesting a possible softening of punitive steps against the striking junior doctors.
Advertisement
About 12,000 interns and medical residents have faced impending suspensions of their licenses over their refusal to end their strikes, which have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals.
Advertisement
They oppose the government's plan to increase the country's medical school admission cap by two-thirds, saying schools can't handle such a steep increase in students and that it would eventually hurt South Korea's medical services. But officials say more doctors are urgently needed because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world.

In a meeting with ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon on Sunday, representatives of medical professors and doctors at some 40 university hospitals — where the junior doctors work while training — expressed support for the striking doctors, saying the government's recruitment plan “would collapse our country's medical system,” Kim Chang-soo, head of the emergency committee at those universities, said Monday.
Kim called Yoon's overture a positive step but said the current standoff between doctors and the government won't be resolved unless the government rolls back its recruitment plan.
Advertisement
He said doctors at the universities were expected to stick to earlier plans to submit resignations voluntarily and cut back their working hours to 52 hours per week — the maximum weekly number of legal working hours. Observers say senior doctors have been grappling with excessive workloads after their juniors left their hospitals.
“If the government has an intention of withdrawing its plan or has an intention of considering it, we're ready to discuss all pending issues with the government before the public,” Kim said.

After Sunday's meeting, Han asked Yoon's office to “flexibly handle” the issue of planned license suspensions for the striking doctors. Yoon then asked his prime minister to pursue “a flexible measure"" to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors, according to Yoon's office.
It's unclear whether and how soon the government and doctors would sit down for talks and reach a breakthrough. Some observers say the government's likely softening of punishments for the striking doctors and its pursuit of dialogue with doctors were likely related to next month’s parliamentary elections as further disruptions of hospital operations would be unhelpful for ruling party candidates.
Advertisement
The striking junior doctors represent less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors, and critics say that doctors, one of the highest-paid professions in South Korea, worry about lower incomes due to a rise in the number of doctors.

Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,350,South Korea's Eunji Gim wins bronze at women's curling championships,"Gregory Strong, The Canadian Press
South Korea's Eunji Gim defeated Italy's Stefania Constantini 6-3 on Sunday to win bronze at the world women's curling championship.
Gim made a double-takeout to score three points in the 10th end to reach the world podium for the first time in five career appearances.
Canada's Rachel Homan was scheduled to play defending champion Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland in the final later in the day at Centre 200.
In the third-place game, neither team could manage a deuce in a quiet first half. Gim had a chance for a pair in the fourth end but settled for a single when her stone rolled out.
The South Korean skip's draw weight returned for the morning game after a poor showing in a semifinal loss to Canada the night before.
Gim drew for two points and a 3-2 lead in the sixth end but missed a chance for a force in the seventh with a rollout. Italy tied the game in the eighth end by playing a safer single rather than a tricky double-takeout.
The teams blanked the ninth and Italy was unable to force Gim to draw with her last throw in the 10th end.
Homan and her Ottawa-based team of Tracy Fleury, Emma Miskew and Sarah Wilkes will try to end Canada's six-year title drought at this event.
The Canadians have won all four head-to-head meetings against Tirinzoni this season but the Swiss skip has won four world titles in a row.
Homan's lone world title came at the 2017 playdowns in Beijing. Canada's Jennifer Jones won gold the following year in North Bay, Ont.
Homan ended Tirinzoni's 42-game win streak at this competition en route to an 11-1 round-robin record. The Canadian's lone defeat — which ended a 27-game overall win streak — was to Gim in a playoff tune-up on Friday with the top seed already secured.
The top-ranked Homan entered the final day with a season record of 61-6 and a 23-8 all-time mark in head-to-head matchups against the second-ranked Tirinzoni.

The Russian delegation arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday and said in a statement that Malyshev had already discussed ""promising areas of cooperation"" regarding arts and culture with North Korean officials.
The Russian Culture Ministry said Malyshev was asked to consider the possibility of sending Russian specialists to teach master classes in North Korea and conduct joint performances with North Korean theater and dance groups.
""Separately, the readiness of Russian creative universities to accept students from [North Korea] was noted,"" the Russian Culture Ministry said, adding that it invited North Korean officials to the International Children's Cultural Forum which will be held in August in Moscow.
And officials discussed organizing future exhibitions of work by North Korean artists in Russia while North Korea plans to host a Russian film festival in North Korea - particularly ""modern patriotic films"" that ""can arouse significant interest"" from viewers in the isolated country.

Meanwhile, North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un sent condolences to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday after a terrorist attack in Moscow killed at least 133 people. The news of the attack came as the Russian delegation was visiting North Korea.
""Having learned of the unexpected and sad news of the large-scale terrorist attack in Moscow Oblast, which resulted in the loss of many lives, I express in the name of the government and people of [North Korea] and myself my deepest condolences and sympathies to you and through you to the government and people of your country, the bereaved families and the victims,"" Kim said.
Kim, in his message to Putin, said that North Korea stands ""against all forms of terrorism"" and that ""nothing can justify the heinous act of terrorism that threatens human life.""
""Our people feel the misfortune and sorrow of the friendly people of Russia, and we extend our firm support and solidarity to your just cause to consolidate the social and political unity and stability centered on you, and to defend the security and sovereign rights of the country,"" Kim said.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,359,Canada's Homan advances to face Switzerland's Tirinzoni for gold at women's curling worlds,"Rachel Homan's season has been noteworthy for win streaks, dominant play and a surge to the top position in world rankings.
A 9-7 semifinal win over South Korea's Gim Eun-ji on Saturday has set her up for a potential high point of an already sterling campaign — and on home ice to boot.
Homan and her Ottawa-based team of Tracy Fleury, Emma Miskew and Sarah Wilkes will play defending champion Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland for gold on Sunday at the women's curling world championship in Sydney, N.S.
""We've had good success against them this year,"" said Canada coach Don Bartlett. ""But this is the game we've been waiting for.""

Canada's Homan to play for gold at women's curling worlds after win over South Korea Duration 1:38 Canada's Rachel Homan beats Gim Eun-ji of South Korea 9-7 in the semifinals at the women's curling world championship. Homan will face defending champion Silvana Tirinzoni of Switzerland in the championship game.
The showdown at Centre 200 will be a matchup of the top two teams in the world. Homan has won all four head-to-head meetings this season but Tirinzoni has won four straight world titles.
""We've trained and we've prepared for this moment,"" Homan said. ""We know that we're ready. We're going to give everything we can.""

Both teams had to outlast tough opponents to book their tickets to the final. South Korea shot a solid 82 per cent as a team but Gim and third Minji Kim struggled with draws.
Hit-and-roll attempts that weren't under full cover also proved costly. Homan made a double-takeout in the 10th end to sit three points and won the game by picking out Gim's draw that overcurled by half a rock.
""We made a lot of great shots in the last end to seal it,"" Miskew said.
The normally staid Homan let loose as she slid down the ice after the game-winning throw. She let out a yell and raised her arms in the air in celebration as the partisan crowd roared in delight.
She'll have a chance to win her first world title since 2017 in Beijing and end Canada's six-year drought at this event.
""She was outstanding all week,"" said South Korea coach Guy Hemmings. ""We just had to hold her one more end. We held her for nine ends but in the last end she got us.""

The teams exchanged singles over the next four ends before Canada picked up a deuce on a Homan draw to the button. Gim was heavy with two straight draws ahead of the Canadian skip's last throw.
In the ninth, Homan rubbed South Korea's stone on the four-foot ring to set up Gim for a soft hit to score two. Canada was pleased to be down one in the 10th end with the all-important hammer.
""They're a phenomenal team,"" Homan said. ""One more mistake and we lose that game.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,377,"Strong possibility Russia will veto resolution on North Korea sanctions, UN diplomat says","There is a strong possibility Russia will veto a United Nations resolution on Friday calling for continuation of the mandate of an expert panel that monitors implementation of U.N. sanctions on North Korea, a U.N. diplomat told Reuters. Such a veto, at a vote expected on Friday afternoon, would mean dissolution of the Panel of Experts monitoring enforcement of long-standing UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It's a strong possibility that Russian vetoes this resolution,"" the diplomat said. ""That's unprecedented - basically it's been technical roll-overs for the last 14 years, I believe."" Russia's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The diplomat said if Russia were to veto, if would be the second time in a day that the permanent member of the Security Council had exercised that power, after Russia, and China, voted against a U.S.-proposed Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as part of a hostage deal. ""I think it would be the first time any country in the last 40 years has vetoed two different resolutions on two different files in the same day,"" the diplomat said.
A text of the resolution seen by Reuters calls for the extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts for another year until April 30, 2025. Another U.N. diplomat said that both Russia and China had sought ""sunset"" clauses to parts of the sanctions regime on North Korea and the text states the Security Council ""is prepared to review, by 30 April 2025, the appropriateness of measures taken to date.""
Such a review would cover possible ""strengthening, modification, suspension, or lifting of the measures as may be needed in light of (North Korea's) compliance,"" it said. The suggestion of a possible Russian veto comes after a closening of relations between North Korea and Russia since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The United States has charged that North Korea has supplied Russia with large quantities of artillery shells as well as ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. Russia and North Korea have denied this even as they pledged to strengthen military cooperation. Last year Russia voted in favor of an extension of the mandate of the Panel of Experts, but expressed regret that the resolution then did not include proposals on the need to minimize the impact of sanctions on the North Korean population and confidentiality issues concerning the panel.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,380,Dutch PM to meet China's Xi as chip export policy strains ties,"The Dutch prime minister will travel to Beijing next week for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on ""economic ties"", the Dutch government said on Friday, a meeting likely to be strained over computer chip export policy matters. The Dutch government this year began denying licences for ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, to export many of its products to China, following pressure from the United States.
ASML dominates the global market for lithography systems, multi-million dollar tools essential in helping to create the circuitry of computer chips. One of Xi's top policy goals has been to help China build up its domestic chipmaking industry, spending billions on subsidies.
Meanwhile the U.S. government is seeking to undermine China's ability to make its own chips, and has enlisted aid from the Dutch and Japanese governments in restricting equipment exports. Under rules in place since Jan. 1, ASML has said it no longer expects to receive licences from the Dutch government to ship its more advanced ""DUV"" tool lines to Chinese customers.
But it remains unclear how much of the equipment ASML has already sold to Chinese customers it will be able to continue to service. It sold gear worth more than 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) to Chinese chipmakers in 2023, making China ASML's second-largest market behind Taiwan and ahead of South Korea.
Without spare parts, ASML's machines are expected to become impossible to operate within weeks. During the March 26-27 visit, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to meet with Xi and premier Li Qiang, while Dutch Trade Minister Geoffrey van Leeuwen is also attending and expected to meet with Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao.
""They will discuss economic cooperation opportunities, the importance of a level playing field, and the importance of equal market access,"" the Dutch government said in a statement. ($1 = 0.9244 euros)

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,381,North Korea-Japan World Cup qualifier off,"North Korea’s home World Cup qualifier against Japan was called off on Friday, the Asian Football Confederation said, hours after announcing it would be moved to a neutral venue.
“The fixture between DPR Korea and Japan, scheduled to be played on March 26, will not take place as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances,” the AFC said in a statement.

It said the decision was taken after talks with world football governing body FIFA and came a day after North Korea said it would not be able to stage the game in the capital Pyongyang.

North Korean officials did not say why.
The AFC said the matter would now be referred to “the relevant committees” in FIFA with further updates expected.
It did not confirm if the fixture would be played at a future time or place.
Earlier Friday, AFC general secretary Windsor John told AFP the game would proceed, but at a neutral venue.
The match in Pyongyang would have been the first game in North Korea for Japan’s men’s team since 2011 and a rare international football match in isolated North Korea.

Japanese news agency Kyodo reported on Thursday that North Korea didn’t want to host the match over fears of bacterial infections in Japan.
North Korean officials the same day told their Japanese counterparts that they could not play host, without saying why.
“They asked us during half-time if we can organize (it) in Japan,” Japan football association chief Kozo Tashima said after the teams met in a first qualifier in Tokyo, which the hosts won 1-0.
“I told them it was so sudden and that I cannot give them an immediate yes,” Japanese media quoted Tashima as saying.
“I told them it will take us at least two or three days (to answer). I told them it’s difficult,” he said.
Earlier this week Japan’s foreign ministry warned football fans not to attempt to travel to the country for the match.
“As you know, North Korea takes a hostile view of Japan and travel is not recommended for the general public,” it said on X, formerly Twitter.
Fourteen government officials had been set to accompany the Japan team for the match as well as a small number of media outlets, broadcaster NHK reported.
Relations have long been dogged by issues including compensation for Japan’s brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and more recently by Pyongyang’s firing of missiles over Japanese territory.
The abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s — forced to train spies in Japanese language and customs — has also long been a major point of contention.
Despite being isolated and poor, North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup.
But they were knocked out at the group stage following three defeats, including a 7-0 thumping by Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,383,North Korea cancels World Cup qualifier against Japan,"North Korea has abruptly cancelled its 2026 World Cup qualifying match with Japan next week, leaving organisers frantically searching for an alternative venue.
North Korea reportedly decided it would no longer host the match, which had been scheduled for next Tuesday at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang, a day before the teams met in Tokyo on Thursday in the first of their two Asian qualifying Group B qualifiers.
Minutes after that game, which Japan won 1-0, Kozo Tashima, the president of the Japan Football Association, told reporters that the return match in the North Korean capital would not go ahead.
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said the match had been called off due to “unforeseen circumstances”.
“The decision, taken in consultation with Fifa and relevant stakeholders, comes after the AFC was informed on 20 March by the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] Football Association of the need to move the match to a neutral venue due to unavoidable circumstances,” it said in a statement on Friday.
The AFC did not give a reason for the cancellation and said it would be left to the relevant Fifa committees to decide on the fixture’s future.
The Nikkei Asia website said the match had been moved to a yet unannounced neutral venue, while no date has been given for the fixture.
The Kyodo news agency cited unspecified North Korean media reports about a “malignant infectious disease” in Japan, thought to be a reference to a potentially deadly form of group A streptococcal disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS).
Experts in Japan have said cases of STSS will continue to spread, while officials are struggling to identify the cause. The number of cases in 2024 is expected to exceed last year’s record number after the presence of highly virulent and infectious strains were confirmed in Japan.
Japan’s players and staff had planned to arrive in Pyongyang on Monday after training in Beijing, media reports said.
Last month, a qualifying match for the Paris Olympics between the Japanese and North Korean women’s teams was moved from Pyongyang to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at the last minute after Japanese football authorities cited difficulties in travelling to North Korea, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Japan.
The return leg of the men’s World Cup qualifier would have been the first international sports event to be held in North Korea since before the coronavirus pandemic. The regime responded to the outbreak by sealing its borders and banning foreign tourists.
North Korea last hosted a men’s soccer international in Pyongyang in 2019 during the qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup. The country later pulled out of that competition, citing health concerns related to the pandemic.

Wataru Endo is set to make an early return to Liverpool from international duty after Japan’s upcoming World Cup qualifier was postponed.
The Blue Samurai were due to take on North Korea on Tuesday 26 March, but the game has been postponed due to ‘unforeseen circumstances’.
North Korea had requested for the match to be moved to a neutral venue due to ‘unavoidable circumstances’, prompting the Asian Football Confederation to confirm the match had been postponed.

SEOUL, March 22 (UPI) -- North Korea canceled plans to host a scheduled World Cup qualifying match against Japan next week, Asia's governing soccer association confirmed Friday, leaving organizers scrambling to find a neutral venue with just days to spare. The two sides played the first leg of back-to-back qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup on Thursday in Tokyo, which Japan won 1-0. However, North Korean officials abruptly notified their Japanese counterparts and the Asian Football Confederation that they were not going to host the follow-up in Pyongyang, which had been scheduled for Tuesday.

Japan Football Association President Kozo Tashima told local media Thursday that he had received a message from North Korean officials earlier that day saying they were withdrawing because it would be ""difficult"" to host the contest in Pyongyang.
Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that North Korea is believed to have pulled out due to the outbreak of a lethal streptococcus infection in Japan, citing an article Thursday in the North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper on a ""malignant infectious disease"" in the country.
In a separate article on the same day, the newspaper also reported on a ""highly contagious measles outbreak"" in Japan.
North Korea sealed its borders at the very outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020 and only slowly began allowing cross-border traffic with China to resume in August 2023.
The Pyongyang match would have been the first international soccer contest held in North Korea since 2019, when it hosted a qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup.
Last week, Japan's Foreign Ministry said it would send 14 officials to support the team and Japanese media members in North Korea, as the countries do not have diplomatic relations. However, the ministry advised fans to refrain from traveling to Pyongyang for the match.

North Korea is still scheduled to hold home qualifiers against Syria and Myanmar in June.
The cancellation comes after an Olympic soccer qualifier between the Japanese and North Korean women's teams was also relocated from Pyongyang last month.
The Japan Football Association requested the move to a neutral venue, citing a lack of flights for its fans and delays in working with the North Korean hosts. The match was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,386,"Who is Ippei Mizuhara, Shohei Ohtani's interpreter?","SEOUL, South Korea — Japanese interpreter Ippei Mizuhara has been fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after allegations he stole money from baseball star Shohei Ohtani to service illegal gambling debts. He and his alleged bookmaker are also under investigation by the IRS.
But who is Mizuhara and how did he get in a position to carry out the alleged theft from his close friend?
ADVERTISEMENT
The 39-year-old Mizuhara is a familiar face to baseball fans as Ohtani’s companion, having interpreted for the star with mainly media since Ohtani moved to the United States in 2017.
READ: Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter fired after allegations of ‘massive theft’
Mizuhara even served as Ohtani’s catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. When Ohtani left the Los Angeles Angels for a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in December, the club also hired Mizuhara.
Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to the Los Angeles area in 1991 so his father could work as a chef. He attended Diamond Bar High School in eastern Los Angeles County and graduated from the University of California, Riverside, in 2007.
After college, Mizuhara was hired by the Boston Red Sox as an interpreter for Japanese pitcher Hideki Okajima. He returned to Japan in 2013 to translate for English-speaking players on the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. That’s where he first met Ohtani, who joined the team that same year.

After Ohtani signed with the Angels in 2017, the team hired Mizuhara to work as his personal interpreter, and he followed the player when he joined the Dodgers.

Mizuhara was in the Dodgers’ dugout on Wednesday during its season-opening win over San Diego in Seoul.
Ohtani made his Dodgers debut in the game but it has been overshadowed by reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about Mizuhara’s alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker.
Law firm Berk Brettler LLP followed up Wednesday by saying, “Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft.”
Sports gambling is illegal in California, even as 38 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of it.
Mizuhara told ESPN on Tuesday night he gambled on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football, but said he never bet on baseball, which is prohibited among team employees under MLB rules.
Mizuhara said he incurred more than $1 million in debt by the end of 2022 and his losses increased from there. He told ESPN that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at his request.
But Ohtani’s attorneys then released a statement saying the player was a victim of theft, and ESPN says Mizuhara changed his story Wednesday to say Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.
The Associated Press was unable reach Mizuhara for comment. It was not clear if he had hired an attorney.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,388,Top South Korean university to penalise school bullies in admission exams,"Students with a history of bullying will be penalised during entrance exams at the prestigious Korea University from 2025, in a bid to clamp down on the rise in school bullying in South Korea.
The university’s president Kim Dong-won said on March 21 that such students will face a deduction of up to 20 points in the entrance exam, Seoul Economic Daily reported.
The school’s academic affairs committee will deduct a maximum of 20 points from the scores of applicants who were expelled or had a forced transfer due to bullying, Yonhap News Agency said.
The university is one of South Korea’s top three prestigious schools, which also include Seoul National University and Yonsei University.
Speaking at a press conference, Mr Kim said that applicants who have been disciplined for school violence do not match the university’s ideals of “altruism, leadership and community”.
“Currently, even a 0.1-point difference can affect the outcome (of an admission), so a deduction of 20 points would practically make admission impossible,” he said.
The percentage of Seoul students who said they had been targeted by a bully – or iljin in Korean – hit a high in the past 10 years, according to a 2023 Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education (Smoe) study.
The survey of 486,729 students, between the fourth grade of elementary school and the final year of high school, found that 2.2 per cent had experienced some form of mistreatment at school. The figure increased by 2 per cent compared with 2022, and marked a 10-year high.
Verbal abuse was the most common form of school violence, followed by physical abuse and bullying.
Smoe attributed the rise in cases to students’ return to in-person classes after years of online classes during the Covid-19 pandemic.
An official said students had fewer chances to interact with their friends during the pandemic and Smoe believed this led to the higher tendency of violence towards students having more difficulty addressing conflicts.
To combat the growing cases, measures like having students’ bullying records reflected in the college admissions process from the 2026 academic year were rolled out in 2023.
The South Korean government has also considered extending the bullying record retention period so that the black mark will follow the perpetrators when they apply for jobs.
In recent years, some celebrities have also been embroiled in bullying scandals.
For example, in 2021, actor Ji Soo was dropped from an ongoing drama after admitting to being a bully and “sex predator” in school.
That same year, K-pop singer Garam had to leave the five-member girl group Le Sserafim after being accused of bullying in middle school.
Volleyball stars Lee Jae-yeong and Lee Da-yeong were also banned by the national team in 2021 after it was confirmed that the twin sisters had bullied their teammates in middle school.
The school bullying phenomenon has been turned into the hit Netflix drama series The Glory, which tells the story of a woman who plans to seek revenge on her high school bullies after 17 years.
The series’ director Ahn Gil-ho was later accused of bullying and admitted to having physically assaulted younger students when he was in high school.",2024-03-22 05:40:00,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times,388,history bullying entrance prestigious korea university 2025 bid clamp rise school bullying south president kim said march 21 face deduction 20 entrance exam economic daily academic committee deduct maximum 20 forced transfer due bullying news agency university one south top three prestigious also include national university press conference kim said school violence match altruism leadership even 01point difference affect outcome admission deduction 20 would practically make admission impossible percentage said targeted bully hit high past 10 according 2023 metropolitan office education survey 486729 fourth grade elementary school final year high school found 22 per cent experienced form mistreatment school figure 2 per cent 2022 marked 10year abuse common form school violence physical abuse rise return class class covid19 official said interact pandemic led higher tendency violence towards difficulty combat growing like bullying reflected college process 2026 academic year rolled 2023the south government also considered extending bullying record retention period black mark follow apply recent also bullying example 2021 actor ongoing drama bully sex predator year singer leave girl group accused bullying middle lee lee also national team 2021 confirmed twin middle school bullying phenomenon turned hit drama series glory story woman seek revenge high school 17 series director later accused bullying admitted physically younger high school top south university school admission
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,390,1MILLION Dance Studio brings K-dance moves to MFA Late Nites,"The group, which boasts more than 26 million subscribers on YouTube , brought members Debby, Lia Kim, Harimu, Amy, and Dohee to Boston this week for the launch of “Hallyu! The Korean Wave,” a new exhibit on Korean art, history, and pop culture that opens to the public at the Museum of Fine Arts on Sunday. 1MILLION Dance Studio was tapped to perform at Friday night’s MFA Late Nites celebration, which is expected to attract thousands of visitors eager for an early look at the exhibit. Presented by CJ ENM, the festivities will also include performances by fellow Seoul-based acts Ailee and HYPNOSIS THERAPY.
Korean pop culture has become a powerful force on the global stage. K-pop stars like BTS and Blackpink have sold out arenas around the world, while Korean films and TV shows like “Parasite” and “Squid Game” have become Hollywood award-season darlings. And now, 1MILLION Dance Studio, Korea’s leading dance agency, wants to take K-dance to the same heights.

Starting out in a basement in 2014, 1MILLION Dance Studio has evolved into Korea’s top agency for dancers and choreographers. The group earned global acclaim after participating in the South Korean dance competition “Street Woman Fighter2″ in 2023, and have amassed a huge social media following thanks to their dance videos and constantly updated content stream.
1MILLION cofounder Lia Kim believes that the rapid embrace of Korean culture in recent years is due to a few factors, most notably social media’s role in connecting Korean artists with global audiences. She also noted how Korean society tends to be receptive of new cultures and styles, while maintaining deep traditional roots, enabling them to put their own spin on what’s trending.
“Koreans are very sensitive to trends,” she told the Globe through an interpreter following the group’s tour of the MFA exhibit on Thursday. “They accept new trends really fast and then digest it and interpret it in a new way.”

The group’s growing fan base has attracted visitors from across the world to their studio in Seoul, with budding dancers hoping to learn from the social media stars.
“There are a lot of people from different nationalities [that] come to see 1MILLION,” group member Dohee said. “1MILLION Studio is itself an attraction now.”
When it comes to the exhibit, 1MILLION’s Harimu was particularly drawn to its interactive dance challenge display, where visitors can boogie down and have their moves displayed on a big screen, comparing it to their dance classes.
1MILLION’s Amy appreciated how the exhibit explores the history of Korea and its impact on pop culture, including Gangnam style (yes, the song, but also the cultural region in Seoul), which felt both “refreshing” and “very familiar” to see.
Looking toward the future, Lia Kim said 1MILLION Dance Studio plans to expand with studios, camps, and workshops outside of Korea. She notes that, just like the K-pop stars who became global phenomenons, she wants to see K-dancers find the same success and “have more influence overseas, as well.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,391,Why are striking doctors in South Korea facing license suspensions and what's next?,"South Korea is poised to start suspending the licenses of thousands of striking junior doctors as a punitive measure against their weekslong walkouts that have shaken hospital operations.
Starting next week, the government said it will inform the striking medical interns and residents of its final decision to suspend their licenses for missing a government-imposed February 29 deadline to return to work.
It's still unclear whether the move will prompt the doctors to end their strikes, and the standoff could still deepen as some senior doctors plan to submit resignations on Monday in a show of solidarity with the junior strikers.
Here are the latest developments on the strikes touched off by the government's announcement in early February that it would recruit 2,000 more medical students yearly.
WHY ARE THEIR LICENSES BEING SUSPENDED? Since early March, the South Korean government has been taking a series of administrative steps to suspend the licenses of about 12,000 junior doctors. The steps include informing the strikers about possible suspensions and giving them opportunities to respond.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo said on Tuesday the government is expected to finish those administrative steps for some of the strikers next week and that it will send them final government notices about their impending license suspensions.
Each notice would contain details including when a license suspension will take effect and how long it will last. By law, they must be delivered in person or by mail. But for those whose addresses are unknown, the suspensions would take effect after related information is posted on the government website, according to the Health Ministry.
Health officials have said each striking doctor could face a minimum three-month license suspension and possible indictment by prosecutors. The country's medical law allows punishments of medical personnel if they refuse government orders to resume work.
Park repeated his appeal for doctors to report back to work, suggesting those who return would face unspecified softer punishments. He previously warned that junior doctors with suspension records could face delays in getting licenses for specialists or trouble in finding jobs.
WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS FOR WALKOUTS? Despite the suspensions, striking doctors won't likely back down anytime soon as they have already ignored repeated warnings they must return to work or face prosecution.
Some observers have questioned whether the government could suspend all the striking doctors, who represent more than 90 per cent of the country's 13,000 interns and resident doctors. They said the government would likely target strike leaders and that they would likely respond with legal action.
Further complicating the situation, senior doctors at major university hospitals — where most of the striking doctors trained — are threatening to submit resignations en masse early next week. They plan to continue their work for the time being, but if they walk off the job like the junior doctors, that would cause a much bigger strain on South Korea's medical services, observers say.
The government urged senior doctors to cancel those plans. It recently sent notices to two senior doctors who lead an emergency committee for the walkouts, telling them their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors' strikes.
One of the two doctors, Park Myung-Ha, accused the government of attempting to break up the emergency committee and sending a warning message to the striking junior doctors.
The government on Wednesday announced detailed plans for how to allocate the additional 2,000 admission seats to medical schools, indicating that the government has no intention of revising its plans. The doctors' emergency committee said in a statement Thursday that the striking doctors ""can't repress our astonishment and anger"".
WHAT IS AT THE CENTER OF THE DISPUTE? At the heart of the confrontation is a government plan to increase the country's medical school enrolment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058, which has been unchanged since 2006.
The government says it needs to add up to 10,000 doctors by 2035 because the country has one of the world's fastest-aging populations and its doctors-to-population ratio is among the lowest among advanced economies. Officials say more doctors are needed to address a long-running shortage of physicians in low-paying but key essential professions like pediatrics and emergency departments.
But doctors say universities can't offer quality education to such an abruptly increased number of students and that it would ultimately hurt the quality of South Korea's medical services. They say doctors in greater competition would likely engage in overtreatment and that newly recruited students would also likely want to work in high-paying, popular professions like plastic surgery and dermatology.
The doctors' protests haven't generated public support, with a recent survey showing that about 90 per cent of respondents support an increase in the medical school admission cap. Some critics say the striking doctors worry that adding more doctors would result in lower incomes in the future.
The striking doctors account for less than 10 per cent of the country's 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent 30-40 per cent of the total doctors and assist senior doctors and deal with inpatients. Their walkouts have subsequently led to hundreds of cancelled or postponed surgeries and other treatments.

North Korea, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Tokyo, appears to have decided not to stage the match in its capital over worries about infectious diseases in Japan, Kyodo said. It has not been decided whether the match will be held on the scheduled date or where it will take place, according to Kyodo.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the government was not in a position to comment as FIFA and AFC would make the decision. There was no immediate response to a request for clarification from the AFC. JFA was not immediately available for comment either.
The Samurai Blue squad has cancelled a flight to Beijing originally scheduled for Friday morning and plan to train in Chiba prefecture, the JFA said. North Korea last hosted a men's soccer international in Pyongyang in 2019 during the qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup. The country pulled out of that competition citing health concerns related to the COVID pandemic.
The North Koreans are also scheduled to stage home qualifiers against Syria and Myanmar in June. In February, an Olympic qualifier between the women's teams of the two countries scheduled for Pyongyang was switched at the last minute to a neutral venue in Saudi Arabia.
There was similar confusion over that match, with the Japan team departing for Jeddah four days before the scheduled kickoff without any confirmation of where the match would be played.

LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A pair of dogs rescued from the South Korea meat trade have arrived in Los Angeles.
One of the adorable pups, Danny, is not only a rare breed who was rescued from a kill shelter but also managed to escape a fire at the rescue center that killed 20 other dogs.
According to the organization that flew him to Los Angeles: ""Danny is one of only 600 Donggyeong dogs in the world. The endangered breed has a natural bob tail and is considered a national treasure in South Korea. Rescuers pulled Danny from the same shelter before he could be killed for lack of space or taken by a dog meat buyer. Soon after, Danny managed to escape the Jindo Love Rescue center as it burned down, killing 20 dogs.""
Danny and Yoshi, a shiba inu, met their new adoptive parents at Los Angeles International Airport.
""I would say to people, if you have the means, if you have the want, if you have space in your heart, open your home, open your life, adopt a dog,"" said Deidra Cooper, who adopted Yoshi.
Earlier this year, South Korea's parliament passed a law banning the sale and distribution of dog meat.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,394,"Japan Beats North Korea In World Cup Qualifying Then North Korea Cancels Visit By Japan, Media Says","TOKYO: North Korea reportedly canceled hosting Japan in a World Cup qualifier just hours after losing to Japan in Tokyo on Thursday.
Japan scored after just 90 seconds and held out North Korea to win 1-0 and maintain its perfect start in the second round of Asian qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.
Soon after, Japan Football Association chief Kozo Tashima told Kyodo News that North Korea canceled the scheduled qualifier against Japan on Tuesday in Pyongyang, giving the news in a letter to the Asian Football Confederation.
North Korea was concerned by “a malignant infectious disease” in Japan, an apparent reference to rising cases of streptococcus infections, Kyodo said.
Ao Tanaka’s strike at the National Stadium gave host Japan three wins from three Group B games.
The midfielder fired home from inside a crowded penalty area after a Ritsu Doan pullback.
North Korea, cheered on by a small pocket of red-shirted fans, lacked attacking power to get back in the game. North Korea has only three points from the first three group games.
“We wanted to give our fans a good result and we are sorry we could not but it was a good game,” North Korea coach Sin Yong Nam said.
South Korea was held by Thailand to 1-1 in Seoul in its first game since Jurgen Klinsmann was fired as the coach in February.
Son Heung-min put South Korea ahead after 42 minutes with a shot from close range. Just after an hour, Suphanat Mueanta leveled.
“There’s no getting around the fact that it was a disappointing result but there were positives to take from the game,” Son said.
Despite the draw, South Korea remained on top of Group C ahead of Tuesday’s game in Bangkok, three points above Thailand and China, which drew 2-2 with Singapore.
Australia has won all three of its Group I games after defeating Lebanon 2-0 in Sydney.
Keanu Baccus opened the scoring after just five minutes and Kye Rowles added the second shortly after the restart.
Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all maintained their perfect records with respective wins over the Philippines, Tajikistan and Yemen.
In Jordan’s first action since losing the Asian Cup final to Qatar in February, it beat Pakistan 3-0. Qatar defeated Kuwait by the same scoreline.
The top two teams from each of the nine groups will advance to the final round. Asia’s automatic allocation at the World Cup has increased from four to eight.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,396,"In Japan, Ohtani's 'perfect person' image could take a hit with firing of interpreter over gambling","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is referred to in Japan as “kanpeki no hito” — the perfect person — because of his manners and impeccable behavior.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is referred to in Japan as “kanpeki no hito” — the perfect person — because of his manners and impeccable behavior.
That image may have taken a hit when the Dodgers fired his good friend and interpreter Ippei Mizuhara on Wednesday over allegations he gambled illegally and stole Ohtani’s money to pay off debts.
The law firm representing Ohtani called it a “massive theft” in a statement.
The Seoul Series — the first MLB games in South Korea — were supposed to be a showcase for Ohtani before a fertile baseball audience in Asia. The games between San Diego and Los Angeles were scheduled before he signed a $700 million, 10-year deal with the Dodgers in December. For MLB, the stars seemed perfectly aligned and there is already talk of a similar series next year in Tokyo.
A bomb threat Wednesday briefly put a cloud over the series. Police were warned before the first game of a bomb at the stadium but found no explosives. Ohtani was reportedly the target.
Then came the other Ohtani bombshell.
“I was shocked when I read it,” said Jorge Kuri, a hardcore Dodgers fan from Tijuana, Mexico, who runs a garment business there.
Wearing a blue Dodgers sweatshirt and cap at the Gocheok Sky Dome, Kuri said he was trying to sift through the information that’s out there. He said he’d just returned from vacation in Japan “where Ohtani is king.”
“I don’t know what the end is going to be with this because I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg,” he added. ""Right now he's the image of Major League Baseball.”
Mizuhara, 39, was let go from the team following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker. He was in the dugout and with the team through Wednesday's game — the shocking reports dropped Wednesday evening in the U.S., while most fans in Asia were asleep.
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts confirmed Mizuhara had a meeting with the team Wednesday but declined to elaborate. He said he did not know Mizuhara’s whereabouts and said a different interpreter would be used.
“Anything with that meeting, I can’t comment,” Roberts said, adding that “Shohei’s ready. I know that he’s preparing.”
Ohtani didn’t practice on the field before Thursday's game. In his absence, his face appeared on the video board promoting a line of Japanese cosmetics.
He seemed unfazed hours later in his first at-bat as he lined a single to right field. In two other at-bats he hit towering drives to right just a few feet short of a home run.
Mizuhara is likely to be investigated by U.S. authorities and MLB, and the whole story is a stunning turn for the man who has been inseparable from Ohtani since the two-way star came to the U.S in 2017. He told ESPN this week that Ohtani knew nothing of his illegal wagers on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.
As Mizuhara told it, Ohtani was an innocent victim to his close friend's gambling addiction.
As long as Ohtani isn’t directly accused of illegal betting, the allegations won’t meaningfully hurt his carefully crafted public image, said Lee Seung-yun, a marketing professor at Seoul’s Konkuk University.
“Ohtani’s image is like clean, white porcelain, and that could make a speck look bigger than it is,” he said. “Information spreads at amazing speeds these days, narratives are made before the truth of the facts are figured out, and if Ohtani was seen as a questionable character, the allegations would have really hurt him.""
“But his image is so strong and impeccable, and as long as he wasn’t directly involved, the allegations may just end up a blip,” Lee added.
Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Seoul’s Hanyang University, said Ohtani’s image to global fans, including South Koreans, was that of a mysterious monk who “fully devoted himself into a religion called baseball.”
He said the allegations facing Mizuhara so far only may only strengthen that impression of Ohtani — a person who’s driven by perfection in baseball but more naïve and simple-hearted with other things.
“It’s a problem you often see with athletes — putting too much trust and depending excessively on the people they have known for long and are comfortable with and not knowing when they are taken advantage of,” Lee Jong-Sung said.
“It’s not all about you being perfect. Ohtani and the Dodgers should have better judgment in picking the people he works with,"" he added.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,408,Padres top Dodgers in 15-11 slugfest for split in Korea,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — After chasing Yoshinobu Yamamoto from his major league debut after one inning and scoring their most runs ever against the Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego's Xander Bogaerts was sad to leave the Gocheok Sky Dome.
""We got to come here more,"" he said
Jake Cronenworth tied a career high with four hits and had four RBIs as the Padres outlasted the Dodgers 15-11 on Thursday night after Los Angeles fired Shohei Ohtani's interpreter following allegations of illegal gambling.
Interpreter Ippei Mizuhara was let go from the team Wednesday following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker.
Ohtani hit three deep flyouts on a 1-for-5 night, including a sacrifice fly, and was 3 for 10 with two RBIs in the series. He did not speak with reporters.
""I hope Sho is good, but you know, at the end of the day we have to make sure we take care of our jobs,"" said Mookie Betts, who had six RBIs along with four hits that included the first home run of the major league season. ""No matter what cards we're dealt, we better go play them.""
Yamamoto and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts insisted Mizuhara's situation didn't contribute to the defeat.
""I feel regret that I just couldn't keep the team in the game from the get-go, so I do feel the responsibility for it,"" Yamamoto said through a translator. ""I just got to get ready for the next outing.""
San Diego gained a split in the opening two-games series, Major League Baseball's first games in South Korea. After the Dodgers rebounded from a 9-2 deficit and closed to 12-11, Manny Machado hit a three-run homer in the ninth off J.P. Feyereisen.
San Diego outhit the Dodgers 17-16, and Los Angeles made three errors that led to a pair of unearned runs. Luis Campusano had three hits and 20-year-old center fielder Jackson Merrill got his first two major league hits.
Yamamoto (0-1) signed a $325 million, 12-year contract, a record amount for a pitcher that created high expectations. San Diego batted around against the two-time Pacific League MVP, and he left with a 45.00 ERA, allowing five runs, four hits, one walk, a hit batter and a wild pitch. Cronenworth's two-run triple, Ha-Seong Kim's sacrifice fly, Campusano's RBI double and Tyler Wade's run-scoring single built a 5-1 lead.
""Just didn't have the command and so it's not about the stuff,"" Roberts said. ""When you're a command guy, which he's been his entire career, his life, and you just misfire, get behind in counts, hit batters, that's just not who he is. ... He's an easy guy that you know he'll bounce back from this.""
Bogaerts hit a two-run single in a four-run third off Michael Grove.
Michael King (1-0) won in his Padres debut following his acquisition in the trade that sent Juan Soto to the New York Yankees. King allowed three runs in 3 1/3 innings.
Robert Suarez got four outs for the save after 26-year-old right-hander Stephen Kolek made his major league debut, getting charged with two runs in the eighth.
Padres starter Joe Musgrove gave up five runs, seven hits and two walks in 2 2/3 innings.
Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy allowed Campusano's first-inning bouncer to get under his glove and down the line for an RBI double, had Fernando Tatis Jr.'s third-inning grounder kick off his glove into left for an error as a run scored, then allowed José Azocar's seventh-inning grounder to bounce off his glove for a run-scoring error. Muncy hit an inning-ending popup that stranded two runners in the eighth.
In the second season of the pitch clock, the game took 3 hours, 42 minutes, a day after the opener lasted 3:05. Bogaerts struck out for the final out in the eighth when a pitch clock-violation was called by plate umpire Andy Fletcher with a 1-2 count.
Mike Schildt got his first win as Padres manager.
""A lot of courage, a lot of toughness, a lot of fight,"" he said. ""A really big identity game for our group.""
TRAINER'S ROOM
Bogaerts jammed the ring finger of his left hand while sliding into second base when tagging up in the seventh.
UP NEXT
Dodgers: They host the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday and Monday, then play at Anaheim on Tuesday in the annual exhibition Freeway Series. They resume the season March 28 in their home opener against St. Louis.
Padres: They are home against Seattle in exhibitions at Petco Park on Monday and Tuesday, then resume the season hosting San Francisco in a four-game series starting March 28.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,409,"What we learned from Dodgers vs. Padres in Korea: Bad debut for MLB's top-paid pitcher, sloppy defense, more","The San Diego Padres defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 15-11 on Thursday morning (box score), splitting Major League Baseball's season-opening two-game series in Seoul, South Korea. In between the games, an off-the-field scandal took over the headlines when Shohei Ohtani's interpreter was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the Dodgers superstar to pay gambling debts.
The Padres and Dodgers will now return stateside and resume their seasons on Opening Day (March 28) with 1-1 records.
Since both games started in the early morning on the east coast, we here at CBS Sports felt it would be helpful to our audience to provide a handful of takeaways from the Seoul Series.
Below, then, you'll find five talking points to catch you up on matters.
1. Yamamoto struggles in MLB debut
It's fair to write that Thursday's outing is not what the Dodgers had in mind when they signed right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto to a 12-year pact worth $325 million.
Yamamoto, who authored a brilliant career in Japan, uncharacteristically suffered through command woes on Thursday morning. In turn, he allowed five runs on four hits, a walk, and a hit batsman. (He struck out a pair of batters as well.) According to the research of Eric Stephen of SB Nation, Yamamoto's five runs surrendered in an inning of work represented the most by a debuting Dodgers starter in club history.
There's no sense making too much of Thursday's outing, especially since the most likely explanation -- besides it being a single game -- is that Yamamoto is still in the process of adjusting to the differences between MLB and Nippon Professional Baseball. Those include the pitch clock, a clustered schedule, and a different ball -- one that provides a worse natural grip, if pitchers who have used both are to be trusted.
In other words, it's worth giving Yamamoto more time to adapt.
2. Ohtani appears unbothered by controversy
You may have heard by now that Shohei Ohtani's long-time interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired following Wednesday's game amid theft and illegal gambling allegations. Mizuhara was replaced on Thursday by Will Ireton, formerly Kenta Maeda's interpreter during his time in Los Angeles, according to Fabian Ardaya of The Athletic.
Despite that change, and despite the at-times head-swirling nature of the 24-hour news cycle, Ohtani showed no signs of being distracted on Thursday.
Rather, Ohtani went 1 for 5 with an RBI and nearly delivered both his first home run of the season and his first home run as a member of the Dodgers organization. Alas, the ball fell short of the bleachers, leaving Ohtani to collect a sacrifice fly for his troubles.
3. Merrill records first knocks
Yamamoto wasn't the only player to make his first MLB appearance during this series. Jackson Merrill, a converted infielder now starting in center for the Padres, also checked off some firsts in Seoul. On Thursday, he notched both his first career MLB hit and his first career MLB extra-base hit. Here's the latter:
Merrill was ranked by CBS Sports this spring as the 12th-best prospect in the minors. Here's part of our writeup: ""Merrill connected on more than 80% of his swings last season, resulting in a cumulative .277/.326/.444 slash line across High- and Double-A. His ability to put the bat on the ball is his top selling point. He does have some power, but it's almost exclusively to his pull side.""
4. Betts delivers season's first home run
Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts launched the first home run of the season in the fifth inning when he took advantage of a 3-1 fastball from Padres righty Michael King. Betts' home run reduced the Padres' lead to two. Furthermore, it guarantees that he'll be able to reduce something else -- his share of emissions -- since he won an electric car from Hyundai as part of the South Korean automobile manufacturer's promotional stunt.
Here's a look at that sweet, sweet car-winning home run:
Betts has established new career highs in home runs in each of the past two seasons, including 39 in 2023. We'll see if he can complete the hat trick this year.
5. Gloves did not make trip
There are valid reasons for both teams playing sloppy defense during this two-game set, so we're not here to judge when we write that it wasn't the most crisp series with the leather. The Padres were charged with a pair of errors on Wednesday, and the Dodgers returned volley by committing several of their own on Thursday, with third baseman Max Muncy having a particularly rough go of things.
Of course, the defensive play that everyone will remember from this series occurred on Wednesday, when Padres first baseman Jake Cronenworth had a ball shoot through his glove:

FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,410,Breakaway parties threaten to disrupt South Korea’s two-party system - can they also end parliamentary gridlock?,"Contemporary South Korean politics has traditionally been dominated by just two main parties – in common with many other countries with strong presidential systems. But that could soon change.
Recent voter discontent is creating opportunities for smaller political parties in the upcoming parliamentary election on April 10, 2024.
Heading into that vote, the two main parties – President Yoon Suk Yeol’s People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party – between them hold 270 seats in the 300-member parliament. But both parties are grappling with internal struggles and political controversies that are fueling the prospect of new, breakaway parties making gains.
The result could be a multi-party legislature. As a political scientist with a focus on East Asia and international affairs, I believe that outcome has the potential of transforming the country’s domestic and international agenda.
Parliamentary gridlock
Polling suggests that South Koreans haven’t been happy with the performance of their politicians for years, with one 2022 survey putting trust in the national assembly at just 24%. Events since then are unlikely to have improved confidence in either main party.
Since Yoon being elected president in 2022, his legislative agenda has been met with resistance by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. His plans for reforming the country’s education, pension and labor systems have stalled as a result.
Meanwhile, Yoon has vetoed multiple bills passed by the National Assembly, such as the “yellow envelope” law, which limits companies’ lawsuits for damage claims over labor union disputes, and legislation calling for special probes into the crowd crush inside Seoul’s Itaewon district during Halloween weekend in 2022 that resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries.
On foreign policy, the opposition Democratic Party has faulted the Yoon government’s pursuit of increased security ties with Japan in the face of continued bilateral tensions over Japan’s past colonial history in Korea.
Specifically, the opposition criticized a bilateral deal on compensation for the victims of forced wartime labor in Korea, and the Yoon government’s acceptance of Japan’s release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean.
Last fall, partly as protest against the president’s foreign policy and in a bid to overhaul the government’s cabinet, the National Assembly passed a nonbinding no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, though Yoon refused to dismiss his premier.
The net result of the political gridlock is that both the Yoon government and the Democratic Party face high levels of public disapproval. Yoon’s approval rating has stagnated below 40%, and the majority of voters have expressed an intention to hold his government accountable in the upcoming election by supporting opposition parties.
However, the Democratic Party has failed to capitalize on Yoon’s unpopularity, due to similar public disapproval toward the party’s leader, Lee Jae-myung.
Intraparty factions
South Korea’s two main parties have frequently experienced internal feuds among factions supportive and opposed to party leadership. In recent months, such factions opposed to both Yoon and Lee’s leadership have bolted from their respective parties.
In January 2024, Lee Jun-Seok, former People Power Party chairman, started the New Reform Party with party members who protested the pro-Yoon faction’s seemingly cliquish party leadership. This “non-Yoon” faction has also criticized the president’s veto of the special counsel bill to investigate allegations surrounding first lady Kim Geon-hee, which includes claims of violating anti-graft laws and involvement in stock price manipulation.
The Democratic Party is facing a similar challenge. Also in January 2024, Lee Nak-yon, former prime minister under the previous Democratic government of President Moon Jae-in, started the New Future Party, criticizing his former party as having turned into a “bulletproof shield” for the unpopular leader Lee Jae-myung. Specifically, the “non Jae-myung” faction have criticized him for refusing to step down despite being under criminal investigation on corruption charges.
Opportunities for breakaway parties
These new breakaway parties’ strategy is to take advantage of South Korea’s mixed-member proportional election system, which provides opportunities for smaller parties to win seats. To do so, they have been focusing efforts on building concentrated support among core groups of voters.
The New Reform Party has gained support among younger conservative male voters critical of the older generation of conservative politicians close to Yoon.
Meanwhile, the New Future Party retains some support among traditional Democratic Party members, who feel disappointed with the direction of the party. Several Democratic legislators who claimed to have been purged by the party leadership have joined Lee Nak-yon, widening the schism within the main opposition party.
Potential impact
The latest polls indicate a tight race between the People Power Party and the Democratic Party, with a 37.7% and 36.9% share of the vote, respectively. If the breakaway parties win even a small number of seats, the result could be a “hung parliament,” in which neither main party can form a single-party majority.
That would leave smaller parties with huge legislative leverage.
The New Reform Party is more likely to partner with the Yoon government on policy agendas – despite personal antipathy between Yoon and Lee Jun-Seok. On foreign policy, New Reform Party members have expressed support for pragmatic relations with Japan and have warned against excessive anti-Japan nationalist rhetoric in domestic politics.
On social and economic policies, the New Reform Party’s platform likewise aligns with the Yoon government in supporting the expansion of South Korea’s semiconductor industry and abolishing the Ministry of Gender Equality.
Particularly on gender issues, the New Reform Party could push the Yoon government further toward positions that appeal to younger male conservative voters, such as by introducing female military service. At present, only men are subject to South Korea’s mandatory military conscription, a policy that many younger South Korean men perceive as discrimination.
Lee Nak-yon’s New Future Party is more critical of the Yoon government’s domestic and foreign policies. However, with its platform to end two-party gridlock, the New Future Party could also seek a role as an arbitrator over contentious policy issues.
The new parties could also support the opposition Democratic Party in pressuring the Yoon government to be more accountable. Specifically, Yoon could face increased demands to approve investigations on the allegations surrounding the first lady and to solicit opposition parties’ consent for future cabinet nominations.
It is still uncertain how well the breakaway parties will perform in the upcoming election. And they face competition from another new party, the National Innovation Party, that is politically aligned with the Democratic Party.
One recent election in East Asia will give these new parties encouragement: Taiwan’s legislative election in January saw a new third party become kingmaker in the legislative assembly.
If any of the new South Korean parties are able to emerge from the election as a parliamentary kingmaker, it would represent a crack in the country’s two-party system and could free up the gridlock that has dogged parliamentary politics in recent years.",2024-03-21 13:00:00,https://theconversation.com,The Conversation UK,410,contemporary south politics traditionally dominated two main common many strong presidential could soon voter discontent smaller political upcoming parliamentary election 10 2024heading vote two main president people power party opposition democratic party hold 270 300member parliament grappling internal political prospect new breakaway making result could legislature political scientist focus east international believe outcome potential transforming domestic international south havent happy performance one 2022 survey trust national assembly 24 since unlikely confidence either main president 2022 legislative agenda met resistance national assembly education pension labor multiple national assembly yellow envelope law damage labor union legislation calling special crowd crush inside district weekend 2022 foreign policy opposition democratic party pursuit security japan face continued bilateral past colonial history opposition bilateral deal compensation forced wartime labor korea acceptance release nuclear plant pacific fall partly protest foreign policy bid overhaul cabinet national assembly motion prime minister han though dismiss net result political government democratic party face high public disapproval approval rating 40 majority expressed intention hold government accountable upcoming election supporting opposition democratic party capitalize unpopularity due similar public disapproval toward leader lee two main frequently experienced internal among supportive opposed party leadership recent opposed lee leadership respective 2024 lee former people power party chairman new reform party party seemingly cliquish party leadership faction also veto special counsel bill investigate surrounding first lady kim antigraft involvement stock price democratic party facing similar challenge also 2024 lee former prime minister previous democratic government president moon new future party former party turned bulletproof shield unpopular leader lee specifically non faction refusing step despite criminal investigation corruption breakaway new breakaway strategy take advantage south proportional election system smaller win building concentrated support among core new reform party support among younger conservative male critical older generation conservative close new future party support among traditional democratic party feel disappointed direction party several democratic party leadership lee schism within main opposition latest indicate tight race people power party democratic party 377 369 share vote respectively breakaway win even small number result could hung parliament neither main party form would leave smaller huge legislative new reform party likely partner government policy despite personal antipathy lee foreign policy new reform party expressed support pragmatic japan excessive nationalist rhetoric domestic social economic new reform platform likewise government supporting expansion south semiconductor industry ministry gender gender new reform party could push government toward appeal younger male conservative female military service present men subject south mandatory military conscription policy many younger south men perceive new future party critical domestic foreign however platform end new future party could also seek role arbitrator contentious policy new could also support opposition democratic party government accountable specifically could face approve surrounding first lady solicit opposition consent future cabinet still uncertain well breakaway perform upcoming election face competition another new party national innovation party politically democratic recent election east give new encouragement legislative election saw new third party become kingmaker legislative new south able emerge election parliamentary kingmaker would represent crack system could free dogged parliamentary politics recent breakaway threaten disrupt south system also end parliamentary

With the rise of the semiconductor industry in India, South Korea will be proactively supporting the industry, and accelerate the development of high-bandwidth memory and artificial intelligence chips to achieve the annual export target of USD 120 billion, said Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun on Thursday.
Yonhap news agency reported that “The government will support the timely establishment of related infrastructure, secure competitive technologies, promote exports, and strengthen the ecosystem of materials, parts, equipment and fabless sectors"", Ahn said during his visit to SK Hynix's semiconductor cluster construction site.
The move comes at a time when India has embarked on an ambitious semiconductor journey, with massive investments pouring in. About USD 26 billion worth of investment proposals are currently with the Indian government for semiconductor manufacturing in the country, according to industry sources.
More than USD 18 billion worth of proposals have already been cleared by the government, which includes three new semiconductor fabrication (fab) manufacturing projects worth Rs 1.25 lakh crore.
Meanwhile, SK hynix is currently seeking to build four units of fabrication plants at the site with a budget of 120 trillion won (USD 89.5 billion) by 2046, with the groundbreaking of the first unit set to start in the first quarter of 2025.
The company plans to mainly produce DRAM and NAND flash memory chips at the cluster, which will become its flagship production hub.
During the visit, Ahn said the government plans to come up with a comprehensive strategy to have South Korean businesses take the lead in the artificial intelligence sector.
In line with these efforts, the ministry plans to launch a new department dedicated to supporting the development of the cluster, along with comprehensive support measures within this month.
The government will establish plans to enhance the competitive edge of chip equipment within the first half of the year, he added.
South Korea's chip exports have been showing signs of recovery, jumping 66.7 per cent on-year to USD 9.94 billion in February. It marked the fourth consecutive month of growth and the sharpest increase since the 69.6 per cent rise tallied in October 2017.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,412,South Korea: Government will suspend licenses of striking doctors from next week,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s government will take final steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors next week as they refuse to end their weekslong walkouts that have burdened the country’s medical services, officials said Thursday.
More than 90% of the country’s 13,000 medical interns and residents have been on strike for about a month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions. Their strikes have caused hundreds of cancelled surgeries and other treatments at hospitals.
Officials say it is urgent to have more doctors because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.
The government has been taking a series of administrative steps required to suspend their licenses after they missed a government-set, Feb. 29 deadline to return to work. The steps include sending officials to formally confirm the absences of strikers, informing them of possible license suspensions and giving them chances to respond.
Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing Thursday that the government is expected to complete those steps for some of the striking doctors next week and will send them notices about its final decision to suspend their licenses.
Park earlier said that under South Korea’s medical law, the striking doctors could face at a minimum three-month suspensions and even indictments by prosecutors for refusing the government’s back-to-work order.
He urged the striking doctors to return to work immediately, suggesting those who end their strikes could receive softer punishments.
“They should return as soon as possible not only for patients but also for their future careers. This kind of exhaustive walkout from hospitals must not continue any longer,” Park said. “As we’ve said many times, we won’t treat those who return swiftly as equally as those who return late.”
It’s unclear whether and how many striking doctors would return to their hospitals at the last minute. According to Park, none of the strikers who were informed of their possible license suspension has responded.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would hurt South Korea’s medical services severely.
Two senior doctors, who lead an emergency doctors’ committee for the walkouts, were recently given government notices that their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors’ walkouts.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
The government aims to increase the country’s medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006. On Wednesday, the government announced detailed plans on how to allocate those additional 2,000 admission seats to universities, a sign that it won’t back down its plan.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.

Officials say it is urgent to have more doctors because South Korea has a rapidly aging population and its doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.

The government has been taking a series of administrative steps required to suspend their licenses after they missed a government-set, Feb. 29 deadline to return to work. The steps include sending officials to formally confirm the absences of strikers, informing them of possible license suspensions and giving them chances to respond.

Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing Thursday that the government is expected to complete those steps for some of the striking doctors next week and will send them notices about its final decision to suspend their licenses.
Park earlier said that under South Korea's medical law, the striking doctors could face at a minimum three-month suspensions and even indictments by prosecutors for refusing the government's back-to-work order.

He urged the striking doctors to return to work immediately, suggesting those who end their strikes could receive softer punishments.
“They should return as soon as possible not only for patients but also for their future careers. This kind of exhaustive walkout from hospitals must not continue any longer,"" Park said. “As we've said many times, we won't treat those who return swiftly as equally as those who return late.”

It's unclear whether and how many striking doctors would return to their hospitals at the last minute. According to Park, none of the strikers who were informed of their possible license suspension has responded.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would hurt South Korea’s medical services severely.

Two senior doctors, who lead an emergency doctors' committee for the walkouts, were recently given government notices that their licenses would be suspended for three months for allegedly inciting the junior doctors' walkouts.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.

The government aims to increase the country’s medical school enrollment cap by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006. On Wednesday, the government announced detailed plans on how to allocate those additional 2,000 admission seats to universities, a sign that it won't back down its plan.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential but low-paying specialties. But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,436,House passes bill banning sale of US personal data to foreign adversaries,"A week after the House of Representatives passed a bill that seeks to force TikTok to separate from its Chinese parent company, it passed a second bill that aims to protect Americans’ data from foreign adversaries.
The Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, or HR 7520, would prohibit data brokers from selling Americans’ personally identifiable information to foreign adversaries, including countries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Data brokers can face penalties from the Federal Trade Commission if they’re found to have sold sensitive information like location or health data to these countries. The bill sailed through the House, with all 414 lawmakers who voted opting to pass it.
The bill, led by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ), was unanimously voted out of committee alongside the TikTok bill that similarly passed the House with broad support. Lawmakers hope the combination of legislation will protect US internet users and safeguard US national security.
McMorris Rodgers and Pallone said in a joint statement Wednesday that the legislation “builds on our efforts in the House last week to pass H.R. 7521 — with overwhelming and bipartisan support — and serves as an important complement to more comprehensive national data privacy legislation, which we remain committed to working together on.”
Unlike the TikTok bill, this one does not name individual companies. But it imposes a broad limit on data brokers’ ability to “sell, license, rent, trade, transfer, release, disclose, provide access to, or otherwise make available sensitive data of a United States individual” to foreign adversaries or organizations they control. It also gives the Federal Trade Commission authority to enforce the legislation.
The sensitive data covered by the bill includes biometric and genetic information, Social Security numbers, health diagnoses or treatments, and precise geolocation data.",2024-03-20 20:46:10,https://www.theverge.com,The Verge,436,week house bill force separate parent company second bill protect data foreign protecting data foreign act 7520 would prohibit data selling personally identifiable information foreign like china russia north korea data face federal trade commission theyre found sold sensitive information like location health data bill sailed house 414 pas bill led house energy commerce committee chair member frank pallone unanimously committee alongside bill similarly house broad support hope combination legislation protect u safeguard u national pallone said joint statement legislation house last week pas 7521 overwhelming bipartisan support important complement comprehensive national data privacy legislation remain working together bill one name individual broad limit data ability sell license rent trade transfer release disclose provide access otherwise make available sensitive data united individual foreign control also federal trade commission authority enforce sensitive data covered bill biometric genetic information social security health diagnosis precise data house bill banning sale u personal data foreign
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,437,Montenegro court confirms mogul known as 'cryptocurrency king' to be extradited to South Korea,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — An appeals court in Montenegro on Wednesday confirmed that a South Korean mogul known as “the cryptocurrency king” will be handed over to his native country.
Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro. A Montenegrin court initially decided he should be handed over to the U.S. but that ruling was later overturned in favor of South Korea.
The Appeals Court of Montenegro approved an earlier ruling by the High Court to extradite Kwon to South Korea rather than the United States, a statement said. He has no further avenues for appeal.
Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York.
It was not immediately clear when Kwon would be handed over. Kwon’s lawyer in Montenegro, Goran Rodic, said that “we are content with the decision of the Appeals Court.”
“It is now a binding decision and the law envisages that further handover procedure will be handled by the justice ministries of Montenegro and South Korea, as well as the relevant police authorities who will determine the time, location and conditions of the handover,” Rodic told The Associated Press.
The 32-year-old Kwon was arrested in the Balkan nation last year over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world.
Kwon and another South Korean were arrested while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. He has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport.
Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022.

March 20 (UPI) -- Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers offense warmed up late with a four-run eighth inning -- and needed a little luck -- to edge the San Diego Padres 5-2 in the first game of the 2024 MLB season Wednesday in Seoul. Ohtani, who made his Dodgers regular-season debut, went 2 for 5 with an RBI and stolen base. Shortstop Mookie Betts went 2 for 4 with an RBI in the victory. Advertisement
Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow -- another major off-season signing -- allowed two hits and two runs over five innings, but was not on record for a decision.
""The biggest thing is that we got that W and the way we got it,"" Ohtani told reporters, according to MLB.com. ""Coming back late in the game like that proves that we're a really good team.""
Advertisement
The game between the National League West rivals is part of a two-part Seoul Series, while MLB's other 28 teams remain active in spring training. The final game of the series will be Thursday on the same field at Gocheok Sky Dome.
""It was a really cool experience,"" Glasnow said at his postgame news conference. ""It was super unique. I'm glad we got to get a win. I'm just glad it didn't spiral out. ... It's cool to get the first win here.""
Neither team logged a hit in the first inning in front of the nearly 16,000 fans in attendance Wednesday in South Korea's capital city.
The Padres ended the deadlock in the third, when second baseman Xander Bogaerts plated third baseman Tyler Wade with a line drive single to center field.
Dodgers right fielder Jason Heyward tied the score with an RBI sacrifice fly in the top of the fourth. The Padres went ahead for the second time when designated hitter Manny Machado scored while catcher Luis Campusano grounded into a double play in the bottom of the fourth.

The Dodgers threatened with two baserunners in the fifth and one in the sixth and seventh, but could not level the score into their eighth-inning outburst.
Glasnow retired the Padres in order in the fifth, but was replaced in the sixth. Relief pitchers Ryan Brasier, Daniel Hudson, Joe Kelly and Evan Phillips allowed just two hits, while not issuing a walk or surrendering a run, over the final four innings.
Padres relief pitcher Wandy Peralta walked Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy to start the eighth. Outfielder Teoscar Hernandez followed with a single to center off Padres reliever Jhony Brito, sending Muncy to second.
Brito followed with a four-pitch walk of Dodgers center fielder James Outman. Muncy then came in to score the game-tying run on a sacrifice fly from outfielder Enrique Hernandez.
The Dodgers caught a lucky break en route to the go-ahead run.
Second baseman Gavin Lux started that play when he chopped an Adrian Morejon sinker between first and second base. Padres first baseman Jake Cronenworth went to field the ball, but it went through a gap of webbing in his glove and rolled into the outfield, allowing Teoscar Hernandez to score from second base.

Betts swatted a ground-ball single to left three pitches later for a 4-2 Dodgers lead. Ohtani hit the next pitch to left, plating Lux for the final run of the game. Kelly and Phillips then took the mound and held back the Padres offense over the final two innings.
""I thought Tyler kept his wits about him and kept us in the ballgame,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. ""The offense came alive at the end. It was a good ballgame. I expect more games like this.""
Bogaerts went 2 for 4 with an RBI for the Padres. Padres starter Yu Darvish allowed two hits and a run, while issuing three walks and three strikeouts, over 3 2/3 innings. He was not on record for a decision.
Ohtani, who underwent elbow surgery in September and will not pitch this season, recorded the hardest hit of the game. His third-inning single off Darvish traveled 112.3 mph off his bat, according to Statcast.
Game 2 will air at 6:05 a.m. EDT Thursday on ESPN. Joe Musgrove is expected to start for the Padres. Fellow right-handed pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto -- who signed a $325 million deal in December -- will start for the Dodgers.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,442,Japan v North Korea World Cup qualifier resumes rivalry that extends beyond football,"A place at the next football World Cup is not all that is at stake when Japan and North Korea meet on Thursday for the first of two qualifying matches, in a resumption of one of the fiercest rivalries in international football.
Despite the huge gap between the countries’ economies and the profiles of their domestic leagues, few expect the match at Tokyo’s national stadium to be a walkover for the Japanese, who are 18th in the Fifa rankings, 96 places above their opponents.
Meetings between the two countries have always been about more than football. On one side, a former colonial power allied to Pyongyang’s arch-enemy, the US; on the other, a dictatorship that has sent ballistic missiles over Japan and abducted dozens of its citizens.
Pundits expect the Samurai Blue to win in front of a highly partisan crowd, but they will be in unfamiliar, hostile territory five days later for the return leg at the 50,000-seat Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang. With a week to go before kick-off for that second match, it was not clear if North Korean supporters – mainly military and party elites – would be allowed to attend.
Geopolitics is never far away when the two teams meet. The qualifiers for the 2026 tournament, co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, come soon after the North test-launched short-range ballistic missiles and the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, oversaw a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable rocket launchers designed to target Seoul. The country’s million-strong army, Kim said this week, should “prepare for war”.
The visiting players, who were permitted to travel as an exception to sanctions barring North Koreans from entering Japan, will not be without support. Among the expected 68,000 crowd will be several thousand members of Japan’s 150,000-strong North Korean community, many of whom are descended from people forcibly brought to work in Japan during Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula.

The 4,000 tickets for seats in the North Korean section of the stadium sold out immediately, while the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan – North Korea’s de facto embassy – urged ethnic minority zainichi Koreans with connections to the North to cheer for the visitors.
Risa Ho, an ethnic North Korean living in Tokyo, said she would be supporting the visitors on Thursday. “I love Japanese footballers and I usually support Japan, but not when they play North Korea,” said Ho, who will be in the crowd at the national stadium.
“It’s complicated, and I feel a little bit conflicted, but when it comes to the national team I want to support North Korea,” added Ho, who predicted some frank exchanges between rival supporters on Thursday. “The political backdrop means these games always have an edge.”
As for the result, Ho predicted a 2-1 win for Japan, but believed North Korea would still make the World Cup finals. “North Korea is putting a lot of effort into improving its sports teams, and that includes football,” she said, adding that Kim, known for his love of NBA basketball, also followed football.
North Korea have historically punched well above their weight in international football. At the 1966 World Cup in England, the unknown team stunned Italy with a 1-0 win in a decisive group match, only to be beaten 5-3 by Portugal in the quarter-final after leading 3-0.
View image in fullscreen North Korea triumphed unexpectedly against Italy in the 1966 World Cup in a game held at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough. That same spirit should drive the underdogs in the fixtures against Japan. Photograph: PA Photos/PA
Their record against Japan suggests that the results of the two games are far from fait accompli for the Samurai Blue, who began their World Cup campaign with comfortable wins over Asian minnows Syria and Myanmar. In the two countries’ 20 meetings since 1975, the men’s senior teams have each won eight and drawn four.
Previous fixtures between North Korea and Japan have occasionally seen the mutual animosity spill over on to the pitch. The Japan U-23’s 2-1 victory over the North at the Asian Games last October was marred when members of the losing team clashed with match officials and security staff.
“I admit that our players were a little bit over-excited in the match, but that’s football,” North Korea’s coach, Sin Yong Nam, said afterwards. “But there are confrontations in football matches … I think our behaviour was acceptable.”
When the countries’ women’s teams played each other in Tokyo last month, North Korean fans turned a section of the stadium into a blanket of red, with some waving flags urging their players to “protect the dignity of the republic” – a reference to North Korea’s official name the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).
Like other athletes from the secretive country, the players were confined to their accommodation, training ground and stadium, and banned from speaking to Japanese or South Koreans, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
Contests between Korean and Japanese teams can summon mixed emotions among younger ethnic Koreans in Japan.
“I was born and brought up in Japan, so to be honest, I knew the Japan players’ names and faces better than the DPRK players from seeing them on TV,” An Yong-hak, a former North Korean international, told Agence France-Presse this week.
“But I am an ethnic Korean, and my name is An Yong-hak. I thought of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as my national team, and I always worked hard with that in mind.”

As North Korea attempt to qualify for their first World Cup since 2010, An attempted to play down the historical and political tensions that have made this one of the qualifying rounds’ most anticipated matches.
Recalling his team’s injury-time defeat against Japan in a World Cup qualifier in 2006, he held out hope that, whatever the result on Thursday, fair play will prevail.
“After that game we all shook hands and waved to the Japanese fans,” An said. “It was a great game that went beyond the result, and I hope this time is the same.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,443,Seoul MLB opener: Shohei Ohtani makes winning debut for Dodgers,"Seoul, South Korea CNN —
Shohei Ohtani’s Los Angeles Dodgers brought Major League Baseball (MLB) to South Korea on Wednesday night, overshadowing Seoul hometown star Kim Ha-seong’s San Diego Padres in a 5-2 victory.
The first clash of the two-game Seoul Series opened the MLB season and showcased an international appeal brought to the sport by an increasing lineup of Asian stars led by two-way Japanese star Ohtani, who joined the Dodgers in the offseason, signing the richest deal ever made by a major leaguer.
Earlier on Wednesday, South Korea police said they had received a report about an email threatening to detonate a bomb during the game to hurt Ohtani.
About 150 police officers were dispatched to the stadium to search for any threats, but they found no explosives.

The biggest name in baseball worldwide
Clearly, thousands of those in Seoul’s Gocheok Skydome were there to see Ohtani, who delivered two hits, an RBI and a stolen base to please the crowd.
Ohtani’s wife – Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka – was also in attendance, with the ESPN broadcast showing her giving high fives to some of the women in nearby seats after one of her husband’s hits.
Ohtani may be the biggest name in baseball worldwide, but in South Korea, the top billing belongs to Padres shortstop Kim Ha-seong.
The Korean star garnered the biggest cheers from the crowd and his San Diego team clearly was the home team – and it deserved to be. After all, the Skydome used to be Kim’s home stadium when he played for the Kiwoom Heroes in the Korea Baseball Organization’s (KBO) League.
When Padres starter Yu Darvish got out of a bases-loaded jam with a strikeout in the top of the third inning, the stadium erupted with applause.
But when the Dodgers loaded the bases again in the eighth inning with no outs, it was too much for the Padres to turn back, as the LA team erupted for four runs to seal the win.

The Dodgers rally drew loud cheers from the fans, demonstrating a local excitement that MLB decided to bring its biggest star to Seoul to start the season.
This was an MLB game that showcased Asia both on and off the diamond. Not only were the most popular players Asian, the between-innings entertainment featured each team’s cheerleaders performing K-pop routines.
Korean fan Park Jun-hyuk said he was at the stadium to see Ohtani.
Ohtani “is like the best player you’d see in 100 years. And the fact that such a player is in South Korea as a Dodgers player to play in the opening game is so meaningful that I decided to come here,” Park told CNN.
Motoki Sato, a 26-year-old from Japan, said he’s followed Ohtani since he was a high school star, though this was his first time to see the two-way superstar in person. It was also Sato’s first Dodgers game.
“Previously, I supported the Angles, the team where Ohtani was at,” Sato said as he smiled.
He was wearing Dodger colors on Wednesday, like thousands of others in the crowd, many of them scoring their merchandise in a souvenir tent outside the stadium before gametime.
More than two hours before the first pitch, a line wound around the MLB merchandise tent as staff let fans inside in groups to prevent crowding in the store. Anybody wearing team merchandise had it tagged before going in.
Inside, less expensive souvenirs were mostly sold out, while the prized Ohtani number jerseys were pulled off the shelves almost as soon as they were displayed.
The Padres side of the store was less frenzied, but still busy. South Korea’s Kim was a favorite.
The Seoul Series, a two-game series between the two teams, features the first MLB regular-season games played in Korea. It’s the ninth time that MLB has opened its season outside the 50 US states and Canada. The last time that happened was in 2019, when the Oakland Athletics faced the Seattle Mariners in Tokyo.

Padres shortstop Kim, who is from Bucheon (about 15.5 miles away from Seoul), received a warm ovation from the crowd for his first at-bat in the bottom of the second inning.
He was making his return to the ballpark where he played for the Kiwoom Heroes. He acknowledged the crowd by raising his batting helmet. Kim went 0-for-3 with a walk on the night.
Brenda and Gerardo Marquez had traveled from San Diego to Seoul for the two-game series, lucky winners of tickets for reserved for Padres fans.
They had to see Kim play in his home country.
“It’s all about Ha-Seong Kim for us tonight, so looking for that win and to see him here at home,” said Brenda Marquez.
Gerardo said the couple, who came to Seoul with their three young daughters, made reservations to be here even before they won the ticket lottery.

The Padres might have lost, but the trip was still a win-win for the Marquez family. Their daughters are huge BTS fans – “obsessed with them,” said Gerardo – while Brenda said she would have been satisfied to be just near the stadium.

According to multiple reports, Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul, South Korea — where the Dodgers will play the Padres on Thursday at 6 a.m. Eastern — was the target of a bomb threat that specifically named superstar Shohei Ohtani.
An email that police received in Seoul, according to the San Diego Tribune, threatened to detonate a bomb at the stadium during the game.

Nevertheless, the Los Angeles Times reported that the threat — which was written in English — was not credible and written by someone who has done similar acts in the past.
Yonhap News Agency in Korea reported that local police were attempting to track down the person who sent the bomb threat and that 30 commandos and 120 personnel were being sent to search Gocheok Sky Dome, though “no dangerous or suspicious situation has been found yet.”
MLB released a statement, according to multiple outlets, saying it was working to ensure the safety of all involved ahead of the highly anticipated opener.
“The safety and security of our fans and everyone in the ballparks where we play are always our first priority,” the statement read. “MLB Security works closely with local officials to ensure a safe environment for all those who attend our games.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,463,Dodgers fire Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter Ippei Mizuhara amid ‘massive theft’ allegations,"By Andy McCullough, Fabian Ardaya, Sam Blum and Britt Ghiroli
The Los Angeles Dodgers have fired Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, after Ohtani’s representatives accused Mizuhara of engaging in a “massive theft,” using the player’s money to place bets with an allegedly illegal bookmaker under federal investigation.
“In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft, and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,” Berk Brettler LLP, the firm representing Ohtani, said in a statement.
Advertisement
The accusation by Berk Brettler followed an inquiry from The Los Angeles Times. The newspaper learned Ohtani’s name surfaced in an investigation of an Orange County resident named Matthew Bowyer. Mizuhara, 39, placed bets with Bowyer, according to the newspaper.
Mizuhara did not respond to a request for comment. Ohtani is not currently facing discipline, according to an MLB official.
“The Dodgers are aware of media reports and are gathering information,” the club said in a statement. “The team can confirm that interpreter Ippei Mizuhara has been terminated. The team has no further comment at this time.”
Ohtani’s involvement initially was described as aiding Mizuhara, as a spokesman for Ohtani said the player transferred the funds to cover Mizuhara’s gambling debt. Mizuhara reportedly gave his account in a 90-minute interview with ESPN on Tuesday in which he said Ohtani paid off gambling debts totaling roughly $4.5 million and did not give the money to Mizuhara directly because he didn’t trust his interpreter to not “gamble it away.” Before Mizuhara’s interview published, the spokesman disavowed Mizuhara’s account and said Ohtani’s lawyers would issue a statement.
Mizuhara said on Wednesday that Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activity, debts or attempts to pay them.
Ohtani made his Dodger debut Wednesday evening in Seoul, South Korea, against the San Diego Padres. He is in the first year of a 10-year, $700 million contract, with $680 million in deferrals. Mizuhara has worked with Ohtani since the player debuted with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018.
Ohtani and Mizuhara’s relationship, which dates back to Ohtani’s days with the Nippon Ham Fighters of NPB, is closer than most between players and interpreters. For much of the last seven years, they were rarely seen apart. They drove to the ballpark together, with Mizuhara essentially serving as Ohtani’s driver before the two-way star got his driver’s license in his early seasons with the Angels. Whenever Ohtani threw, Mizuhara would be close behind, with either a phone camera recording his mechanics or a pocket radar gun tracking data. Mizuhara told The Athletic last year he saw Ohtani more than his own wife, and that the pair even spent Christmas in Los Angeles working out together.

During baseball’s lockout in 2022, when players and club staff weren’t able to interact, Mizuhara quit his job so he could continue to work alongside Ohtani.
In a lighthearted moment this spring at Dodgerfest, in front of a packed crowd at Dodger Stadium, former Angels and current Dodgers radio personality José Mota asked Ohtani to define their relationship. He immediately started laughing.
“We’re not friends,” he deadpanned through Mizuhara, “we’re business partners.”
Most major leaguers play catch with teammates or receive instruction from coaches. That was not the case with Ohtani. When the two-way superstar went out to throw plyo balls against the outfield wall, he did it with Mizuhara. When a new pitcher came into the game with Ohtani on deck, it was Mizuhara who walked out with the iPad to break down his new matchup.
Mizuhara became a fan favorite in Anaheim — so much so that when the public address announcer introduced players and staff last season before the home opener, Mizuhara received the second loudest ovation from the crowd, behind only Ohtani.
According to a league source, MLB hasn’t been contacted by prosecutors. The MLBPA declined comment, and Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, declined multiple requests for comment.
Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani as recently as Wednesday night’s season-opening win against the Padres in Seoul, South Korea. Ahead of the flight, Ohtani, Mizuhara and their wives posed with Yoshinobu Yamamoto and his interpreter, Yoshihiro Sonoda, for a photo. Ohtani posted the photo to his Instagram. When reporters approached Wednesday to talk to Ohtani about the game, Mizuhara had ducked out into the hallway of the clubhouse, emerging only at the end of Ohtani’s scrum with reporters and interpreting three brief English questions about the game.
According to ESPN, Mizuhara addressed the Dodgers clubhouse to discuss the upcoming story about his gambling. The scene of people pouring out of the clubhouse before media was let in included Dodgers owner Mark Walter and CEO Stan Kasten.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,464,North Korea claims progress in developing a hypersonic missile designed to strike distant US targets,"North Korea successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile, state media reported on Wednesday, claiming a progress in efforts to develop a more powerful, agile missile designed to strike faraway US targets in the region.
A hypersonic missile is among an array of high-tech weapons systems that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly vowed to introduce in 2021 to cope with what he called deepening US hostility.
Outside experts say Kim wants a modernised weapons arsenal to wrest US concessions like sanctions relief when diplomacy resumes.
On Tuesday, Kim guided the ground jet test of the multi-stage solid-fuel engine for the hypersonic missile at the North's northwestern rocket launch facility, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.
It cited Kim as saying the strategic value of the new missile with an intermediate-range is as important as intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland and that ""enemies know better about it"".
It said that a timetable for completing the development of the new weapons system was ""set through the great success in the important test"".
Intermediate-range missiles possessed or pursued by North Korea are the weapons systems primarily aimed at attacking the US Pacific territory of Guam, home to US military bases.
Those missile can also reach Alaska, and with a range adjustment they can be used to strike closer targets like US military installations in Japan's Okinawa island, experts say.
In recent years, North Korea has been pushing to develop more weapons with built-in solid propellants, which make launches harder to detect than liquid-propellant missiles that must be fuelled before liftoffs and cannot last long.
The North's pursuit of hypersonic weapons is also meant to defeat US and South Korean missile defence systems, but it's unclear the North's hypersonic vehicles proved their desired speed and maneuverability during tests in recent years, analysts say.
In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic, maneuverable warhead, in a likely reference to the missile mentioned in Wednesday's KCNA dispatch.
In November, North Korea said it had tested engine tests for an intermedia-range missile but didn't say whether it's designed to carry a hypersonic warhead.
While the North's missile test in January was likely related to the development of its first-stage rocket, this week's engine test appeared focused on the development of its second-stage rocket in part of the North's efforts to increase the weapon's flying speed, said Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea's Research Institute for National Strategy.
Chang said the latest engine test suggests North Korea could soon test-launch the new hypersonic missile.
After short-range tests with hypersonic weapons, North Korea would want to increase their ranges with maneuverable hypersonic warheads, Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute, said. He said the capacities of the new missile can be assessed when it's test-flighted.
On Monday, South Korea, the US and Japan said they detected the multiple ballistic missile test-launches by North Korea in what was the country's first missile firings in about a month. The North said on Tuesday it performed a live-fire drill of what it called nuclear-capable ""super-large"" multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea's capital, Seoul. South Korea's military later said it views the North Korean weapons system tested as a ballistic missile.
North Korea has been engaging in a provocative run of missile tests since 2022. The US and South Korea militaries have responded by expanding their bilateral exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan. Observers say North Korea will likely intensify its run of missile tests ahead of the US presidential election in November.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,465,North Korea claims progress in developing a hypersonic missile designed to strike distant US targets,"North Korea successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile, state media reported Wednesday, claiming a progress in efforts to develop a more powerful, agile missile designed to strike faraway US targets in the region.
A hypersonic missile is among an array of high-tech weapons systems that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly vowed to introduce in 2021 to cope with what he called deepening US hostility. Outside experts say Kim wants a modernized weapons arsenal to wrest US concessions like sanctions relief when diplomacy resumes.
On Tuesday, Kim guided the ground jet test of multi-stage solid-fuel engine for the hypersonic missile at the North’s northwestern rocket launch facility, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.

It cited Kim as saying the strategic value of the new missile with an intermediate-range is as important as intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland and that “enemies know better about it”. It said that a timetable for completing the development of the new weapons system was “set through the great success in the important test”.
Intermediate-range missiles possessed or pursued by North Korea are the weapons systems primarily aimed at attacking the US Pacific territory of Guam, home to US military bases. With a range adjustment, missiles can be used to strike closer targets like US military installations in Japan’s Okinawa island, experts say.
In recent years, North Korea has been pushing to develop more weapons with built-in solid propellants, which make launches harder to detect than liquid-propellant missiles that must be fuelled before liftoffs and cannot last long. The North’s pursuit of hypersonic weapons is also meant to defeat US and South Korean missile defence systems, but it’s unclear the North’s hypersonic vehicles consistently maintained a desired speed exceeding Mach 5 during tests in 2021 and 2022, experts say.
In January, North Korea said it flight-tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead, in an apparent reference to the missile mentioned in Wednesday’s KCNA dispatch. In November, North Korea said it had tested engine tests for the missile.

On Monday, South Korea, the US and Japan said they detected the multiple ballistic missile test-launches by North Korea in what was the country’s first missile firings in about a month. The North said Tuesday it performed a live-fire drill of what it called nuclear-capable “super-large” multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea’s capital, Seoul. South Korea’s military later said it views the North Korean weapons system tested as a ballistic missile.
North Korea has been engaging in a provocative run of missile tests since 2022.

State media said on Wednesday that North Korea has successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile. The country claims this is a step forward in its ambitions to produce a more potent, manoeuvrable missile that will be able to attack far-off US targets in the region.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has openly committed to introducing a range of advanced weaponry in 2021, including a hypersonic missile, in response to what he claims is growing US hostility. Outside analysts claim that when negotiation starts, Kim will want US concessions including the lifting of sanctions in exchange for an upgraded armaments stockpile.

According to the official Korean Central News Agency, Kim oversaw the multi-stage solid-fuel engine ground test for the hypersonic missile on Tuesday at the North’s northwest rocket launch site.
It cited Kim as saying the strategic value of the new missile with an intermediate-range is as important as intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland and that “enemies know better about it.” It said that a timetable for completing the development of the new weapons system was “set through the great success in the important test.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,467,"Chan Ho Park, first Korean player in MLB, will throw the first pitch in the Seoul Series","A retired Korean baseball legend is returning to the mound for the first game of the Major League Baseball regular season — and the first ever held in South Korea.
Former pitcher Chan Ho Park, the first Korean-born athlete to play in MLB, is scheduled to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the season opener in Seoul on Wednesday between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres. Park made his debut with the Dodgers in 1994 and played with the Padres from 2005 to 2006.
“I think that it’s sort of a culmination for him,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, a former teammate of Park’s, told The Athletic about Park’s first pitch. “He was a pioneer as a Korean-born player to come to the States and to be a star player.”
Park will kick off a two-game “Seoul Series” between the teams at the Gocheok SkyDome, marking not only the first games of the regular season but also the first regular season games ever played in Korea.

Park’s debut as a reliever against the Atlanta Braves forged a new path for other Korean baseball stars, including former MLB players Byung-Hyun Kim and Hyun Jin Ryu and current Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim. During his 17 years in the league, Park, known as “The Korean Express,” also spent time with the New York Mets, the Philadelphia Phillies, the New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
His career in the U.S. concluded with the Pirates on Oct. 1, 2010, with a win against the Florida Marlins that helped him clinch the MLB record for most wins by an Asian pitcher.
“I became a messenger to the people for a lot of positive,” Park told The Athletic, reflecting on the pressure he experienced representing Korea. “And they were cheering me up, but I had to pitch well to cheer them up, the whole country.”
Today, Park, who retired from playing baseball in 2012 with the Hanwha Eagles in South Korea, is still involved in the game as a baseball operations adviser with the Padres.
While Park’s appearance is highly anticipated, Korean fans have also been awaiting the return of Kim, a former favorite in the country’s Korean Baseball Organization League, who in November became the first Asian-born infielder to win MLB’s Gold Glove Award. Two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani will also make his debut with the Dodgers during the series after he clinched the largest contract in North American sports history and signed for $700 million over 10 years.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,469,T1 LoL team gives shoutout to San Diego Padres ahead of MLB games in Korea,"Major League Baseball is opening its 2024 season with two games in Seoul this week and arguably the most successful sporting franchise in Korea right now, T1’s League of Legends team, has declared its allegiance to one of the two teams coming to Seoul for the opening series.
Recommended Videos
In a video posted to social media earlier today, the five starters of T1’s League World Championship-winning squad each donned San Diego Padres jerseys and gave a quick shoutout to the team.
T1 most definitely chose the Padres as their team because of the team’s strong ties to Korea. The Padres’ shortstop, Ha-Seong Kim, is a Korean baseball star who made a name for himself with the Kiwoom Heroes in the KBO before joining the Padres in 2020. T1 mentioned Kim by name in the video, congratulating him on becoming the first Korean player to win a Gold Glove award, which he captured after the 2023 MLB season.
England has The Beatles, Korea has Ha-Seong. pic.twitter.com/XQSUr65Gh9 — San Diego Padres (@Padres) March 18, 2024
The team also gave some recognition to Woo-Suk Go, a pitcher for the Padres of Korean descent, who is making his MLB debut this year after spending the first four years of his career in the KBO. T1 ADC Gumayusi gave a special shoutout to Woo-Suk Go as the pitcher apparently has a reputation for maining ADC himself in League.
Tomorrow’s games between the Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers will be the first games of the 2024 MLB regular season. While other teams are still participating in Spring Training, the two NL West squads will begin their season with real games that actually count toward the 162-game schedule.
When the Seoul Series begins tomorrow, MLB fans in America will finally know League of Legends fans’ pain as they’ll have to wake up super early to watch the games. First pitch for tomorrow’s season opener between the Padres and Dodgers is scheduled for 5:05am CT.

SEOUL, South Korea (KABC) -- As the Dodgers gear up for their first regular-season game against the Padres in Seoul, Eyewitness News is getting to try all the delicious street foods that South Korea has to offer.
Our team visited the bustling Myeong-dong shopping area for a taste of all the mouth-watering dishes. During the food tour, they ran into some Dodger fans.
The stand-outs included the hard candy, which is a skewer of fresh fruit coated in a crunchy sugar shell.
""The candied fruit was really good. That was so good,"" said Danielle Umali of Pasadena.
Another hit was from Starchicken, a stand with a strikingly familiar logo that U.S. coffee lovers might recognize. ABC7's Rob Fukuzaki tried the sweet and sour version.
The team flew to Seoul last week and is doing all they can to get on a consistent clock. It wasn't easy following a 13-hour flight and a 16-hour time difference, and the Padres are on the same boat.
Everything that they tried evoked a sentiment similar to that expressed by Lorena from Los Angeles.
""Oh my god... the food! I'm like, I'm moving to South Korea when I retire. This amazing. It's delicious and the hospitality has been outstanding.""
The two-game series between the Dodgers and Padres, called the Seoul Series, will be on Wednesday and Thursday, and they'll be the first ever regular-season games to be played in Korea.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,473,Dodgers vs. Padres in Korea: Everything to know as 2024 MLB regular season kicks off with Seoul Series,"For the first time ever, Major League Baseball regular-season games will be played in South Korea. The NL West rival Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will begin the 2024 season with a pair of games in Seoul, South Korea, starting on Wednesday. The games will be played at the Gocheok Sky Dome, home of the Korea Baseball Organization's Kiwoom Heroes.
""I'm really looking forward to it, learning more about the culture, the city,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said at the Winter Meetings in December. ""Obviously there's a lot of good ball players there, and so for us and the Padres to go over there and showcase and play two regular-season games, it's good for baseball. I'm excited.""
This is the first time MLB will open the regular season with games played internationally since 2019, when the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners began the year in Tokyo. Those two games are notable for being the final two games of Ichiro Suzuki's Hall of Fame career. Here are the details for the two-game Seoul Series:

Both games will start at 7:05 p.m. local time in Seoul, so they're night games in South Korea and early-morning games in the United States. The Dodgers and Padres each played a pair of exhibition games against KBO clubs and Team Korea this past weekend to prepare for the Seoul Series. Both teams have also participated in youth clinics and other promotional events in recent days.
The Padres will serve as the home team on March 20, and the Dodgers will serve as the home team on March 21. Here are six things to know for MLB's first-ever Seoul Series.
1. Park will throw out the first pitch
Chan-Ho Park, the first Korean-born player in MLB history and also a former Dodger and Padre, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to the March 20 season opener.
Park, 50, made his MLB debut with the Dodgers in April 1994. He was an All-Star with Los Angeles in 2001 and he played parts of 17 seasons in the big leagues with seven different teams. Park went 124-98 with a 4.36 ERA in 1,993 MLB innings.
Park has been a special advisor in San Diego's front office since 2017.
2. It's a homecoming for Kim
Ha-seong Kim SD • SS • #7 2023 stats BA 0.260 R 84 HR 17 RBI 60 SB 38 View Profile
Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim was born and raised just outside Seoul and, in addition to returning to his home country, is also returning to his home ballpark for the Seoul Series. He starred for the Kiwoom Heroes (previously Nexen Heroes) from 2014-20 and the Gocheok Sky Dome was his home stadium. Expect Kim to receive a hero's welcome at his old stomping grounds.
""I don't have a specific favorite moment,"" Kim told MLB.com last summer when asked about his time as a KBO player. ""I remember all the games I played there. I can recall everything. I would say all the moments were great. I played hard and I'm proud of it.""
It should be noted that the Gocheok Sky Dome has been upgraded this season. The building has new lights, new turf, and renovated clubhouses, among other things.
With the Heroes, Kim was a three-time Golden Glove winner, which is given annually to the best all-around player at each position. It's not strictly a defensive award. Kim, who is now playing shortstop for San Diego, authored a .294/.373/.493 batting line in seven KBO seasons. He signed a four-year, $28 million contract with the Padres in January 2021 and will be a free agent after 2024.
3. Each team will bring extra players
This is not exactly a surprise. The Dodgers and Padres will use a standard 26-man roster for the two Seoul Series games, though each team brought five extra players on the trip as potential injury replacements and also to play in those two exhibition games leading up to the Seoul Series. Here are the 31 players the Dodgers took to South Korea:
There was some question about whether Blake Treinen, who took a comebacker to the midsection last week, would be healthy enough to make the trip, but he is indeed on the travel roster. Treinen did not pitch at all last season as he recovered from shoulder surgery.
Now here are the 31 players the Padres have on the trip:
Note that Dylan Cease, who came over from the Chicago White Sox in a trade last week, is on the travel roster, though he is not scheduled to pitch. He had to fly to Seoul later after being traded too late to make the team charter.
4. A starter could pitch in relief
Michael King SD • RP • #34 2023 stats ERA 2.75 WHIP 1.15 IP 104.2 BB 32 K 127 View Profile
Padres manager Mike Shildt said Michael King, who will be part of the rotation this season, will be available out of the bullpen for the Seoul Series. It's a two-game series with a seven-day break until the next regular-season game, so King won't be needed to start a third game because there is no third game in this series. Using him out of the bullpen makes perfect sense.
""I was pumped (when I was told I would be used out of the bullpen in Seoul),"" King told MLB.com recently. ""Because I really just want to pitch in that atmosphere. I'm sure it would've been a great atmosphere if I started one of those exhibition games (against a KBO team). But when the games matter, you want to pitch in the games that matter.""
Pitching out of the bullpen will be nothing new for King, who came over from the New York Yankees in the Juan Soto trade. From 2022 through mid-August 2023, King was a dynamic setup man for New York, throwing 116 innings with 143 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA. He then moved to the rotation and had a 1.88 ERA in eight starts to close out 2023.
5. More international games are coming
The Seoul Series is part of MLB's international push. It is neither the first nor the last set of international games MLB will play in 2024. The Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays played two exhibition games in the Dominican Republic on March 9 and 10. Here's the rest of 2024's international slate:
Dates Location Teams March 20-21 Seoul, South Korea Dodgers vs. Padres March 24-25 Mexico City, Mexico Yankees vs. Diablos Rojos del Mexico (exhibition games) April 27-28 Mexico City, Mexico Houston Astros vs. Colorado Rockies June 8-9 London, England New York Mets vs. Philadelphia Phillies
The two Yankees vs. Diablo Rojos games are exhibition games (Diablo Rojos are the Yankees of the Mexican League in terms of championships, historic significance, etc.). All the other international series listed above are regular-season games, though Seoul is the only new location. MLB has already played regular-season games in Mexico City and London.
6. The Dodgers and Padres still have to finish spring training
After the Seoul Series, the Dodgers and Padres will head to Southern California and wrap up their exhibition season. It's a long trip with a big-time change – a 13 or so hour flight from spring training in Phoenix to Seoul and a 16-hour time difference – and the two teams will have several days to adjust back to normal after the two games. Here are their upcoming schedules:

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,474,Russia's Putin to visit China in May,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to China in May for talks with Xi Jinping, in what could be the Kremlin chief’s first overseas trip of his new presidential term, according to five sources familiar with the matter.
Western governments on Monday condemned Putin’s re-election as unfair and undemocratic. But China, India and North Korea congratulated the veteran leader on extending his rule by a further six years, highlighting geopolitical fault lines that have widened since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
“Putin will visit China,” one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The details were independently confirmed by four other sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

Another of the sources said Putin’s trip to China would probably take place in the second half of May. Two of the sources said the Putin visit would come before Xi’s planned trip to Europe.
The Kremlin, when asked about the Reuters report, said information on Putin’s visits would be released closer to the date.
“Several presidential visits and several high-level contacts are being prepared at the moment,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We will inform you as we get closer.”
China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership in February 2022 when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two.
The United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat while U.S. President Joe Biden argues that this century will be defined by an existential contest between democracies and autocracies.
Putin and Xi share a broad world view, which sees the West as decadent and in decline just as China challenges U.S. supremacy in everything from quantum computing and synthetic biology to espionage and hard military power.
Putin and Xi
China has strengthened its trade and military ties with Russia in recent years as the United States and its allies imposed sanctions against both countries, particularly Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine.

Foreign diplomats and observers said they expected Putin to make China his first stop after being re-elected. Putin’s formal presidential inauguration is due to take place around May 7.
Putin told reporters on Sunday that Russia and China shared a similar global outlook and enjoyed resilient relations in part due to his good personal relations with Xi, and that Moscow and Beijing would develop ties further in coming years.
Xi visited Russia in his first post-pandemic overseas trip in March last year, shortly after commencing his precedent-breaking third term as Chinese president.
The two leaders have often touted their close personal friendship and have met over 40 times, most recently in October when Putin was the guest of honour at China’s Belt and Road summit in Beijing.

China-Russia trade hit $218.2 billion during January-November, according to Chinese customs data, exceeding a goal to increase bilateral trade to over $200 billion by 2024 that was set by the two countries.
Xi, in a call with Putin last month, said both sides should resolutely oppose interference in domestic affairs by external forces, indicating the U.S.
Chinese vice foreign minister Sun Weidong said bilateral ties were “at their best in history” when meeting his Russian counterpart in Moscow last month, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
China is considering taking part in a peace conference aimed at ending the war in Ukraine to be hosted by neutral Switzerland in the coming months, its ambassador to Bern told local media on Monday.

- The chainsaw -
Before the election in which he trounced Argentina's traditional political parties, Milei would campaign with a powered-up chainsaw to symbolize his plans to cut a bloated state.
Once in office, he cut the cabinet in half to nine ministries, slashed 50,000 public jobs, suspended all new public works contracts and ripped away generous fuel and transport subsidies.
The government has boasted its first budget surplus in over a decade and has won the approval of the International Monetary Fund which has a $44 billion credit program with Argentina.
""Stabilization is working, better than one originally imagined, but there are questions about governance,"" independent economist Marina Dal Poggetto said in a recent television interview.
Milei has come under fire for shutting down the state news agency and anti-discrimination agency, and removing funding for scientific research and the cinema industry.
- Political hurdles -
Legally speaking, Milei's ambitious plans have not gone according to plan.
His party is a minority in Congress, and rivals have repeatedly beaten back his flagship reforms.
The Senate last week rejected a ""mega-decree"" that seeks to alter or repeal more than 300 existing standards, such as removing rent caps and relaxing labor laws.
However, it only needs approval by one house to become law, and the decree has yet to go before the chamber of deputies.
But even if it does pass, analysts say its constitutionality is in question.
In February a separate Omnibus Law, which seeks to make changes to the economy, politics and even some aspects of private life, was thrown out by lawmakers for a rewrite.
""Milei would like to promote his political and economic project at 100 kilometers per hour, but the government's cruising speed is much lower,"" Carlos Malamud, a researcher at the Elcano Royal Institute, told AFP.
- Misery and hunger -
Milei took office warning things would get much worse for Argentines before they get better, and they have.
He started out by devaluating the peso by 54 percent, and removing price controls.
These measures, along with the removal of fuel and transport subsidies, have seen Argentines' purchasing power plummet, causing a slowdown in consumption and economic growth.
Monthly inflation is starting to cool, but annual inflation stood at 276 percent in February.
In the absence of recent official figures, a private thinktank estimated that some 57 percent of the country is now living in poverty.
Meanwhile, the government has frozen aid to some 40,000 soup kitchens pending an audit of their operations.
On Monday, police fired teargas and used water cannon against thousands protesting the austerity measures.
""The hunger in the neighborhoods is terrible. They haven't delivered goods to the soup kitchens for four months and the kids need it,"" Maria Medina, from the leftist organization Polo Obrero told AFP.
- The Pope, Trump and Israel -
Milei has not stopped courting controversy since swapping the colorful campaign trail for the presidency.
A social media junkie, he trashes his opponents online -- such as the lawmakers who ditched his reforms -- praises himself and shares bizarre memes.
He recently raised eyebrows for telling a group of high-school students that he considers abortion to be ""murder"" and banning the use of gender-inclusive language in the military and public sector.
During a speech to world leaders in Davos in January, he took aim at socialism, ""radical feminism,"" the ""bloody agenda of abortion"" and ""social justice.""
He flew to Rome to meet with Argentine Pope Francis -- with whom he reconciled after repeatedly insulting him on the campaign trail -- and met with former U.S. president Donald Trump on the sidelines of a conservative conference.

MIDTERMS. The Senate electoral reforms panel holds a hearing on the procurement providers for the 2025 elections on March 19, 2024.
St. Timothy Construction Corporation is among the three local partners of South Korea's Miru Systems. Their joint venture is tasked to deliver consequential election technology to the Philippines in 2025.
MANILA, Philippines – Documentary records of a local company that is part of the joint venture that won the biggest election contract for the 2025 midterms are ringing alarm bells among Philippine senators.
That firm is named St. Timothy Construction Corporation, which is among the three local partners of Miru Systems, the South Korean poll technology firm that will provide the Commission on Elections (Comelec) with 110,000 automated counting machines next year.
During a Senate electoral reforms panel hearing on Tuesday, March 19, chairperson Senator Imee Marcos said St. Timothy Construction Corporation’s license has expired, citing its records from the website of the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board.
She and Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel also questioned why a construction firm would be involved in the joint venture on deployment of election technology.
“In the articles of incorporation of St. Timothy, it is clear that its role is construction and general contracting,” Marcos said. “At no point is there anything in the primary purpose of the articles of incorporation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate that they would have anything to do with election exercises. Did they change that?”
A representative from Miru Systems said St. Timothy Construction Corporation will be a “financial supporter” in the joint venture.
Marcos, however, was also perplexed how assets supposedly reached P3.6 billion in 2022, from their capital of P14 million in 2014, based on documents she obtained.
“Clearly, there is a sudden infusion of money into the company immediately after the pandemic. My question is: Who infused this cash and why? Was it the alleged owner Ms. Rimando? And where did she get this money from, virtually overnight?” Marcos asked.
Senator Risa Hontiveros also questioned the ties of St. Timothy Construction Corporation to St. Gerrard Construction General Contractor & Development Corporation, a business that has been blacklisted by the Department of Public Works and Highways.
“The two companies also share a common incorporator – a certain Pacifico F. Discaya II. Was St. Timothy incorporated to circumvent the blacklisting of St. Gerrard?” Hontiveros asked in a privilege speech on Monday, March 18.
Marcos said St. Timothy Construction Corporation sent a representative to the hearing, but later “disappeared.” This meant no officer of the company answered the senators’ queries.
This prompted the panel to subpoena the company. This will compel the firm to face the senators in the next hearing that will be scheduled by Marcos’ committee.
The joint venture led by Miru secured next year’s most expensive poll contract worth P17.9 billion.
Miru, along with St. Timothy Construction Corporation, Centerpoint Solutions Technologies, and Integrated Computer Systems, will be tasked to provide the Comelec with ballot boxes, ballot paper, and canvassing system laptops and printers, on top of the new voting machines.
Miru’s technology was the subject of security concerns in countries abroad, but Miru insisted that allegations of election failures were false.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,481,South Korea to suspend licenses of 2 senior doctors in first punishments over walkout,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean authorities will suspend the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations, one of the doctors said Monday.
The impending suspensions are the first punishments against physicians after more than 90% of the country’s 13,000 doctors-in-training walked off the job last month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.
Officials say the recruitment plan is aimed at adding more doctors to prepare for South Korea’s rapidly aging population in a country whose doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country’s medical services.
In early March, the government began taking steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors after they refused its orders to return to work by the end of February. Police are separately investigating five senior members of the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, for allegedly inciting and abetting the strikes.
Park Myung-Ha, one of the five members, said he received a government-sent letter saying that his license will be suspended for three months starting April 15. Park, who works for the KMA’s emergency committee, said committee leader Kim Taek-woo was also given a three-month suspension.
The Health Ministry said it would not confirm any reported administrative steps imposed on individual doctors.
“My fellow doctors and I are really angered and appalled by the government’s measure,” Park told The Associated Press.
Park accused the government of attempting to break up the KMA emergency committee and sending a warning message to striking junior doctors. He said he and others are discussing legal steps to respond to the license suspensions.
About 12,000 junior doctors have been off the job for a month, but none has received a license suspension. Observers have said it would take a few months to suspend all their licenses and that the government would most likely end up suspending only strike leaders.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Their strikes have caused hundreds of canceled or postponed surgeries and other treatments, but officials say the country’s handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will most likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would severely burden South Korea’s medical services.
In a briefing earlier Monday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo urged senior doctors to cancel their plans and persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.
“Under any circumstances, you must not use the lives of the people for negotiations,” Park said.
In early February, the government said it would increase the country’s medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show a majority of the South Korean public supports the government’s recruitment plan. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.",2024-03-19 09:38:43,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News,481,south korea south suspend two senior allegedly medical hospital one said impending first 90 13000 job last month protest plan sharply increase medical school say recruitment plan prepare south rapidly aging population country whose ratio one world say cant handle abrupt steep increase would ultimately undermine medical early march government taking suspend striking junior return work end police separately investigating five senior medical association south korea allegedly one five said received letter saying license suspended three starting 15 park work emergency committee said committee leader kim also given health ministry said would confirm administrative individual fellow really measure park told associated accused government break emergency committee sending warning message striking junior said legal respond license 12000 junior job month none received license suspension said would take suspend government would likely end strike striking junior account le 10 south 140000 major represent 3040 senior dealing say handling emergency critical largely remains major university recently decided submit next week support junior still likely continue report work walk job would severely burden south medical briefing vice health minister park senior cancel persuade striking junior return must use people park early government said would increase medical school enrollment quota 2000 starting next year current cap 3058 unchanged since 2006officials say address shortage rural essential yet say newly would also try work capital region like plastic surgery dermatology say government plan would also result unnecessary due show majority south public recruitment plan say one south korea worrying possibility lower income future south korea suspend 2 senior first walkout
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,482,North Korea says Kim Jong Un supervised tests of rocket launchers targeting Seoul,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable “super-large” multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea’s capital as he vowed to strengthen his war deterrent in the face of deepening confrontations with rivals, state media said Tuesday.

The report came a day after South Korea and Japan said they detected North Korea firing multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward waters off its eastern coast, adding to a streak of weapons displays that have raised regional tensions.
Experts say North Korea’s large-sized artillery rockets blur the boundaries between artillery systems and ballistic missiles because they can create their own thrust and are guided during delivery. The North has described some of these systems, including the 600mm multiple rocket launchers that were tested Monday, as capable of delivering tactical nuclear warheads.
Photos published by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency showed at least six rockets being fired simultaneously from launch vehicles and flames and smoke blanketing what appeared to be a small island target.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said later Tuesday that it assesses North Korea conducted more launches than what was shown in the photos. Lt. Col. Lee Chang-hyun, a deputy JCS spokesperson, said that South Korea categorizes the North Korean weapons system tested Monday as a ballistic missile in view of its characteristics and capacities.
KCNA also said North Korean troops in a separate test simulated exploding an artillery shell at a preset altitude. The report did not specify whether that test was to rehearse how a nuclear weapon would be detonated over an enemy target.

Kim called the 600mm multiple rocket launchers key parts of his arsenal of weapons that are supposedly capable of destroying Seoul if another war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.
“(Kim) said that it is necessary to further impress upon the enemies that if an armed conflict and a war break out, they can never avoid disastrous consequences,” the KCNA said. He called for his army to “more thoroughly fulfill their missions to block and suppress the possibility of war with the constant perfect preparedness to collapse the capital of the enemy and the structure of its military forces.”
Lee, the South Korean deputy spokesperson, said South Korea and the United States have been bolstering their response capabilities against North Korea’s increasing nuclear threats.
North Korea’s launches came days after the end of the latest U.S.-South Korean combined military drills that the North portrays as an invasion rehearsal. It was unclear whether the North timed the launches with a visit to Seoul by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who on Monday attended a democracy summit and held talks with South Korean officials about the North Korean threat.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have risen since 2022, after Kim used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and updating their deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. assets.
There are concerns that North Korea could further dial up pressure in an election year in the U.S. and South Korea.
In a fiery speech to Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament in January, Kim declared that he was abandoning North Korea’s long-standing goal of reconciliation with the South and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to cement its war-divided rival as its most hostile adversary. He said the new charter must specify that North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.",2024-03-19 09:21:01,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News,482,south korea north leader kim un drill multiple rocket designed target south capital vowed strengthen war deterrent face deepening state medium said leader kim un observing western region artillery rocket salvo firing drill unconfirmed location north korea march 18 2024 report came day south korea japan said north korea firing multiple ballistic toward eastern coast streak raised regional say north artillery blur artillery ballistic create thrust delivery north 600mm multiple rocket tested capable tactical nuclear official central news agency least six fired simultaneously launch smoke blanketing small island joint staff said later north korea shown col lee deputy said south korea north system tested ballistic missile view also said north separate test artillery shell preset altitude report specify whether test rehearse nuclear weapon would enemy korea north system tested ballistic missile 600mm multiple rocket key arsenal supposedly capable another war said necessary impress upon armed conflict war break never avoid disastrous said army thoroughly fulfill block suppress possibility war constant perfect preparedness collapse capital enemy structure military south deputy said south korea united response north increasing nuclear came day end latest combined military north invasion rehearsal unclear whether north timed visit u secretary state democracy summit south north peninsula risen since 2022 kim used invasion distraction accelerate testing u south korea expanding combined training trilateral japan deterrence built around strategic u north korea could dial pressure election year u south fiery speech parliament kim declared north goal reconciliation south ordered constitution cement rival hostile adversary said new charter must specify north korea would annex subjugate south another war broke north korea kim un rocket
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,483,Kim Jong Un oversees 'super-large' rocket launcher firing drills,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a firing drill of super-large multiple rocket launcher systems, state media reported Tuesday. Photo by KCNA/UPI
SEOUL, March 19 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a firing drill of ""super-large multiple rocket launchers,"" state media reported Tuesday, an exercise that South Korea had described as a short-range ballistic missile launch a day earlier. The drill, held Monday in the west of the country, was ""aimed at proving the might and the real war capabilities of the weapon system through the sudden maneuvers and salvos of 600mm multiple rocket sub-units,"" state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. Advertisement
Images released by KCNA showed six batteries of rocket launchers firing simultaneously.
The United States and South Korea refer to the North's super-large multiple-launch rocket system as the KN-25 and analysts characterize it as a short-range ballistic missile. North Korea has claimed since October 2022 that the weapon can be fitted with a tactical nuclear warhead.
The exercises included hitting targets in the sea and simulating the midair detonation of a shell at a preset altitude, KCNA said.
Kim called the artillery units ""the main combatants and the mainstay of war to annihilate the enemy without hesitation,"" according to KCNA.
""The destructive offensive means possessed by our army should more thoroughly fulfill their missions to block and deter the risks of war with the constant perfect preparedness to destroy the capital of the enemy and the structure of its military forces,"" Kim said.

South Korea's military said Monday that it had detected the launch of multiple projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles. The missiles were fired from the Pyongyang area and traveled roughly 185 miles before landing in the East Sea, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
The launch came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Seoul for a democracy summit and followed days after the United States and South Korea wrapped up a large-scale joint military exercise.
The ballistic missile launch was the first by North Korea since Jan. 14, when it tested what it said was a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile.
Pyongyang has also fired several rounds of cruise missiles since the beginning of the year and has kept up a steady stream of threats and military exercises, including recent visits by leader Kim Jong Un to live-fire artillery drills and tank combat training.",2024-03-19 09:00:00,https://www.upi.com,UPI News,483,north leader kim un firing drill multiple rocket launcher state medium photo march 19 north leader kim un firing drill multiple rocket state medium exercise south korea ballistic missile launch day drill west country proving might real war weapon system sudden 600mm multiple rocket central news agency six rocket firing united south korea refer rocket system kn25 characterize ballistic missile north korea since 2022 weapon fitted tactical nuclear included sea detonation shell preset altitude artillery main mainstay war annihilate enemy without hesitation according destructive offensive possessed army thoroughly fulfill block deter war constant perfect preparedness destroy capital enemy structure military kim military said launch multiple ballistic fired area traveled roughly 185 landing east sea joint staff launch came u secretary state democracy summit day united south korea wrapped joint military ballistic missile launch first north korea since 14 tested said new ballistic also fired several cruise since beginning year kept steady stream military recent leader kim un artillery tank combat training kim un rocket launcher firing
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,485,The M.L.B. Season Opens in South Korea. Here’s What to Know.,"In the United States, many Major League Baseball games feature long periods of calm, punctuated by cheering when there’s action on the field or the stadium organ plays a catchy tune.
But in South Korea, a baseball game is a sustained sensory overload. Each player has a fight song, and cheering squads — including drummers and dancers who stand on platforms near the dugouts facing the spectators — ensure that there is near-constant chanting. Imagine being at a ballpark where every player, even a rookie, gets the star treatment.
“You should get ready to scream,” said Kim Seongjun, 26, a fan who attended an exhibition game in Seoul over the weekend. “It’s fun to get on your feet and cheer.”
Also, the food is on another level. Think of the ballpark as a giant buffet of Korean street food.

SEOUL, South Korea (KABC) -- The excitement is building as the Dodgers and Padres prepare to play MLB's first regular-season games in Seoul, South Korea.
The Dodgers beat South Korea's national team, 5-2 in their exhibition matchup Monday. For most fans around the world, Shohei Ohtani's debut in Dodger blue is the story to watch, but the amount of media attention surrounding the series and the players is quite unbelievable.
On Tuesday (in Seoul), the Dodgers held an optional workout, which gave some of the players some time to relax.
The team flew to Seoul last week and is doing all they can to get on a consistent clock. It wasn't easy following a 13-hour flight and a 16-hour time difference, and the Padres are on the same boat.
Dodgers right-hander Tyler Glasnow shared more about being named the Opening Day starter and his experience in Seoul so far.
""We got used to the time change and like, slept on the flight, and they gave us some pointers and all that stuff,"" he said. ""As far as like actual preparation, it's just normal. It's just like two extra days. It's been awesome. The atmosphere has been great. It's been very electric.""
Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Ohtani - ruled out this year as a pitcher after his second surgery on his right elbow - will soon start a throwing program that might allow him to play in the field this season.
""Shohei this year is primarily going to be the designated hitter,"" Roberts said. ""Once we get back to the States, he is going to start his throwing program, which he hasn't started yet, We'll see how that progression goes. If his arm is healthy enough, we'll have that conversation in the field. I do know he's not going to pitch this year.""
It's the first sign that Ohtani may do more than just DH after signing a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers. Of course, when he might play in the field is unclear - or if it happens at all.
The ""Seoul Series"" two-game set between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres will be broadcast on ESPN.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,488,South Korea suspends 2 doctors’ licences over walkouts,"SEOUL - South Korea has suspended the medical licences of two doctors, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) said on March 19, in the first punitive action over a month-long strike that has caused healthcare chaos.
Thousands of junior doctors stopped working on Feb 20 to protest against government reforms aimed at creating more medics to end shortages and deal with a rapidly ageing population, forcing hospitals to cancel crucial treatments and operations, including chemotherapy and caesarean sections.
The government has repeatedly urged doctors to return to their patients, warning of legal action for non-compliance, but the stand-off has spiralled, with senior doctors now threatening to join their junior colleagues and no serious talks under way.
Two officials from the KMA, which has been heavily involved in the walkout, were informed on March 18 that their licences had been suspended for three months, purportedly for instigating the strike.
“The two officials, Kim Taek-woo and Park Myung-ha, received the notice yesterday,” spokesperson Lee Seok-young told AFP.
A health ministry spokesperson told AFP that the government would not provide confirmation regarding the specific administrative actions taken against individual physicians.
The KMA has previously accused the government of using “intimidation tactics” to try to force doctors back to work, and said it was turning the country into a “totalitarian state”.
Under South Korean law, doctors are restricted from striking, and the government has requested police investigate people connected to the stoppage, including officials at the KMA.
“The government deeply regrets the current situation where even professors are considering resigning, following the footsteps of trainees,” Second Vice-Minister of Health Park Min-soo told reporters on March 19.
“Once again, the government is willing to talk to the medical community at any time without conditions,” he said, although Seoul has emphasised that abandoning the reform plan is not an option.
‘Save lives’
Seoul is pushing to admit 2,000 more students to medical schools annually from 2025 to address what it says is one of the lowest doctor-to-population ratios among developed nations.
Doctors say they fear the reform will erode the quality of service and medical education, but proponents of the plan accuse them of trying to safeguard their salaries and social status.
President Yoon Suk-yeol on March 19 said the reforms were necessary, and lamented the fierce opposition from physicians.",2024-03-19 05:30:00,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times,488,south korea suspended medical two medical association said march 19 first punitive action strike junior stopped working 20 protest government end deal rapidly population forcing cancel crucial chemotherapy government repeatedly return warning legal action noncompliance standoff senior threatening join junior serious heavily involved walkout informed march 18 suspended three two kim park received notice yesterday lee told health ministry told government would provide confirmation regarding specific administrative taken individual previously accused government intimidation tactic try force back work said turning country totalitarian south law restricted striking government police investigate people connected stoppage government deeply current situation even considering following second health park told march 19once government willing talk medical community time without said although reform plan pushing admit 2000 medical annually 2025 address one among say fear reform erode quality service medical education plan accuse trying safeguard social march 19 said necessary lamented fierce opposition south korea 2
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,489,Why MLB is hosting its first regular-season games in South Korea,"SEOUL — Watch the scene that stirred Monday afternoon here, and the homecoming that San Diego Padres shortstop Ha-Seong Kim cemented with a pair of home runs in his return to Gocheok Skydome, and it clicked. Said Padres manager Mike Shildt: “Can’t script it much better.”
The same goes for the club occupying the home dugout this week in Seoul. It’s been 30 years since Chan Ho Park debuted for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are in South Korea with a new traveling band of superstars that only added to the franchise’s appeal in the region. In spending more than $1 billion to acquire transcontinental superstars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, each born just a short flight away in Japan, the team has well established its place as the preeminent major-league club this side of the Pacific.
“These two teams are a perfect match,” Jeremiah Yolkut, Major League Baseball’s vice president of global events, told The Athletic ahead of the first MLB regular-season games ever in South Korea.
Yoshinobu Yamamoto is among the major attractions at the Seoul Series. (Yomiuri Shimbun / Associated Press)
The opening game starts Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Korea, or 6 a.m. ET in the United States. Here’s how the teams wound up here:
What does this mean for the teams?
A project that started in earnest three to four years ago couldn’t have lined up much better.
For the Padres, Kim gets to return to the same ballpark where he starred with the Korea Baseball Organization’s Kiwoom Heroes. It also marked a chance for free-agent signee Woo Suk Go to square off in exhibition action against the same LG Twins squad he closed out a KBO title with just last season.

For the Dodgers, there’s a global stage to launch one of their most highly anticipated seasons ever and a chance to tap further into a market that, as manager Dave Roberts put it, the organization wants to “paint blue.”
How did MLB settle on Korea?
As Major League Baseball charted out its next batch of international games following the ratification of the newest collective bargaining agreement, an obvious market emerged: Asia, where the league last opened a regular season in 2019 with a Seattle Mariners–Oakland Athletics series in Tokyo.
And while a return to Japan and its vast market share made sense — and appears to be in the cards again for 2025 — South Korea, and particularly Seoul, quickly emerged as a contender.
The city, and Gocheok Skydome, had previously partnered with the league to host part of the opening rounds of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, a test case to see if the city and facility had the proper infrastructure for potential future games. Additional work continued once the selection was finalized, including refurbishing the turf fields and ensuring enough clubhouse and weight room space to house full-fledged games.
“It’s just making sure we have everything as needed so that the Dodgers and Padres really wouldn’t know the difference between playing here and playing back in the States,” Yolkut said.
GO DEEPER How KBO insider Daniel Kim helped turn Korean baseball into a worldwide pandemic sensation
How is the Korea Series being received?
Tickets to South Korea’s first major-league regular-season games reportedly sold out within an hour. Ohtani’s Dodgers debut and Kim’s return to his home ballpark were too much to resist.
But the market’s overall viability and growth, the league hopes, will be spotlighted over the entire week, with Yolkut pointing to the exhibitions each team played against the Heroes, Twins and Team Korea over the past few days as an example.

When Heroes right-hander Ariel Jurado, who pitched parts of three seasons in the majors with the Texas Rangers and New York Mets, struck out Ohtani twice in his exhibition, he hoped scouts were able to watch. When Kiwoom third baseman Sung Mun Song drove a two-run double off the wall in his taste of major-league action, he called it “the best day ever of my life,” according to a live translation. Roberts raved about Dodgers scouts’ evaluation of Team Korea second baseman Hye Seong Kim, who could be on big-league teams’ radar as soon as this winter.
The hope, Yolkut said, is to use it as a potential jumping-off point for not just drawing attention to the games, but forming connections with the local fan base so they continue following Major League Baseball.
“We just need more and more appetite for baseball in this market both from a live event perspective and wanting us to be here, but also from merchandise sales, business sales and watching our games on the different platforms,” Yolkut said. “We can do that in this country. So it continues to be a market that’s burgeoning. A lot more, they want to be a part of it so we want to keep that relationship close.”
Will MLB play more games in Korea?
This will be a test case. But if the first few days in Seoul are any indication, it could be a market the league returns to as it cycles through international sites.
“As you could tell with the energy already we’re seeing in the market, the arrival at the airport, what we’re seeing around the city and people at the hotels, watching the players come in and out of the hotels, they just want more,” Yolkut said. “So I definitely think Korea will be in the running as we look at what the play plan will look like in the future.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,490,South Korea will suspend licenses of 2 senior doctors in first punishment for doctors' walkouts,"South Korean authorities will suspend the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations, one of the doctors said Monday.
The impending suspensions are the punishments against physicians after more than 90% of the country's 13,000 doctors-in-training walked off the job last month to protest the government's plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.
Officials say the recruitment plan is aimed at adding more doctors to prepare for South Korea's rapidly aging population in a country whose doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say schools can't handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country's medical services.
In early March, the government began taking steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors after they refused its orders to return to work by the end of February. Police are separately investigating five senior members of the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, for allegedly inciting and abetting the strikes.
Park Myung-Ha, one of the five members, said he received a government-sent letter saying that his license will be suspended for three months from April 15. Park, who works for the KMA's emergency committee, said committee leader Kim Taek-woo was also given a three-month suspension.
The Health Ministry said it wouldn't confirm any reported administrative steps imposed on individual doctors.
""My fellow doctors and I are really angered and appalled by the government's measure,"" Park told The Associated Press.
Park accused the government of attempting to break up the KMA emergency committee and sending a warning message to striking junior doctors. He said he and others are discussing legal steps to respond to the license suspensions.
About 12,000 junior doctors have been off the job for a month, but none has received a license suspension. Observers have said it would take a few months to suspend all their licenses and that the government would likely end up suspending only strike leaders.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea's 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Their strikes have caused hundreds of canceled or postponed surgeries and other treatments, but officials say the country's handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would burden South Korea's medical services severely.
In a briefing earlier Monday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo urged senior doctors to cancel their plans and persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.
""Under any circumstances, you must not use the lives of the people for negotiations,"" Park said.
In early February, the government said it would increase the country's medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show a majority of the South Korean public support the government's recruitment plan. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,492,Kim oversees 'super large' N Korea rocket launcher drills,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw firing drills involving ""newly-equipped super-large"" multiple rocket launchers, state media said, a day after Seoul said Pyongyang had fired several short-range ballistic missiles.
The United States and South Korea wrapped up one of their major annual joint military exercises last week, prompting angry retorts and live-fire drills from nuclear-armed Pyongyang, which condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion.
Seoul's military said yesterday it had detected the launch of ""multiple short-range ballistic missiles"" by the North, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the South Korean capital for talks.
The super-large multiple rocket launcher, referred to as KN-25 by the Seoul-Washington military, is a short-range ballistic missile, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (C) visiting a military training base in North Korea earlier this month
The North has claimed the weapon has the capability to be equipped with a tactical nuclear warhead.
Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Mr Kim guided the drills yesterday that tested the ""real war capabilities"" of 600 millimetre multiple rocket launchers as he stressed the importance of ""war preparations"".
The drills also involved simulating an aerial explosion of a shell from the super-large multiple rocket launcher at a predetermined altitude above the target, KNCA said.
Mr Kim said the multiple rocket launcher would help the North ""block and suppress the possibility of war with the constant perfect preparedness to collapse the capital of the enemy"".
During the drills, North Korean artillerymen ""demonstrated their excellent crack-shot artillery marksmanship and prompt and thorough combat readiness,"" it added.
""Massive shells of super-large multiple rocket launchers, which were fired from the sharp gun barrels like lava, flew to the target with the flame of annihilating the enemy,"" it said.
State media images showed Mr Kim, wearing his customary black leather jacket, watching the drills with his generals and celebrating their apparent success with a raised fist.
Pyongyang this month warned that Seoul and Washington would pay a ""dear price"" over their military exercises, and later announced that Mr Kim had guided an artillery unit it says was capable of striking the South Korean capital.
Mr Kim last week also oversaw paratroop drills aimed at showing his soldiers' ability to occupy an ""enemy region at a stroke"", according to state media.
Yesterday's ballistic missile test was the North's second this year, after Pyongyang launched one tipped with a manoeuvrable hypersonic warhead on 14 January.
So far this year, the nuclear-armed North has declared South Korea its ""principal enemy"", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over ""even 0.001 mm"" of territorial infringement.
Seoul is one of Washington's key regional allies, and the United States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South to help protect it against Pyongyang.
Last week's Washington-Seoul drills included ""clearing operations"" inside North Korea's ""key facilities"" in case of an attack by Pyongyang, according to Seoul's military.",2024-03-19 00:00:00,https://www.rte.ie,RTE.ie,492,north leader kim firing multiple rocket state medium said day said fired several ballistic united south korea wrapped one major annual joint military last week angry military said yesterday launch multiple ballistic north u secretary state south capital multiple rocket launcher kn25 military ballistic missile according south news leader kim c visiting military training base north korea north weapon capability tactical nuclear official central news agency said kim yesterday tested real war 600 multiple rocket importance war also involved aerial explosion shell multiple rocket launcher altitude target kim said multiple rocket launcher would help north block suppress possibility war constant perfect preparedness collapse capital north excellent artillery marksmanship prompt thorough combat readiness multiple rocket fired sharp gun like lava flew target flame enemy medium kim wearing customary black leather jacket watching apparent success raised month would pay dear price military later kim artillery unit capable striking south kim last week also paratroop showing ability occupy enemy region stroke according state ballistic missile test second year one tipped hypersonic 14 far year north declared south korea principal enemy reunification outreach war even 0001 territorial one key regional ally united 27000 south help protect included clearing inside north key case attack according military kim super large n korea rocket launcher

We're also seeing the team have a little fun on their trip! From enjoying the local street food to touring palaces. They are keeping us updated along the way.
It's all building up to this Wednesday when the Dodgers take on the Padres in the ""Seoul Series"" kick-off -- the first regular-season MLB games played in South Korea.
ABC7's Rob Fukuzaki arrived in South Korea and will be covering the sights and sounds of Seoul, as well as keeping a watch on Shohei Ohtani's anticipated Dodger debut against Manny Machado and the Padres.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,495,"South Korean Defense Chief Says North Korea Has Supplied 7,000 Containers of Munitions to Russia","North Korea has shipped around 7,000 containers filled with munitions and other military equipment to Russia since last year to help support its war in Ukraine, South Korea’s defense minister said Monday.
Shin Won-sik shared the assessment at a news conference hours after the South Korean and Japanese militaries said the North fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters, adding to a streak of weapons displays amid growing tensions with rivals.
Since the start of 2022, North Korea has used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up its weapons tests and has also aligned with Moscow over the conflict, as leader Kim Jong Un tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and join a united front against the United States.
U.S. and South Korean officials have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment in recent months to help fuel its war on Ukraine, saying that such arms transfers accelerated after a rare summit between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin in September.
North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and military assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s forces, according to South Korean officials and private experts. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.
During a news conference in Seoul, Shin said the South Korean military believes the North, after initially relying on ships, has been increasingly using its rail networks to send arms supplies to Russia through their land border.
In exchange for sending possibly several million artillery shells and other supplies, North Korea has received more than 9,000 Russian containers likely filled with aid, Shin said. He raised suspicions that Russia could be providing North Korea with fuel, possibly in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions that tightly cap the country’s imports of oil and petroleum products.
While fuel shortages likely forced North Korea to scale back winter training activities for its soldiers in recent years, South Korea’s military assesses that the North expanded such drills this January and February, Shin said.
North Korea’s latest missile launches came days after the end of the latest South Korean-U.S. combined military drills that the North portrays as an invasion rehearsal.
Shin said the North may dial up its testing activity before the April 10 parliamentary elections in South Korea, which is shaping up as a confidence vote for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a harder line than his liberal predecessor over North Korean nuclear ambitions and threats.
Animosity between the war-divided Koreans has recently worsened, with both countries taking steps to breach a 2018 bilateral military agreement on reducing border tensions. Kim vowed in January to abandon the North’s long-standing goal of reconciliation and to rewrite its constitution to declare the South its most hostile adversary.
While most of North Korea’s recent missile tests seem aligned with its stated goals of augmenting its frontline forces with new weapons systems, the South Korean and U.S. militaries are also evaluating whether some North Korean tests are aimed at verifying the performance of weapons it intends to send to Russia, Shin said.
North Korean state media said Monday that Kim sent a message of congratulations to Putin over his reelection as Russia’s president.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,496,"People Are Confused Why ""Jeff"" Is On A List Of Nuclear Superpowers","Since the creation of nuclear weapons, we have lived in a world where an all-out war could destroy humanity many times over.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,498,North Korea launches ballistic missiles during Blinken's visit to Seoul,"The missiles were interpreted as a calculated attempt to attract attention during the visit.
North Korea has condemned such exercises as rehearsals for invasion.
Blinken reaffirmed the US’s commitment to the ROK’s security after meeting Yoon.

On Monday, North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a move analysts interpreted as a calculated attempt to attract attention while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited South Korea for talks. Blinken, attending the third Summit for Democracy, met with President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul early Monday. He is also holding discussions with his South Korean counterpart on the sidelines of the event, with the focus now expected to be on the allies’ efforts to counter threats from the nuclear-armed North.
Last week, Washington and Seoul concluded one of their major annual joint military training exercises, leading to angry retorts and live-fire drills from nuclear-armed Pyongyang.
North Korea condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion. Seoul’s military reported that it had detected the launch of “multiple short-range ballistic missiles” early Monday. These missiles flew approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) before descending into the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan.
“We are closely sharing relevant information with the US and Japan and are maintaining utmost readiness,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff added.
Spokesperson Matthew Miller stated that after meeting Yoon, Blinken “condemned the launch of ballistic missiles by the DPRK and reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to the ROK’s security.” He referred to North and South Korea by their official names. Japan’s top government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi reported that the North had fired three short-range ballistic missiles, which landed outside of the country and did not cause any damage.
The launches occurred just days after Seoul and Washington concluded their annual Freedom Shield drills, which this year involved double the number of troops, ending on Thursday. Pyongyang issued a warning earlier this month, stating that Seoul and Washington would pay a “dear price” over the drills. Later, North Korean leader Kim Jong UN announced that he had guided an artillery unit capable of striking the South Korean capital.

“It’s a highly calculated move timing-wise by Pyongyang to fire multiple missiles to show they are capable of doing such an act even when the top US diplomat is in town,” Professor Choi Gi-il of military studies at Sangji University said.
Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies stated that North Korea typically stages missile launches “as a tit-for-tat” after US-South Korea joint drills. He mentioned that Blinken’s presence further motivates them, as it “means more attention from Washington and adds pressure on host Seoul.” Monday’s ballistic missile test marks the North’s second this year, following Pyongyang’s launch of one tipped with a maneuverable hypersonic warhead on January 14.
Blinken arrived in South Korea on Sunday afternoon ahead of the democracy summit, which runs from March 18 to 20 and will convene government officials, NGOs, and civil society members. Seoul, one of Washington’s key regional allies, hosts approximately 27,000 American soldiers stationed in the South to assist in protecting it against the nuclear-armed North. Conservative President Yoon has strengthened ties with Washington and aimed to reconcile with former colonial power Japan to enhance defenses against Pyongyang’s threats.
So far this year, Pyongyang has declared South Korea its “principal enemy,” disbanded agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and issued threats of war over “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,500,North Korea's Kim Hints Daughter Ju Ae Is Potential Successor,"North Korean state media has referred to Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's daughter using an honorific typically reserved for the country's leadership, which analysts say could suggest she's being groomed as her father's heir apparent.
The child, presumed to be named Ju Ae, was dubbed a ""great person of guidance"" in the Korean Central News Agency report on a commemoration ceremony for a new greenhouse complex on Friday.
If she someday ascends to the top spot, it will be the third hereditary transition since the death of North Korea's first supreme leader, Kim Il Sung, in 1994. He was replaced by son Kim Jong Il, who was succeeded upon his death in 2011 by Kim Jong Un.
Kim Ju Ae accompanied her father on the greenhouse visit in Kandong, the suburban county that houses the Kims' summer retreat.
""The great persons of guidance, together with cadres of the Party, the government, and the military, went round the complex,"" the report said.
It was the first time the term ""hyangdo,"" Korean for ""guidance,"" was used in reference to the younger Kim, whose first public appearance was at a missile launch in November 2022.
She has since been seen at her father's side at a number of military events, raising her profile and leading South Korea's spy chief Cho Tae-yong to call her Kim Jong Un's ""most likely successor.""
""This level of personal worship for Kim Ju Ae strongly suggests that she will succeed Kim Jong Un as the next leader of North Korea,"" Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Center for Korean Peninsula Strategy at the Sejong Institute, told Agence France-Presse.
1 of 2
Other North Korea watchers have pointed out there are multiple potential reasons driving the reclusive country's messaging on Ju Ae.
""Kim has ostentatiously elevated the status of his daughter, having her accompany him to high-profile events in what looks like an apprenticeship role. The variety of her appearances has expanded, and the formality of protocol, language and attire for her has increased,"" Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Seoul's Ewha Womans University, told the Straits Times.
""Pyongyang's propaganda department could be planning decades ahead, but it's probably more focused on the current leader's brand image while putting up smokescreens to obfuscate power dynamics in North Korean politics,"" Easley added.
The younger Kim is believed to be about 11 years old. The name Ju Ae was first made public in 2013 when former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who considers Kim Jong Un a friend, said he had met her and Kim's wife Ri Sol Ju on a visit to North Korea.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,501,"Russian arms deal is helping North Korean economy, Seoul says","South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said Monday that North Korea's economy is showing signs of improvement thanks to its arms deal with Russia. Photo by Thomas Maresca/UPI
SEOUL, March 18 (UPI) -- North Korea's sanctions-hit economy is showing signs of improvement thanks to an arms deal with Russia that is bringing back food and raw materials in exchange, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said Monday. ""The economic situation had been very poor, but since last year, the situation regarding food and fuel has improved significantly in return for the arms exports to Russia,"" Shin said during a briefing with international journalists in downtown Seoul. Advertisement
North Korea has shipped around 7,000 containers of munitions to Russia since July for use in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Shin said, updating a figure of 6,700 he had given reporters in late February.
Shin said in February that the containers likely held millions of 152 mm and 122 mm artillery rounds. Seoul and Washington have also said that North Korea is providing ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia.
Russia has sent more than 9,000 containers back to North Korea in return, Shin said, carrying food as well as raw materials used for producing munitions.
The defense minister suggested that Russia may also be providing North Korea with fuel in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions on imports of oil and refined petroleum products, noting an uptick in military exercises in recent months.

""Looking at North Korea's public [military] training, the overall trend had been a significant reduction in the past, but in January and February this year, there has been an unusual increase,"" Shin said. ""The rapid reduction in North Korea's training in the past was not only due to limited resources in other areas but especially due to the poor fuel situation.""
In recent weeks, North Korean state media has reported on leader Kim Jong Un overseeing live-fire artillery drills and tank combat training sessions.
The defense minister's remarks came hours after North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea, its latest provocation as tensions remain at their highest level in years on the Korean Peninsula.
The United States and South Korea have ramped up their military cooperation in response to the North's growing threats. Last week, the allies completed a large-scale joint military exercise, which Pyongyang condemned as preparation for an invasion.
Moscow and Pyongyang, meanwhile, have grown closer since Kim Jong Un made a rare visit to Russia in September. Along with food aid, Russia is believed to be supplying North Korea with advanced technology for its space and weapons programs.

SEOUL – South Korean authorities have suspended the licenses of two senior doctors for allegedly inciting the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations, one of the doctors said Monday.
The suspensions are the government’s first punitive steps against physicians after doctors-in-training walked off the job last month to protest the government’s plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.

Officials say the recruitment plan is aimed at adding more doctors to prepare for South Korea's rapidly aging population in a country whose doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world. But doctors say that schools can't handle an abrupt, steep increase in students, and that it would ultimately undermine the country's medical services.
In early March, the government began taking steps to suspend the licenses of striking junior doctors after they refused its orders to return to work by the end of February. Police are separately investigating five senior members of the Korean Medical Association, which represents doctors in South Korea, for allegedly inciting and abetting the strikes.
Park Myung-Ha, one of the five members, said he received a government-sent letter saying that his license will be suspended for three months from April 15. Park, who works for the KMA's emergency committee, said committee leader Kim Taek-woo was also given a three-month suspension.
The Health Ministry said it wouldn't confirm any reported administrative steps imposed on individual doctors.
“My fellow doctors and I are really angered and appalled by the government's measure,” Park told The Associated Press.
Park accused the government of attempting to break up the KMA emergency committee and sending a warning message to striking junior doctors. He said he and others are discussing legal steps to respond to the license suspensions.
About 12,000 junior doctors have been off the job for a month, but none has received a license suspension. Observers have said it would take a few months to suspend all their licenses and that the government would likely end up suspending only strike leaders.
The striking junior doctors account for less than 10% of South Korea’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals, they represent about 30%-40% of the doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training.
Their strikes have caused hundreds of canceled or postponed surgeries and other treatments, but officials say the country's handling of emergency and critical patients largely remains stable.
Senior doctors at major university hospitals recently decided to submit resignations next week in support of the junior doctors. Still, most of them will likely continue to report to work. If they walk off the job, that would burden South Korea's medical services severely.
In a briefing earlier Monday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo urged senior doctors to cancel their plans and persuade the striking junior doctors to return to work.
“Under any circumstances, you must not use the lives of the people for negotiations,” Park said.
In early February, the government said it would increase the country’s medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say that more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.
Surveys show a majority of the South Korean public support the government's recruitment plan. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.",2024-03-18 11:45:49,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit,502,file stage rally medical policy south korea march 3 2024 south suspended two senior allegedly medical hospital across country thats according one spoke associated press first punitive step job last month protest plan sharply increase medical school south suspended two senior allegedly medical hospital one said first punitive job last month protest plan sharply increase medical school say recruitment plan prepare south rapidly aging population country whose ratio one world say cant handle abrupt steep increase would ultimately undermine medical early march government taking suspend striking junior return work end police separately investigating five senior medical association south korea allegedly one five said received letter saying license suspended three 15 park work emergency committee said committee leader kim also given health ministry said wouldnt confirm administrative individual fellow really measure park told associated accused government break emergency committee sending warning message striking junior said legal respond license 12000 junior job month none received license suspension said would take suspend government would likely end strike striking junior account le 10 south 140000 major represent 3040 senior dealing say handling emergency critical largely remains major university recently decided submit next week support junior still likely continue report work walk job would burden south medical briefing vice health minister park senior cancel persuade striking junior return must use people park early government said would increase medical school enrollment quota 2000 starting next year current cap 3058 unchanged since 2006officials say address shortage rural essential yet say newly would also try work capital region like plastic surgery dermatology say government plan would also result unnecessary due show majority south public support recruitment plan say one south korea worrying possibility lower income future south korea 2 senior first punitive
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,503,North Korea fires ballistic missiles as US secretary of state Antony Blinken visits Seoul,"North Korea has launched ballistic missiles as US secretary of state Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul.
Three short-range ballistic missiles were fired into the sea on Monday, as Mr Blinken visited for a conference on advancing democracy.
It is the first time in two months that North Korea has launched weapons of that type.
South Korea said that several short-range missiles flew about 186 miles (300km) and landed off the North's east coast after being fired from the capital Pyongyang between 7.44am and 8.22am local time (around 11pm Sunday UK time).
The South condemned the launch as a ""clear provocation"" and said it was sharing information with the US and Japan.
Mr Blinken was among senior officials from around the world who were in South Korea attending the Summit for Democracy conference, which begins today. He will also meet his South Korea counterpart, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also condemned the launch after his country's coastguard reported the missile launch.
Calling the launch a violation of UN resolutions, Mr Kishida added: ""North Korea's series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable.""
Recent weeks have seen North Korea's military conducting exercises with conventional weapons - often overseen by dictator Kim Jong Un.

North Korea has shipped around 7,000 containers filled with munitions and other military equipment to Russia since last year to help support its war in Ukraine, South Korea’s defence minister said Monday.
Shin Won-sik shared the assessment at a news conference hours after the South Korean and Japanese militaries said the North fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters, adding to a streak of weapons displays amid growing tensions with rivals.
Since the start of 2022, North Korea has used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up its weapons tests and has also aligned with Moscow over the conflict, as leader Kim Jong-un tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and join a united front against the United States.
U.S. and South Korean officials have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other equipment in recent months to help fuel its war on Ukraine, saying that such arms transfers accelerated after a rare summit between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin in September.
North Korea in exchange possibly received badly needed food and economic aid and military assistance aimed at upgrading Kim’s forces, according to South Korean officials and private experts. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the existence of an arms deal between the countries.
During a news conference in Seoul, Shin said the South Korean military believes the North, after initially relying on ships, has been increasingly using its rail networks to send arms supplies to Russia through their land border.
In exchange for sending possibly several million artillery shells and other supplies, North Korea has received more than 9,000 Russian containers likely filled with aid, Shin said. He raised suspicions that Russia could be providing North Korea with fuel, possibly in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions that tightly cap the country’s imports of oil and petroleum products.
While fuel shortages likely forced North Korea to scale back winter training activities for its soldiers in recent years, South Korea’s military assesses that the North expanded such drills this January and February, Shin said.
North Korea’s latest missile launches came days after the end of the latest South Korean-U.S. combined military drills that the North portrays as an invasion rehearsal.
Shin said the North may dial up its testing activity before the April 10 parliamentary elections in South Korea, which is shaping up as a confidence vote for conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a harder line than his liberal predecessor over North Korean nuclear ambitions and threats.
Animosity between the war-divided Koreans has recently worsened, with both countries taking steps to breach a 2018 bilateral military agreement on reducing border tensions. Kim vowed in January to abandon the North’s long-standing goal of reconciliation and to rewrite its constitution to declare the South its most hostile adversary.
While most of North Korea’s recent missile tests seem aligned with its stated goals of augmenting its front line forces with new weapons systems, the South Korean and U.S. militaries are also evaluating whether some North Korean tests are aimed at verifying the performance of weapons it intends to send to Russia, Shin said.
North Korean state media said Monday that Kim sent a message of congratulations to Putin over his re-election as Russia’s president.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,506,5 Bold New Restaurants to Try in Brussels,"Brussels, long the realm of stuffy French restaurants packed with gray-flannel-suited diplomats, has suddenly gone bold and bright. Thanks to a crop of young chefs with iconoclastic ideas about flavor and sustainability, the city, in thrall to the rich sauces of Gaul for nearly two centuries, has emerged as one of the most exciting, and affordable, places to dine out in Europe right now.
These exciting talents are transforming the city’s old-fashioned bistros and cafes with spices from places like Korea, Latin America and Morocco, and “putting a vivid modern spin on homey local comfort food dishes,” explained Michel Verlinden, a Brussels food writer and restaurant critic for Le Vif, a major Belgian weekly. At the same time, they’re making the most of local produce like cabbage, carrots, endives and, bien sûr, brussels sprouts.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,507,Map Shows North Korea's Ballistic Missile Paths,"North Korea launched a salvo of suspected ballistic missiles off its east coast on Monday in a resumption of tests that coincided with the arrival in the South by the top U.S. diplomat.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected three short-range missiles launched from North Korea between 7:44 a.m and 8:22 a.m. local time, according to the Yonhap news agency. The projectiles all landed in the Sea of Japan, which is known in both Koreas as the East Sea.
""We strongly condemn North Korea's latest missile launch, which is a clear provocation that seriously threatens peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" Seoul's military said a statement.
Pyongyang's latest launches—its first known tests since firing a hypersonic warhead in mid-January—were also detected by Tokyo, which said the three missiles each traveled about 215 miles at an altitude of 30 miles before landing in the sea.
A Newsweek graphic based on data from Japan's Defense Ministry recreated the reported trajectories of the three launches on March 18.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the ballistic missile tests, which he said ""threaten the peace and security of our country, the region and the international community.""
Kishida called Kim Jong Un's latest show of force ""absolutely unacceptable,"" saying it violated U.N. Security Council resolutions banning North Korean missile tests.
In a brief statement, the Hawaii-based U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said it was ""consulting closely with our allies and partners,"" and that the event ""did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory.""
""The United States condemns these launches and calls on the DPRK to refrain from any further destabilizing acts,"" its statement said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's formal name.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are running high after a record number of missile tests by the North last year. The United States and allied forces from the South recently concluded their largest annual war games, which drew protests from Kim's regime for their pointed nature.
North Korea did not fire missiles during the U.S.-led Freedom Shield drills, but its state media released daily photographs of Kim personally leading field exercises including artillery firing, battle tank maneuvers and paratrooper training.
Experts say they expect Pyongyang to step up its military moves ahead of the U.S. elections in November in a bid to extract concessions from Washington. American officials believe Kim is likely to double-down on his strategic alignment with the Kremlin, which they say has already resulted in multiple weapons shipments to Russia for use in Ukraine.

Japan's NHK public television said Pyongyang's ballistic missile tests prompted a telephone call between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo as part of a new military hotline established last fall.
North Korea appeared to time the missile launches with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to the South. Blinken landed in Seoul on Sunday to kick off the third Summit for Democracy.
Blinken was scheduled to travel to Manila on Monday to ""underscore the United States' ironclad commitment to the U.S.-Philippine alliance,"" the State Department said in his public itinerary.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,510,Postcard from Korea: Padres’ Ha-Seong Kim shines in homecoming,"SEOUL — It was only an exhibition, a glorified scrimmage played on an elevated stage, but in some ways Monday marked the culmination of Ha-Seong Kim’s decade in professional baseball. Facing his first manager in the Korea Baseball Organization, playing in his former home stadium, the San Diego Padres shortstop hit two home runs and drove in four runs in a 5-4 win against the LG Twins.
“Can’t script it much better,” Padres manager Mike Shildt said.
“Some stuff,” second baseman Xander Bogaerts said, “is meant to line up.”
Over the past three seasons, Kim has emerged as perhaps San Diego’s most beloved player. Over the past few days in Seoul, Los Angeles Dodgers superstars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have drawn significantly more attention. A glance at the jersey-wearing fans that have flocked to Gocheok Sky Dome suggests that Kim’s close friend Jung Hoo Lee, even before his official debut for the San Francisco Giants, remains the most popular active major leaguer from South Korea.

Yet, as this country prepares to host its first MLB regular-season games, it is Kim who appears poised to serve as the emotional fulcrum of a historic series.
“You get to experience a lot of different personalities in this game … but now you’re putting yourself in his shoes here in his own country,” Padres third baseman Manny Machado said. “You can really appreciate the things he’s done and accomplished in the game. I mean, it’s not easy to do the things he’s done in the big leagues. But coming from here and doing it at the big-league level, not a lot of guys do it.”
🫰 AWESOME KIM 🫰 pic.twitter.com/V2kuV287ku — San Diego Padres (@Padres) March 18, 2024
Kim surprised some Korean baseball watchers when, in late 2020, he landed a four-year, $28 million contract from the Padres. Even as he struggled on offense in his first season stateside, he surprised everyone — including his new team — with the quality of his defense. He survived early tests against big-league pitching to surpass most expectations in 2023, the same year he became the first Asian-born infielder to win a Gold Glove Award. By now, much of the initial surprise has worn off.
What remains, according to those who have witnessed his ascent, is the energetic, understated man who quickly endeared himself inside the Padres’ clubhouse. Fernando Tatis Jr. last week commented on being impressed by South Korean culture: “People are swaggy here. They’re always dressing good.” Monday, Tatis described Kim as embodying the simultaneously organized and friendly vibes the outfielder picked up from walking through one of Seoul’s street markets.
“This guy is just a genuine person. He’s trying to be there for everybody, and he’s just a great guy all the way around,” Tatis said. “Kim is one of the best teammates that I have had, and I’m glad that I met him and we play baseball together.”

After starring in Monday’s exhibition, Kim described his two-homer performance as “lucky.” When a Korean reporter jokingly suggested he was lying, Kim pointed out he had enjoyed the advantage of facing the LG Twins’ pitchers in the past. He expressed his respect for Twins manager Kyoung-youb Youm, who managed Kim when the infielder was a KBO rookie.
“He’s the person that raised me to be who I am right now,” Kim said through interpreter David Lee.
In the Padres’ clubhouse afterward, multiple teammates expressed their happiness for Kim and the ovations he has received amid an already successful homecoming. Then the conversation turned to fashion; Kim has distinguished himself not only with his glove but also with his sense of style. Machado, who was recently spotted trying on “hanbok” — traditional Korean clothing — explained it was a gift from Kim.
Left fielder Jurickson Profar, meanwhile, was waiting for Kim to finish dressing after concluding his postgame media duties. The two friends were planning to go shopping in Seoul together. Profar said he agreed with Tatis’ assessment.
“I’ve been here, and I’ve been to Japan, too,” Profar said. “Japanese people and Koreans, they’re always swaggy.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,511,Shohei Ohtani to begin throwing progression when Dodgers return from South Korea,"SEOUL — Shohei Ohtani was always going to be a central figure this week, with his Los Angeles Dodgers debut set for Wednesday night against the San Diego Padres at Gocheok Skydome in Seoul, South Korea. Yet the more important development for the two-time MVP’s two-way future will come when the club returns this weekend to Los Angeles.
Ohtani, who will serve solely as a designated hitter in his first season after inking a record-setting 10-year, $700 million deal this winter, is set to start a throwing progression once the Dodgers return home, manager Dave Roberts confirmed Monday morning.
It’ll be Ohtani’s first time throwing a baseball since undergoing his second elbow ligament reconstruction surgery on Sept. 19. And while Roberts reaffirmed what he, Ohtani and Ohtani’s agent, Nez Balelo, have said throughout the spring — that Ohtani won’t pitch at all for the Dodgers in 2024 — it opens the door for the next stage of his fresh tenure with his new club.

That includes, Roberts said, the possibility of a conversation about Ohtani playing a position at some point, rendering the first base mitt and outfielder’s glove sitting in his locker this spring more than just ornaments.
“We’ll see how that progression goes,” Roberts said. “If his arm is healthy enough, we’ll have that conversation in the field. I do know he’s not gonna pitch this year. But right now, our only focus is him being a designated hitter.”
While Ohtani won’t pitch in major league games this year, there remains a chance he goes deep into his pitching rehab by season’s end. Dr. Neal ElAttrache, who performed both of Ohtani’s elbow procedures (including a 2018 Tommy John surgery), told the Associated Press this week that the 29-year-old had an “enhanced version” of Tommy John this time around that also included an internal brace — a braided suture to help support his new ligament — and that Ohtani is scheduled to start facing hitters in the last week of September and that all should go well.
“I think with Shohei, anything is possible,” Roberts said. “I hadn’t heard that one, but if that’s what Dr. Neal said, then he’s the expert.”
Ohtani originally said last month that he was hoping to begin a throwing progression while the Dodgers were in Arizona for spring training, but both he and the Dodgers have been willing to be patient with the timeline.
“Time is on our side in this one, especially if he’s not going to toe it up all year,” Balelo told The Athletic last month. “Why rush that?”
Ohtani’s one-way play has done little to quiet the excitement of his Dodgers arrival, much less with the club just a short flight from his native Japan as they open the 2024 season, with the Korean fan base — an athletic rival to Japan — embracing the global superstar and roaring at even the mere sight of him.

“I appreciate all the attention, obviously,” Ohtani said through interpreter Ippei Mizuhara as the club arrived Saturday. “Attention’s always great, being a baseball player and being able to play with these great guys next to me, I’m just really excited. I’m excited to be part of the team and prove to everyone that I’m actually a Dodger now.”

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,512,South Korea's Yoon warns of tech threat to democracy at summit,"South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Monday called fake news and disinformation based on AI and digital technology threats to democracy, as his country hosted a gathering of senior global officials including from Britain, the EU and the United States. Speaking at the opening of the Summit for Democracy, Yoon said countries had a duty to share experiences and wisdom so that artificial intelligence and technology could be employed to promote democracy.
Technological disparity among countries is a major challenge, Yoon said, describing it as a root case of how some countries fall behind in economic prosperity and fail to make progress on democracy. ""Fake news and disinformation based on artificial intelligence and digital technology not only violates individual freedom and human rights but also threatens democratic systems,"" Yoon said.
South Korea is hosting the third Summit for Democracy conference, an initiative
of U.S. President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms. Digital threats to democracy, and how technology can promote democracy and universal human rights, are expected to be the main agenda of the three-day meetings.
""As authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the summit
. Like-minded governments and their people are working together to promote free and fair elections, Blinken said, noting that safeguarding democracy was a collective effort.
Neither Blinken nor Yoon mentioned any countries or leaders by name. European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency Vera Jourova said 2024 is an election year around the globe and cited threats such as disinformation campaigns from the Kremlin among other actors.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations of spreading false or misleading information. Hours before the summit started, North Korea fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the sea for the first time in two months in its latest show of force.
The conference also kicked off just after Russian President Vladimir Putin was declared victor
in a record post-Soviet landslide in a presidential election on Sunday. The result means Putin, who rose to power in 1999, is set to start a new six-year term that will see him overtake Josef Stalin and become Russia's longest-serving leader in more than 200 years if he completes it.
A White House National Security Council spokesperson criticised the election and said they were ""obviously not free nor fair given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from running against him"". Putin told reporters he regarded Russia's election as democratic and said protests organised by supporters of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last month, against him had no effect on the election's outcome.
The summit is also being attended by British Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who said democracy faced threats on multiple fronts, including cyberattackers disrupting campaigns, populists embracing falsehoods, and ""autocrats holding sham elections."" Speaking at a separate session, Blinken said Washington was releasing the first guidance of its kind for tech companies to help prevent attacks on human rights defenders online.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,513,North Korea fires multiple ballistic missiles into sea as US-South Korea military drills conclude,"Follow us on Image Source : AP A TV screen in Seoul showing North Korea's ballistic missile launch on March 18.
Pyongyang: North Korea on Monday morning fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles as part of its renewed weapons test, according to its neighbours Japan and South Korea, raising tensions after the conclusion of US-South Korean military drills viewed by Pyongyang as an invasion rehearsal. The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month.
Experts predicted earlier that North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy. Japan's Defence Ministry said North Korea fired three missiles, two together at 7:44 am (local time) and the other about 37 minutes later.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that the North Korean missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, all outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone, and that no damage or injuries have been reported. Kishida denounced North Korea's ballistic missile tests as acts ""that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society"" and accused Pyongyang of violating UN Security Council resolutions.
South Korea's military said it also detected ""several"" suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning. The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launches ""clear provocation"" that threatened peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain readiness to repel any provocation by North Korea, based on its solid military alliance with the United States.
War preparations by North Korea
Meanwhile, the US State Department condemned the launches, saying they pose a threat to the North's neighbours and undermine regional security. A State Department statement said the US commitment to the defence of South Korea and Japan remains ""ironclad"".
It is important to mention here that North Korea fired the ballistic missiles as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy. North Korea's military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state's leader, Kim Jong Un.
The US stations a total of 80,000 troops in South Korea and Japan, the backbone of its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. During the South Korea-US joint military drills that ended on Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a series of military training exercises involving tanks, artillery guns and paratroopers and called for greater warfighting capabilities.
The 11-day South Korean-US drills involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last year. Although the North did not perform any missile tests during the period, it condemned the military drills and has been pushing hard to mount nuclear warheads on its missiles targeting the US mainland.
Many experts say North Korea already has nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching all of South Korea and Japan, but it has yet to have functioning long-range missiles that can strike the US mainland. Before Monday's launches, North Korea last carried out missile tests in mid-February by firing cruise missiles into the sea.
Tensions in the Korean Peninsula
North Korea's barrage of missile tests since 2022 has increased tensions in the Korean Peninsula, with several tests involving nuclear-capable missiles designed to attack South Korea and the US. The forces of the two allied countries have responded by expanding their training exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan.
Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons.
While North Korean cruise missile activities aren't directly banned under UN sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan. They are designed to be harder to detect by radar, and North Korea claims they are nuclear-capable and their range is up to 2,000 km, a distance that would include US military bases in Japan.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,514,"North Korea resume missile test days after South Korea, US end military drills","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Monday morning, its neighbors said, days after the end of the South Korean-U.S. military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.
The launches — North Korea’s first known missile testing activities in about a month — came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Seoul for a conference. Outside experts earlier predicted North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that the North Korean missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, all outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone, and that no damage or injuries have been reported.
Kishida denounced North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests as acts “that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society.” He said Japan strongly protested against North Korea over its testing activities, saying they violated U.N.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launches “clear provocation” that threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea will maintain readiness to repel any provocation by North Korea, based on its solid military alliance with the United States.
According to Japanese and South Korean assessments, the North Korean missiles fired from its capital region traveled a distance of 300-350 kilometers (about 185-220 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (about 30 miles).Observers say the missiles’ fight distances indicate they are weapons targeting major facilities in South Korea, such as its military headquarters in the central region.
The U.S. State Department condemned the launches, saying they pose a threat to the North’s neighbors and undermine regional security. A State Department statement said the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and Japan remain “ironclad.”

Worries about North Korean military moves have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country’s long-standing goal of seeking peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and to cement South Korea as its “invariable principal enemy.” He said the new charter must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.
Observers say North Korea may launch limited provocations along its tense border with South Korea. But they say the prospects for a full-scale attack by North Korea are dim as it would know its military is outmatched by the U.S. and South Korean forces.

Photo by Yonhap
SEOUL, March 17 (UPI) -- North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea on Monday morning, South Korean defense officials said, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Seoul for a multilateral democracy summit. The South Korean military detected multiple missiles fired from the Pyongyang area between 7:44 a.m and 8:22 a.m., the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters. Advertisement
The missiles landed in the East Sea after flying for about 185 miles, the JCS said.
""Our military immediately detected, tracked and monitored the North Korean missile launch and closely shared information with the U.S. and Japan,"" the message said. ""Our military will maintain the ability and readiness to respond overwhelmingly to any provocation while keeping a close eye on North Korea's activities under a solid South Korea-U.S. joint defense posture.""
Japan also announced that it detected the launch, with defense officials saying that three missiles were fired, each traveling more than 200 miles at a maximum altitude of around 30 miles.
The missiles landed in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone, Tokyo's Defense Ministry said.

The launch came after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Seoul earlier in the day for the Summit for Democracy, an initiative started by U.S. President Joe Biden in 2021.
South Korea is hosting the three-day event, which kicks off on Monday and brings together government representatives, NGOs and civil society groups for discussions on fostering democracy and combating authoritarianism.
Blinken is also scheduled to meet with his South Korean counterpart, Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, later on Monday.
The United States and South Korea wrapped up an 11-day large-scale joint training exercise on Thursday, which Pyongyang condemned as preparation for an invasion.
The ballistic missile launch was the first by North Korea since Jan. 14, when it tested what it said was a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,524,"North Korea resumes missile tests, raising tensions with its rivals after their military drills' end","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Monday morning, its neighbors said, days after the end of the South Korean-U.S.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Monday morning, its neighbors said, days after the end of the South Korean-U.S. military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal.
The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month. Outside experts earlier predicted North Korea would continue its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session that North Korea fired “a number of” ballistic missiles into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. He said the missiles fell outside of Japan’s exclusive economic zone and no damage or injuries has been reported.
Japan's Defense Ministry said North Korea fired three missiles, two together at 7:44 a.m. and the other about 37 minutes later. They all traveled a distance of 350 kilometers (about 220 miles) at the maximum speed of 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) per hour.
Kishida denounced North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests as acts “that threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international society.” He said Japan strongly protested against North Korea over its testing activities, saying they violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban the North from engaging in any ballistic activities.
South Korea’s military said it also detected “several” suspected short-range ballistic launches by North Korea on Monday morning. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said the South Korean military bolstered its surveillance posture and is closely coordinating with the United States and Japan.
During the South Korea-U.S. military drills that ended Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a series of military training exercises involving tanks, artillery guns and paratroopers. The 11-day South Korean-U.S. drills involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last year.
The North didn’t perform any missile tests during its rivals’ training, however. Its missile tests are considered much bigger provocations as North Korea has been pushing hard to mount nuclear warheads on its missiles targeting the U.S. mainland and its allies. Many experts say North Korea already has nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching all of South Korea and Japan, but it has yet to have functioning long-range missiles that can strike the U.S. mainland.
Before Monday’s launches, North Korea last carried out missile tests in mid-February by firing cruise missiles into the sea.
Animosities on the Korean Peninsula remain high in the wake of North Korea’s barrage of missile tests since 2022. Many of the tests involved nuclear-capable missiles designed to attack South Korea and the mainland U.S. The U.S. and South Korean forces have responded by expanding their training exercises.
This year, North Korea performed six rounds of missile tests before Monday’s launch.
Experts say North Korea likely believes a bigger weapons arsenal would increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the United States. They say North Korea would want to win extensive sanctions relief while maintaining its nuclear weapons.
Worries about North Korean military moves have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country’s long-standing goal of seeking peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and to cement South Korea as its “invariable principal enemy.” He said the new charter must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war broke out.
Observers say North Korea may launch limited provocations along its tense border with South Korea. But they say the prospects for a full-scale attack by North Korea are dim as it would know its military is outmatched by the U.S. and South Korean forces.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,528,North Korea fires ballistic missile as South hosts democracy conference,"SEOUL — North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea on Monday for the first time in two months, at a time when US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul to attend a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy.
South Korea’s military said the missile was fired to the east of the Korean peninsula.

Japan’s coast guard also reported the launch of what it said appeared to be a ballistic missile by North Korea and specified that it has already fallen.
Japan later said it detected what appeared to be a second ballistic missile launch by the North, also falling outside its exclusive economic zone area.
North Korea’s military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state’s leader Kim Jong Un.
The show of force by Pyongyang comes as the militaries of South Korea and the United States carried out large-scale annual joint military drills for 10 days ending last Thursday.
On Sunday, the South Korean military also mobilized marines, attack helicopters and amphibious assault vehicles in drills aimed at surging troop numbers to reinforce western islands near the sea border with North Korea, which had been bombed by the North in 2010.
Blinken is among senior officials from around the world attending the Summit for Democracy conference hosted by South Korea which opens on Monday. He will also meet his South Korean counterpart.
The summit is an initiative of US President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
At its last ballistic launch on Jan 14, North Korea fired what it said was an intermediate range hypersonic missile using solid fuel on to test new booster engines and a maneuverable warhead.
A month later, it launched multiple cruise missiles off its east coast including what it said was a new surface-to-sea missile in the latest of a series of such tests.",2024-03-18 01:09:13,https://nypost.com,New York Post,528,north korea fired ballistic missile sea first time two time u secretary state visiting attend conference president advancing military said missile fired east korea fired ballistic missile mar 18 via coast guard also launch said ballistic missile north korea already later said second ballistic missile launch north also falling outside exclusive economic zone military conventional recent often personally overseen isolated leader kim show force come south korea united carried annual joint military 10 day ending last south military also attack amphibious assault surging troop reinforce western near sea border north korea bombed north 2010blinken among senior around world summit democracy conference south korea also meet south summit initiative u president joe way stop democratic erosion last ballistic launch 14 north korea fired said intermediate range hypersonic missile solid fuel test new booster maneuverable month later multiple cruise east coast said new missile latest series north korea ballistic missile south democracy conference
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,529,North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Blinken visits Seoul,"North Korea fired ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday for the first time in two months, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for a conference hosted by President Yoon Suk Yeol on advancing democracy. South Korea's military said multiple short-range missiles were fired from a region south of the North's capital, Pyongyang, landing east of the Korean peninsula. It did not provide further details and said it was sharing information on the launch with the United States and Japan.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launches after his country's coast guard also reported the firing of what it said appeared to be a ballistic missile and specified that it had already ended its flight. Japan later said that it had detected what appeared to be a second ballistic missile launch by the North, and that both fell outside its exclusive economic zone area.
""North Korea's series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable,"" Kishida said, calling the launch a violation of U.N. resolutions. North Korea's military has been conducting exercises using conventional weapons in recent weeks, often personally overseen by the isolated state's leader, Kim Jong Un.
The show of force by Pyongyang comes just after the militaries of South Korea and the United States finished 10 days of large-scale annual joint military drills last Thursday. On Sunday, the South Korean military also mobilised marines, attack helicopters and amphibious assault vehicles in drills aimed at surging troop numbers to reinforce western islands near the sea border with North Korea. The North shelled the islands in 2010.
Blinken is among senior officials from around the world attending the Summit for Democracy conference, which opens on Monday. He will also meet his South Korean counterpart, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul. The summit is an initiative of U.S. President Joe Biden aimed at discussing ways to stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
In its last ballistic launch on Jan. 14, North Korea fired what it said was an intermediate range hypersonic missile using solid fuel on to test new booster engines and a manoeuvrable warhead. A month later, it launched multiple cruise missiles off its east coast, including what it said was a new anti-ship missile.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,539,North Korea Fires Ballistic Missile as Blinken Visits Seoul,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea fired at least one suspected ballistic missile in a defiant show of force that coincided with a visit to Seoul by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is taking part in a Summit for Democracy being held in the capital.
North Korea fired the missile toward waters off the east of the peninsula, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The missile appears to have already fallen, Japan’s Coast Guard said, adding later a second one may have also been launched and appears to have landed. National broadcaster NHK said both missiles likely splashed down outside of the country’s exclusive economic zone.
Further details were not immediately available. North Korea has often engaged in provocations designed to coincide with high-profile political events involving the US, South Korea and Japan.
This would be the second ballistic missile Kim Jong Un’s regime has fired this year after shooting off an intermediate-range rocket in mid-January designed to hit US bases in Asia. The state’s official media said that projectile was a “hypersonic"" missile, indicating it deployed a reentry vehicle for carrying a nuclear warhead that can change its flight path at high speeds.
Kim and his official media have been lashing out frequently at the US and South Korea, with the North Korean leader saying the time for peaceful unification is over and striking the concept from the country’s constitution.
Prior to the launch, Kim had guided military drills that included fire from an artillery unit capable of hitting Seoul, overseeing training that simulated storming a South Korean border guard post and jumping in the country’s newest tank to take it for a spin. These stepped up threats against his neighbor to the south that coincided with it holding joint military training with the US.

The US and South Korea concluded their annual Freedom Shield exercises on March 14, which included training on land, sea and in the air against contingencies posed by North Korea. Pyongyang has bristled for decades against joint drills, calling them a prelude to an invasion.
Kim said in February he has the legal right to annihilate South Korea. Kim has also shown no inclination that he wants to return to stalled nuclear disarmament talks and meanwhile has rolled out a series of new weapons designed to deliver nuclear strikes on the US and its allies in Asia.
This has led to some speculation that Kim has turned the corner on his bellicose outbursts and is readying for battle. US President Joe Biden has warned Kim that it would mean the end of his regime if he tried to launch a nuclear attack.

SEOUL, South Korea -- Shohei Ohtani may be South Korea's most-beloved Japanese athlete, a testament to his charm in softening any lingering animosity between the two neighbors.
Since his arrival in South Korea with his wife for the Major League Baseball opener on Wednesday against the San Diego Padres, the Dodgers superstar has been the focus of keen, special attention.
Many Korean fans are wearing Ohtani jerseys and rooting for him at the stadium. The Korean national team manager covets his autograph and myriad media reports and social media posts are praising him.
This is nothing new for the two-way baseball sensation, who in December signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers. But a Japanese receiving such a treatment in South Korea is extremely unusual, because of historical grievances stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
""Our social atmosphere has often made it difficult for us to openly say we like Japan,"" said Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Seoul's Hanyang University. ""I think Ohtani would perhaps be the first Japanese athlete who we can say we like. Maybe, some even consider him an honorary Korean citizen.""
Many of Ohtani's South Korean supporters say they like him because of what they call his good manners as well as his baseball excellence.
""Ohtani has been nice to Korean fans, so I think that's why everyone likes him,"" Park Sungjin, a 40-year-old physician wearing an Ohtani jersey, said before the Dodgers' exhibition game with South Korea's Kiwoom Heroes on Sunday.
The Dodgers and Shohei Ohtani posted photos on social media that showed the two-way Japanese superstar with his wife publicly for the first time.
""We have historical issues to be settled with Japan, but whether to like Ohtani is another matter,"" Hwang Seon-young, another Korean Othani fan, said at the Gocheok Sky Dome.
Ohtani, who is lauded in Japan as ""the perfect person,"" knows how to captivate Korean fans. Before his departure to South Korea, he posted an Instagram photo showing him making a ""finger heart"" gesture with a Korean national flag emoji.
After his arrival in South Korea, he told reporters that he's always respected South Korea's national teams and called South Korea ""one of my favorite countries.""
""The country that Ohtani likes the most is South Korea. The Japanese who South Koreans like the most is Ohtani,"" reads a Korean message posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Relations between South Korea and Japan have improved significantly since last year, with the South's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, taking a major step toward addressing disputes over Japan's colonial-era mobilization of forced Korean laborers - one of the long-running sticking points in improving bilateral ties.
In 2019, a forced-labor issue triggered widespread public campaigns in South Korea to boycott Japanese goods and services.
Ties between Korea and Japan have experienced on-again, off-again fluctuations. So if anti-Japan sentiments deepen in South Korea again like in 2019, Ohtani fans may feel a challenge in publicly expressing their likings of the 29-year-old.
But despite their often-rocky political relations, South Korea and Japan are closely linked to each other culturally and economically. Many younger South Koreans don't harbor the same strong resentment against Japan as their elders, and they often view Japanese athletes as just foreign athletes.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,543,Manager blasts Jesse Lingard for 'not working hard' after Nottingham Forest struggles,"Something went wrong, please try again later.
Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.
Something went wrong, please try again later.
Former Nottingham Forest attacker Jesse Lingard is said to have received a dressing down from his new manager.
Lingard now plies his trade for FC Seoul in South Korea. He joined the club last month after being without a team since he was released by the Reds last summer.
He has made three substitute appearances for Seoul so far. However, his most recent one apparently saw his effort levels brought into question.

Lingard came off the bench just before the hour mark of Saturday’s 2-0 win at home to Jeju United. But it seems he didn’t make a particularly positive impression during his time on the pitch.
The Daily Mail report boss Kim Gi-dong said afterwards: “Even though he came on as a substitute, he didn’t work hard and avoided tussle. The name value has no meaning on the pitch. I will tell him this exactly.""
Prior to his move to Seoul, Lingard had not played a competitive match since April 2023, when he was a late substitute in Forest’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. He made a total of 20 appearances and scored two goals during his season-long stay at the City Ground.
The 31-year-old recently said of his switch to the K-League: ""I've always wanted a different challenge and to create new memories in my career. I believe South Korea is the perfect place for that.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,544,Glastonbury’s first K-pop group is a reflection of years of Korean government strategy,"The 13-member K-pop boy band SEVENTEEN will make history this year as they become the first Korean group on the Glastonbury music festival lineup. While top Korean groups such as Blackpink and BTS have performed in the UK before, this will be the first time the K-pop genre has featured at the world famous festival, which is held on Worthy Farm in Somerset.
The booking marks a major milestone in the decades-long ambition of Korean creative industries to find success in the global entertainment market.
K-pop has reached new international heights over the past decade. Girl group Blackpink broke new ground this year when they joined Spotify’s “Billions Club” with their 2020 single How You Like That (2020), marking over one billion streams. The most famous K-pop band, BTS, are also “Billions Club” members, thanks to their songs Dynamite (2020) and Butter (2022).
The global success of K-Pop is the result of a clever cultural marketing strategy deployed by the Korean government in collaboration with the creative industries. This strategy has dovetailed with advances in the ease of access to cultural content via streaming services and social media, resulting in a global fan base in the hundreds of millions.
The history of K-pop’s success
It all began with the Korean government’s recognition of the economic potential of creative content in the 1990s. South Korea was looking for ways to recover from the ravages of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
Even as International Monetary Fund-imposed deregulation and liberalisation of the economy was rolled out in the 2000s, the government supported the film, television and music industries by maintaining a firm hand in the sector’s growth and export development. This included financial incentives for production companies and infrastructure development such as investment in high speed internet access across the country to support content production and consumption.
The strategy worked. The popularity of a steady stream of Korean television dramas began to grow in Japan and China. The Korean government then invested further in infrastructure to grow the industry and take Korean content beyond the region. Today, 60% of all Netflix subscribers have watched Korean content on the platform.
The success of Korean popular culture is felt across other areas of the economy too. K-pop and screen stars have struck brand deals with Korean companies, advertising items such as cosmetics, washing machines and smart phones to global audiences.
Korea’s cultural content market is now one of the largest in the world at around US$80 billion (£63 billion) in 2024, not far behind France and the UK. Its continuing growth is backed by a multi-pronged policy of financial investment, tax breaks and institutional support both in-country and via Korean culture centres in overseas cities. The government also provides financial incentives for cooperation between production companies and conglomerates such as LG and Samsung, which benefit from the success of Korean popular culture abroad.
The success of popular culture also lends itself to Korea’s public diplomacy. A concerted nation branding strategy implemented in the late 2000s and 2010s by the administration of Lee Myung-Bak administration aimed to push South Korea up the various nation branding indexes. Lee acknowledged the role that soft power could play in securing Korea’s position as a state with moderate global influence.
Since that time, K-Pop stars have come to play a role in Korea’s public diplomacy at forums including the UN and COP26.
No ordinary K-Pop band?
This is not to say that SEVENTEEN are mere cogs in a larger machine of Korean cultural content production and export. Unlike many other pop groups in their peer group, the members produce much of their own work, writing songs and raps and choreographing dance routines.
Unusually, SEVENTEEN is made up of a number of sub-groups. At times, these sub-groups record separately in order to showcase their respective skills across rap, dance and singing. As is typical of Korean cultural content, the band aims to create multiple moments of connection with audiences.
One example is the band’s reality TV series, Going SEVENTEEN, which is a mixture of games, challenges and behind the scenes clips, released weekly on YouTube and V Live, a Korean live streaming app for celebrity content.
As is also common in K-Pop bands, SEVENTEEN’s membership is made up of people from different countries including China and the US. This helps them connect with foreign fans and ensures there is always a member able to handle international media appearances in languages other than Korean.
UK-based fans will be thrilled their idols are making an appearance at Glastonbury, hopefully paving the way for more K-pop at international festivals in the future. It also perhaps shows that the festival industry is responding to the increasingly global music tastes of festival-goers, bringing new acts and genres onto their stages.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,545,Police Raid Korea Aerospace Office: 2 Engineers Accused Of Leaking KF-21 Fighter Jet Tech,"Summary Engineers have been suspected of leaking technology related to the KF-21 fighter jet.
The aircraft is not a stealth fighter but boasts advanced technologies as a regional option.
The leaks were reportedly discovered last month.
Police in South Korea raided offices belonging to Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) on Thursday after engineers were suspected of leaking technology related to the KF-21 fighter jet, Reuters reports. The raid lasted several hours, with a company spokesperson saying that KAI was cooperating with the police investigation. The fighter jet is a joint development between South Korea and Indonesia and is planned to become a homegrown fifth-generation fighter aircraft for the region.
The KF-21 had its first flight in 2022 and was promising to be a cheaper alternative to the US-built F-35. The KF-21 is not a stealth fighter. However, it does feature a complement of advanced technologies.
Discovery of the leaks
Leaks about the fighter jet were discovered last month when Indonesia’s foreign ministry said that it was gathering evidence into allegations involving two engineers in the program. Both Indonesia and South Korea have been working since 2001. Back then, the program included partners like Turkey, which later abandoned the program for their own fifth-generation fighter development.

The KF-21 was almost abandoned in a few instances. However, in 2010, the fighter jet received a renowned push for development due to an increase in threats from neighboring North Korea. The engineers themselves were part of the Indonesian design team. At the same time as Indonesia’s foreign ministry statement, the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) announced a joint investigation with the Defense Counterintelligence Command of South Korea.
The investigation started originally when an engineer was caught attempting to smuggle USB devices from the aircraft development center. The leaked documents contained sensitive information developed by KAI subcontractors who were exporting their technology to help the fighter’s development.
International partners in development
Lockheed Martin, the designer of the F-35, provided KAI with some insight into its design and technology. A deal between the United States and Korea would give the KAI technologies such as the AESA radar and electronic targeting pods that the F-35 utilizes for its situational awareness in combat.
Poland, the Philippines, and Peru have all expressed interest in the KF-21. After building six prototypes and undergoing testing, the aircraft is currently in low-rate initial production for adoption by 2026. When the aircraft enters service with the Republic of Korea Air Force, it will replace F-5E and F-4E aircraft in the Air Force inventory. Those aircraft have been in service since the 1970s. The Korean Air Force additionally operates the F-16C, a domestic variant of the F-15, as well as the F-35 itself.
Common leaks
Leaks are not unique to KAI. Lockheed Martin itself was the source of several leaks, most notably in 2013, compromising plans for the F-35. Back then, the US Pentagon said the theft of data was a serious problem for US adversaries.
Documents related to the Eurofighter Typhoon, another aircraft that helped inspire the KF-21, were involved in leaks recently. This time, classified documents detailing aircraft performance and operation were posted on a video game forum website. The same website has been the subject of multiple leaks for fighter jet aircraft technologies in recent years.",2024-03-17 05:34:31,https://simpleflying.com,Simple Flying,545,summary suspected technology related kf21 fighter aircraft stealth fighter advanced regional reportedly discovered last south korea belonging kai suspected technology related kf21 fighter jet raid several company saying kai police investigation fighter jet joint development south korea become fighter aircraft kf21 first flight 2022 promising alternative f35 kf21 stealth fighter however feature complement advanced fighter jet discovered last month foreign ministry said gathering evidence two program south korea working since 2001 back program included like turkey later abandoned program fighter trek kf21 almost abandoned however 2010 fighter jet received renowned push development due increase neighboring north korea part design team time foreign ministry statement south national intelligence service joint investigation defense counterintelligence command south investigation originally engineer caught smuggle aircraft development center sensitive information kai technology help martin designer f35 provided kai insight design technology deal united korea would give kai radar electronic f35 situational awareness expressed interest kf21 building six undergoing testing aircraft currently initial production adoption 2026 aircraft service republic korea air force replace f5e f4e aircraft air force inventory aircraft service since 1970s air force additionally f16c domestic variant f15 well f35 unique kai martin source several notably 2013 compromising f35 back u pentagon said theft data serious problem u related typhoon another aircraft inspire kf21 involved recently time classified aircraft performance operation posted video game forum subject multiple fighter jet aircraft recent police raid korea office 2 accused kf21 fighter jet tech

The Dodgers and Shohei Ohtani posted photos on social media that showed the two-way Japanese superstar with his wife publicly for the first time.
SEOUL, South Korea -- Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani says the upcoming Major League Baseball season opener against the San Diego Padres in Seoul will provide ""great memories"" for him and his wife, but he'll attempt to focus on baseball.
Ohtani spoke to journalists with Dodgers teammates at a packed press conference on Saturday, a day after he arrived here with his wife Mamiko Tanaka.
Ohtani said it was the first time for his wife ""to come with me to a game like this.""
""So I think it's going to be really great memories for both of us. But like I said earlier, I have one job to focus on. It's baseball,"" Otani said via an interpreter.
In late February, Ohtani, 29, said on Instagram that he was married to ""a normal Japanese woman"" he had known for three to four years. But he hadn't said who she was until another Instagram post with a photo of him and Tanaka on Thursday.
Tanaka, 27, is a former professional basketball player who played for the Fujitsu Red Wave in the Women's Japan Basketball League from 2019-23.
The Dodgers-Padres games on March 20-21 will be Ohtani's debut with the Dodgers, and they will be the first MLB regular season games in Seoul.
In December, Ohtani signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers. He underwent surgery on his right elbow last September and will not pitch this season. He will be used as a designated hitter and there is a possibility he could play in the field.
Ohtani says he is aware of the intense international media focus on the games in Seoul.
""I appreciate all the attention. Obviously, attention is always great, being a baseball player and being able to play with these great guys next to me. I'm really excited,"" Ohtani said, referring to his two teammates speaking at the news conference, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman.
The Dodgers have landed in South Korea ahead of their games against the Padres. The team is preparing to kick off the regular season next week with the highly-anticipated Seoul Series.
""I'm really used to the attention, but I just try to focus on what's in front of me, whatever it is.""
South Korean media have churned out stories on Ohtani, mostly in a positive tone, with social media filled with messages supporting and praising the Japanese phenomenon. Members of his fan club in South Korea put up placards welcoming Ohtani's arrival at Incheon international airport on Friday.
That's not an usual South Korean treatment of any celebrity from Japan, given the two countries' strong rivalry in sports and other areas mainly due to Japan's past colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
""Japan and Korea, they've always had a great rivalry when it comes to sports. I've always watched the games between Japan and Korea and I always respected, looked up to Team Korea and Korean players,"" Ohtani said.
""So being accepted like this and welcomed is a very good feeling. And I want to put on a very good show for everybody"" he said.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,549,Kim Jong Un rides in limousine gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin,"Kim Jong Un has taken a ride in a luxury black limousine gifted to him by Vladimir Putin.
The high-end motorcar is likely a token of appreciation from the Russian president for the purported million or more shells that North Korea has sold to Moscow.
Although both countries deny Pyongyang is supplying shells and missiles used in Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
Mr Kim was sent the Aurus Senat limousine in February after being shown the vehicle during a visit to Russia last year.
Observers said the shipment violated a United Nations resolution aimed at pressuring North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program by banning the supply of luxury items to the secretive nation.
""The special function of the private car is perfect and can be thoroughly trusted,"" Mr Kim's sister and senior official Kim Yo Jong said after it was used for the first time.
""Kim Jong Un's using of the private car sent by the president of the Russian Federation as a gift is a clear proof of (North Korea)-Russia friendship, which is developing in a comprehensive way on a new high stage.""

The accident on March 15 took place in Danyang, a popular paragliding spot with up to 20 vendors vying to offer tourists the experiential rides, local media reported.
The instructor in his 50s and the tourist in his 30s fell from a height of around 20m. They landed around 50m away from their intended landing point.
Both were taken to hospital. The instructor who suffered a cardiac arrest died while the tourist was being treated for serious injuries.
An employee of the paragliding experience centre reportedly told the police that strong winds caused one of the paraglider’s wings to fold, leading to the crash.
The police are investigating the circumstances that led to the accident.
Officials from the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s aviation and railway accident investigation committee also visited the site in Danyang, around three hours from Seoul by train.
Broadcast news video footage shows helmets, safety equipment and backpacks donned by the two men left in a heap on the ground. The video equipment used by the company to document the tourist’s experience was reportedly missing.
A police official said the paragliding vendor may face punitive action if it was found to be negligent in providing safety management.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,551,"Hyundai Mobis Unveils Electric Vehicle Solutions Elevating Electric Consumption Efficiency, Design, and Convenience","Maintains frontal grille design while minimizing air resistance, enhancing range by approximately 20 km
Overcomes the uniformity of electric vehicle designs, increasing marketability … Suitable for SUVs and CUVs
Automatic retrieval of the charger and closing of caps/covers … Aiming at electrification and autonomous driving with a ‘Total Solution’
SEOUL, South Korea, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Fierce global competition is accelerating the advent of the electric vehicle (EV) era by improving electric consumption efficiency (ECE). Alongside the fundamental challenge of enhancing battery performance, various other approaches are being explored continuously, with improvements in aerodynamic performance to reduce air resistance also gaining attention.
Hyundai Mobis (KRX 012330) announced on the 14th that it has developed an “Integrated Front Face Module” that maintains the traditional grille design while reducing air resistance and securing design diversity. The Front Face refers to the front part of the vehicle, where the lamps, grille, and hood are located.
Hyundai Mobis has incorporated various cutting-edge technologies into this integrated module, including an aerodynamic system that reduces air resistance and improves ECE. Notable features include a LiDAR that protrudes outward only during driving for design and sensor protection and an automatic charger retrieval feature that retrieves the charger after charging is completed.
This next-generation EV technology is being lauded as a pioneering example of enhancing performance, design, and convenience and constructing the vehicle’s front end as a total package.
A Triple Upgrade in Range Improvement, Design Marketability, and Charging Convenience
The most distinctive feature is a system that automatically opens and closes parts like the grille and hood, reducing air resistance during high-speed driving and improving ECE. This system, which allows the intake of external air and the exhaust of air after heat exchange, improves battery cooling efficiency, and controls the airflow. This combined aerodynamic system extends the electric vehicle’s range by approximately 20 km.
Electric vehicles typically adopt a streamlined design focused on reducing air resistance by eliminating the radiator grille, leading to a somewhat uniform appearance among passenger electric vehicles. Hyundai Mobis has differentiated itself by maintaining the traditional grille design while improving aerodynamic performance. Additionally, integrating design elements such as LED lighting has enhanced marketability. This technology is particularly beneficial for SUV and CUV electric vehicles, where lowering the vehicle height is challenging.
Technologies have also been applied to enhance design cohesion by preventing external contamination and impact on sensors. The LiDAR, hidden inside the grille when not in use, protrudes only during driving, achieving both LiDAR protection and an improvement in the front-end design marketability of the vehicle.
Another standout feature is the semi-automatic charging system. Simply plugging in the charger initiates the process, and after complete charging, the charger retrieval and the closing of the charging area’s cap/cover occur automatically. This feature reduces the inconvenience of users manually finishing during charging, presenting an alternative with better cost-effectiveness than charging robots.
Hyundai Mobis is reinventing itself as a ‘Mobility Solution Provider’ tailored to customers’ needs, focusing on future mobility core technologies represented by electrification, autonomous driving, and IVI. The company is intensifying its efforts to penetrate foreign markets and expand its order book, achieving USD 9.22 billion in orders from global automakers last year, accelerating its long-term growth strategy.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,552,"Superstar Ohtani excited with S. Korea fanfare, opening game","Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani said on Saturday he was excited to receive international attention and play in his first opening series in South Korea for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Ohtani arrived in Seoul on Friday for the opener Wednesday and Thursday against the San Diego Padres, drawing fanfare from a large crowd at Incheon International Airport. He will also play Korea Baseball Organization teams and Team Korea in exhibition games starting Sunday. ""I'm excited to play in Korea not just for baseball but to experience the whole culture,"" the Japanese pitching and hitting phenomenon told a press conference in Seoul.
His second trip to South Korea as a baseball player also prompted widespread Japanese media coverage. A national hero in his home country, Ohtani was part of Japan's under-18 team when it won the world championship in Seoul in 2012. He said South Korea was ""one of my favourite countries"" even back then and he was glad to return.
""Japan and Korea, they've always had a great rivalry when it comes to sports. I've always watched the games between Japan and Korea, and I always respected and looked up to Team Korea and the Korean players,"" he said. ""So being accepted like this and welcomed is a very good feeling, and I want to put on a really good show for everybody.""
Ohtani, who made a surprise announcement of his marriage and shared a photo of his wife just before flying to Seoul, said it was her first time travelling with him for a game. ""So I think it's going to be really great memories for both of us,"" he said. ""But like I said earlier, I have one job to focus on - so it's baseball.""
Ohtani, 29, won his second Most Valuable Player award last year after leading the American League with 44 home runs and notching 10 wins as a pitcher. In December, he signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers after six years with the cross-town Angels.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,554,The Deatles? The Sho-nas Brothers? Dodgers get a rock star arrival in Korea,"SEOUL, South Korea – Upon emerging from the 14-hour haze of their flight to Korea, the Los Angeles Dodgers stepped into a sea of flashbulbs at Incheon International Airport. The fans here camped out by the hundreds and did so for hours, rising to a stir for each of the baseball galácticos. They chanted Freddie Freeman’s name as if he were digging into the batter’s box at Dodger Stadium.
If the hordes of cameras and camped-out reporters in the parking lot this spring training were the appetizer, the Dodgers on Friday afternoon got their entree. The greeting was a slice of what they might expect during their season-long traveling tour.
A Korean fanbase roared for the franchise that debuted the first Korean-born big leaguer 30 years ago. And in a way, the franchise roared back, spending more than a billion dollars this winter on Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. The flurry was a full-throated pitch to become the preeminent Major League franchise this side of the Pacific.

For weeks, manager Dave Roberts has likened the media crush awaiting the Dodgers in Korea to the arrival of the Beatles.
Now the “Deatles” — or the “Sho-nas Brothers” — have their first tour stop at the Gocheok Skydome in Seoul, whether they’re ready or not.
“I think we’re kinda starting to get used to it a little bit, but I don’t know if anybody can get used to this like this,” Freeman said at a press conference on Saturday, when he joined his fellow MVP teammates Ohtani and Mookie Betts at the podium. As Freeman spoke, each word felt cut off by the endless chorus of shutters clicking on cameras.
Seoul, we have arrived. pic.twitter.com/0LSmoRLkvv — Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) March 15, 2024
The questions the Dodgers are facing here are hardly new. They’re just brighter, and louder, and there are more of them. For Freeman, the explanation is simple: the Dodgers had a heck of a winter, and that means more attention and more scrutiny.
“It’s been a lot,” Betts said, before repeating himself, “It’s been a lot.
“But, it’s cool. It’s kind of what comes when you get somebody like this,” he continued, pointing to the man to his right, Ohtani.
Much of the hype, of course, is tied to the club’s newest, biggest star.
When Ohtani’s interpreter Ippei Mizuhara emerged from the dugout during the club’s workout on Saturday, a mob followed, in hopes that Ohtani would be in tow. It turned out that he was. Ohtani quickly worked on his secondary leads before retreating back to the clubhouse.
Ohtani, of course, had made news of his own this weekend. In an Instagram post ahead of the club’s 14-hour flight, he completed a hard launch that led headlines in Japan: his new wife is Mamiko Tanaka, a former Japanese professional basketball player. When his new spouse came up during Saturday’s press conference, Ohtani’s cheeks turned blush red. Next to him, Betts and Freeman giggled with glee.

“I gotta hear this one,” Freeman said, reaching for the translating earpiece sitting in front of him. “C’mon Sho, don’t be shy.”
For as much as Ohtani claimed that he still isn’t used to the attention that has followed him since he was a teen, it’s safe to say he has had practice. As Roberts rolled through the club’s arduous flight, he perked up at a milestone for his new designated hitter. Roberts himself had only logged four hours of sleep. Center fielder James Outman had managed seven. “Shohei,” Roberts said, “slept 11 hours.”
So now Ohtani has plenty of rest and plenty of practice. The Dodgers’ newest frontman said “attention’s always great,” though his new teammates are seeing something different here.
“First time experiencing this,” free agent signing Teoscar Hernández said. “I think it’s gonna be fun. We have to try to enjoy it the best we can.”
It’s all they can do, really. The expectations have never been higher. The Sho is in town, and the club’s new reality will be cemented here against the San Diego Padres on Thursday, when Ohtani plays in his first regular season game.
“I’m just really excited,” Ohtani said through Mizuhara. “I’m excited to be part of the team and prove to everyone that I’m actually a Dodger now.”

SEOUL – North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used a Russian luxury limousine gifted by President Vladimir Putin, Kim’s sister said Saturday, praising the car’s “special function” and the two countries' deepening bilateral ties.
In February, Putin sent Kim a high-end Aurus Senat limousine, which he had shown to the North Korean leader when they met for a summit in Russia in September. Observers said the shipment violated a United Nations resolution aimed at pressuring the North to give up its nuclear weapons program by banning the supply of luxury items to North Korea.

In a statement carried by state media, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said that her brother used that limousine for the first time during an open event Friday.
“The special function of the private car is perfect and can be thoroughly trusted,” Kim Yo Jong said, without specifying. “Kim Jong Un’s using of the private car sent by the president of the Russian Federation as a gift is a clear proof of (North Korea)-Russia friendship, which is developing in a comprehensive way on a new high stage.""
According to Russian state media, Aurus was the first Russian luxury car brand, and it’s been used in motorcades of top officials since Putin first used an Aurus limousine during his inauguration ceremony in 2018.
Kim Jong Un, 40, possess a collection of foreign-made luxury cars believed to have been smuggled into his country. During his Russia visit, he traveled between meeting sites in a Maybach limousine that was brought with him on one of his special train carriages. Other limousines he's reportedly used include a Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman Guard and a Maybach S62.
Over the past year, North Korea and Russia have sharply boosted their military and other cooperation as they face separate confrontations with the West — North Korea for its advancing nuclear program and Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Drawing the biggest outside concerns was North Korea's purported shipments of conventional weapons to support Russia's war with Ukraine to receive high-tech Russian weapons technologies and other support.
Russia, together with China, have repeatedly blocked the United States and its partners' attempts to impose fresh U.N. sanctions on North Korea over its barrage of banned ballistic missile tests.
North Korea's state media separately reported Saturday that Kim Jong Un guided his troops conducting parachuting training the previous day. It's unclear if Friday's training was the same event in which Kim rode in the Russian limousine.
The parachuting training was the latest in a series of military drills that Kim has supervised in recent days, likely in response to the annual 11-day South Korean-U.S. military exercises that ended Thursday. Kim views his rivals’ exercises as an invasion rehearsal.
After watching Friday’s training, Kim ordered his military to conduct future training more intensively and make full preparation for a war, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency. Kim made similar demands after he guided other recent drills involving tanks, long-range artillery guns and combat soldiers.",2024-03-16 02:12:17,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit,557,file president right north leader kim un shake meeting outside city 200 125 city far eastern region russia sept 13 2023 kim used luxury limousine gifted recently sister said march 16 2024 praising special function two deepening bilateral kremlin pool photo via north leader kim un used luxury limousine gifted president sister said praising special function two deepening bilateral sent kim limousine shown north leader met summit russia said shipment united resolution north give nuclear program banning supply luxury north statement carried state medium sister senior official kim yo said brother used limousine first time open event special function private car perfect thoroughly kim yo said without kim private car sent president federation gift clear proof north friendship comprehensive way new high state medium first luxury car brand used top since first used limousine inauguration ceremony 2018kim un 40 posse collection luxury country russia visit traveled meeting limousine brought one special train reportedly used include s600 guard s62over past year north korea russia sharply military face separate west north korea advancing nuclear program russia invasion 2022 drawing biggest outside north conventional support war receive together china repeatedly blocked united impose fresh un north korea barrage ballistic missile state medium separately kim un training previous day unclear training event kim rode training latest series military kim recent day likely response annual 11day south military ended kim invasion watching training kim ordered military conduct future training intensively make full preparation war according official central news agency kim made similar recent artillery combat north kim luxury limousine gifted two expand

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,561,18-year-old soldier from West Virginia identified after he went missing during Korean War,"The remains of a 18-year-old soldier from West Virginia who fought in the Korean War have been found, more than seven decades after he went missing, a U.S. military agency announced on Friday.
U.S. Army Cpl. Ray K. Lilly, 18, of Matoaka, West Virginia, went missing while his unit was fighting on Nov. 2, 1950. His unit, L Company, 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division was fighting in Unsan, North Korea, when he disappeared. Several prisoners of war reported seeing Corporal Lilly at prisoner of war camp #5, but officials weren't able to determine his whereabouts.
U.S. Army Corporal Ray Lilly was accounted for 74 years after being reported missing while fighting in the Korean War. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA)
In 1953, North Korea handed over remains of service members to the United States. Among those returned was an unknown set of remains – designated as ""Unknown X-14682."" These remains were eventually buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.
In 2018, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), a military agency that aims to provide a full accounting for American missing personnel, announced a plan to disinter the remains of 652 unidentified service members from the Korean War. A year later the agency sent Unknown X-14682 to the lab for testing. Using dental records, anthropological analysis, mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence, investigators were able to determine in September of last year that the unknown remains were those of Corporal Lilly.
Lilly had died sometime in 1950 or 1951 while being held in a Korean prisoner of war camp, DPAA said. His family was notified and he will be buried in Princeton, West Virginia.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,563,"Korea, Japan, China Increase Animation Collaborations","Animation co-productions between Japanese media companies and their Asian counterparts were once few and far between, but in the past decade, with the rapid rise of animation industries in China and South Korea, the pace has picked up.
Indeed, FilMart is playing host to an animation panel March 13 that explored the advantages of cross-border collaboration.
Still, given the huge worldwide demand for animated IP, fueled by Netflix, Crunchyroll and other streamers, it could be faster. Industry observers have cited various barriers to Asian animation co-productions, including political, structural, legal and cultural issues.
In China especially, where the appetite for Japanese and other foreign animation once seemed unlimited, connections with the Japanese anime industry have become strained, if not severed.
One reason is a 2020 law aimed at protecting minors that bans anyone under 16 from owning a streaming account and prohibits audio-visual content with “obscenity, pornography, violence, cults, superstitions, gambling, inducements to suicide, terrorism, separatism or extremism” to anyone under 18.
“Not all anime is sex and violence, but a good half of modern productions are aimed a late-teen demographic sweet spot that is now forbidden in China,” said Jonathan Clements, author of “Anime: A History,” whose recently published second edition contains new chapters on the consumption, production and distribution of animation in China.
As a result of this content clampdown, Chinese media companies that were once eager to invest in Japanese animation are now more cautious. “They are well aware that if they pay out for the wrong sort of anime, their investment is worthless in the Chinese market,” said Clements.
By comparison, Korean media companies are more open to anime productions with Japanese counterparts, using Korean comics, web novels and webtoons to supply much of the content.
Meanwhile, the Japanese production committee system has long been a bottleneck for Chinese and Korean media companies. Typically comprised of Japanese entities with a stake in the project as investors or rights holders, production committees can be slow to make decisions and resistant to foreign participation. “In my experience, [the production committee] is often a terrifyingly tedious chicane of obstacles, particularly with old shows where things that you could once agree with a handshake and a whisky now have to be run past a group of disparate strangers,” said Clements.
But they also offer access to Japanese funding, including government money only available to projects with a Japanese production partner. “The ability to buy into the ‘ownership’ of a new anime while it is being made can save a canny investor hundreds of thousands of dollars at the distribution end,” Clements noted.

FAA to oversee SpaceX-led investigation into Starship mishap
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it will oversee a SpaceX-led investigation into a mishap involving both the booster and the Starship vehicle. SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight on its third try earlier on Thursday, making it much farther than before with a cruise through low orbit before being destroyed during a return to Earth.
SpaceX Starship disintegrates after completing most of third test flight
SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight through space on its third try on Thursday, getting farther than ever before, but disintegrated on its return to Earth. During a webcast of the flight, SpaceX commentators said mission control lost communication with Starship from two satellite systems simultaneously while the spacecraft was re-entering the planet's atmosphere at hypersonic speed.
South Korea scientists tout 'beef rice' as source of protein for the future
South Korean researchers have grown beef cells in rice grains in what they say is a major step towards achieving a sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly source of protein that could replace farmed cattle for meat. Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University in Seoul, who led the research published in the journal Matter this month, said the ""beef rice"" is the first product of its kind. It uses grain particles as the base for cultivating animal muscle and fat cells.
Antarctic scientists warn of bird flu spread as penguin cases confirmed
Scientists in Antarctica are warning of the spread of deadly H5N1 avian flu virus after the disease was first confirmed on the frozen continent's mainland last month and has since been detected in local penguin and cormorant populations. The spread of the virus, which has decimated bird populations worldwide and hit South American wild bird and marine mammal populations hard, has raised alarm about the potential impact on Antarctica's huge penguin colonies.

Study documents headaches experienced by astronauts in space
Research in the expanding field of space medicine has identified many ways in which a microgravity environment and other factors can meddle with the human body during space missions. A new study has added to the field by showing that astronauts are more likely to experience headaches in space than previously known. The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S., European and Japanese space agencies who traveled aboard the International Space Station for up to 26 weeks. All but two of them reported experiencing headaches in space.
Chemicals in plastics far more numerous than previous estimates, report says
At least 3,000 more chemicals are in plastics — from food packaging to toys to medical devices — than previously estimated by environmental agencies, a report published on Thursday found, raising questions over pollution and consumer safety. While the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had previously identified around 13,000 plastic chemicals, the report by a team of European scientists found more than 16,000 chemicals in plastics — a quarter of which are thought to be hazardous to human health and the environment.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,568,Photo Agencies Compare Royal Family to North Korea After Kate Editing Scandal,"The global news director of Agent France-Presse (AFP) has compared Kensington Palace to North Korea, stating it is no longer a “trusted source” of information after the revelations Kate Middleton Photoshopped her own picture.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4‘s The Media Show on Wednesday, Phil Chetwynd said that the royals are “absolutely not” a reliable source after the debacle.
“Like with anything, when you’re let down by a source the bar is raised,” Chetwynd told the radio show.
“We sent out notes to all our teams at the moment to be absolutely super more vigilant about the content coming across our desk. Even from what we would call trusted sources.”
Chetwynd noted how rare it is for agencies to kill photos adding that AFP was forced into the action after requests for the original photo were ignored.
“The previous kills have been from the North Korean news agency or the Iranian news agency, just to give you some background and context,” he adds.
The Associated Press (AP), which also withdrew the photo, today published a video entitled “How the Associated Press spots digital manipulation in photographs”.
AP photo editor Kiichiro Sato gives examples of previous photo withdrawals that came from pariah states North Korea and Cuba.
“We have to rely on handout photos from the government when we don’t have access,” says Sato.
The photo editor says that he blows up handout images to check for digital alterations and manipulations. In one example, AP pulled a photo of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un because a map on a table had been blurred.
In another case, a photo handed to AP of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro had been edited to remove Castro’s hearing aid, meaning the agency refused to circulate the altered picture.
Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day. C — The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) March 11, 2024
In a tweet signed by Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales said, “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.”
The admission from The Prince and Princess of Wales’ X account that the image was edited may have only come about because news agencies such as AFP issued the rare “kill” notice on the photo after it was apparent the photo had been manipulated.
However, the photo controversy has intensified speculation over Kate’s health and whereabouts.

RIVERSIDE, CA — A young Southern California soldier who died in a POW camp during the Korean War will finally be laid to rest Friday at Riverside National Cemetery, and a funeral procession is planned across the region.
U.S. Army Cpl. Daniel De Anda, a native of Pico, was a member of G Company, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, 8th U.S. Army. He was just 22 years old when he was reported missing in action on Nov. 30, 1950, after his unit tried to withdraw from Kunu-ri, North Korea, following the Battle of Ch’ongch’on. De Anda died a prisoner of war in March 1951.
Remains from the POW camp where De Anda was held were returned to the U.S. by North Korea in 1954. They were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu. One set of remains designated ""Unknown X-14598"" was among the ""war unknowns."" The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred Unknown X-14598 from Punchbowl in August 2019 to conduct laboratory analysis.
Using chest radiograph comparison as well as dental, anthropological and mitochondrial DNA analysis, De Anda was accounted for by the DPMAA on Jan. 10, 2023. De Anda's remains were brought to Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. On Friday, they will be transported to Riverside National Cemetery for a formal interment with military funeral honors.
A procession route is planned. ""We reach out to the community ... to ask your support lining the [procession] route with flags for this hero's journey to his final resting place,"" Honoring Our Fallen CEO Laura Herzog said.
The procession will depart Rose Hills Memorial Park around noon, entering the Pomona (60) Freeway eastbound. The motorcade will travel roughly 50 miles on the 60, passing through the city of Industry, Diamond Bar, Pomona, Chino, Ontario, Eastvale, Jurupa Valley, Riverside and the western fringe of Moreno Valley before turning southbound onto Interstate 215 and exiting on Van Buren Boulevard, where it will turn westbound back into Riverside, entering the national cemetery via Harmon Street — the main entrance.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,570,Squid Game' star found guilty of sexual misconduct,"South Korea's ""Squid Game"" actor O Yeong-su has been found guilty of sexual misconduct, a local court said Friday, after he was charged with assaulting a woman in 2017.
The 79-year-old in 2022 became the first South Korean to win a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor in a series for his performance as a seemingly vulnerable old man in the mega-hit Netflix dystopian thriller.
The actor was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years, the Seongnam Branch of the Suwon District Court told AFP.
He has been also ordered to complete 40 hours of classes on sexual violence, the court added.
The victim's own records of the assault and her claims are ""consistent ... and appear to be statements that cannot be made without actually experiencing them,"" judge Jeong Yeon-ju said, according to the court.
O was indicted in 2022 without detention on charges of sexually assaulting a woman, who has not been identified, on two occasions.
The incidents took place when O was staying in a rural area for a theatre performance in 2017, on a walking path and in front of the victim's residence, respectively, according to the Suwon District Court.
""Squid Game,"" a series that depicts a dark world where marginalized individuals are forced to compete in deadly versions of traditional children's games, quickly gained immense popularity on Netflix.
Within less than four weeks of its release in 2021, it attracted a staggering 111 million viewers.
The show's success has amplified South Korea's increasingly outsized influence on global popular culture, following global fame won by the likes of K-pop band BTS and the Oscar-winning film ""Parasite"".

Disgraced Yeong-su has received a suspended eight-month prison sentence and has been ordered to attend 40 hours of classes on sexual violence.
The majority of the hearings at the Seongnam Branch of the Suwon District Court were closed to the public.
But Judge Jeong Yeon-ju has since said that the victim's records of the assault were ""consistent...and appear to be statements that cannot be made without actually experiencing them"".
Yeong-su was charged in 2022 when an actress accused him of inappropriately touching her when the pair were on tour for a play, and again outside her house.
The actress has not been identified.
The actor has vehemently, and publicly, denied the allegations against him, insisting that he just held his alleged victim's hand.
At the time, Yeong-su said he had apologised to the woman, but added that it wasn't an admission of guilt.
""I just held her hand to guide the way around the lake,"" he told Korean news broadcaster JTBC.
""I apologized because [she] said she wouldn’t make a fuss about it but it doesn’t mean that I admit the charges.""
Just months before Yeong-su was charged, he became the first South Korean actor to win a Golden Globe and, in the same year, he was also nominated for an Emmy Award.
Squid Game fans seriously confused as Netflix drops first trailer for real life contest
Yeong-su was widely thought to be one of South Korea's most successful actors - until the charges against him.
South Korea's Ministry of Culture immediately pulled a government TV ad featuring Yeong-su off-air following the indictment.
He wasn't included in the cast for the second season of Squid Game, which remains Netflix's most-watched show of all time.
Anyone convicted of indecent assault in South Korea is subject to police monitoring - even after the completion of their prison term.
Since 2018, the MeToo movement in South Korea has been highlighting the prevalent climate of sexual harassment and abuse.
A wealth of allegations have emerged from the movement, bringing down some of the most powerful men in the country.
Executives in the K-Pop world have been accused of sexual exploitation and “pimping” girls out — while banning them from dating to keep their image squeaky-clean.
K-pop idol Baek Ji-young, 47, says she almost lost her career after her manager, Kim Shi-won, secretly recorded them having sex and then leaked the tape online when she attempted to change her contract.
She tried to sue him but he fled to Los Angeles, where he was jailed for having sex with a minor — which he also recorded.
Artists have also been embroiled in a string of sex scandals, including one known as the Burning Sun plot.
Police officials were arrested in the 2019 scandal in which women were drugged at nightclubs and offered to rich businessmen to rape.
Singer and TV host Jung Joon-young, 34, was jailed for five years for his part in the scandal, raping drunk unconscious women before posting footage to a chatroom.
Ex-Big Bang member Seungri was also involved and given 18 months for arranging prostitution for investors.

SEOUL, March 15 (UPI) -- U.S. and South Korean aircraft this week held a joint live-fire exercise focused on countering North Korean cruise missile and artillery threats, the South's Air Force said Friday. The five-day exercise began on Monday over the waters of the Yellow Sea and involved 40 aircraft including South Korean F-35A, F-15K, KF-16, F-16, FA-50 and F-4E jets. American A-10 and F-16 planes from the U.S. 7th Air Force, which is stationed in the country, also participated. Advertisement
""The training was conducted under a scenario of intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles launched by the enemy and precision striking the origin of the enemy's firepower provocation,"" the South Korean Air Force said in a press release.
The drills came in the wake of recent pointed threats from North Korea toward the South. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a long-range artillery firing exercise of units near the inter-Korean border that place the South Korean capital of Seoul within ""striking range.""
Kim also supervised the test of a new surface-to-sea cruise missile last month, as the North strengthens its defense posture near a contentious maritime border in the Yellow Sea.

On Thursday, state-run media reported that the North Korean leader drove a new battle tank during field exercises and called for preparations for ""actual combat.""
The allies' air drill coincided with their large-scale Freedom Shield joint exercise, which wrapped up on Thursday. The 11-day exercise focused on countering threats from the nuclear-armed North and included 48 joint field drills, almost twice as many as last year.
Pyongyang regularly condemns the joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills in the past as a pretext for its own missile tests.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,573,LCK Introduces Player Loan System Starting from 2024 Summer Split,"League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK), the organizer of the professional league for League of Legends esports in Korea, has announced the introduction of a player loan system starting from this year's summer split to enhance the league's competitiveness.
Riot Games, which conducts LoL esports in eight regions worldwide, has introduced loan systems in various regional leagues starting in 2024, and LCK has decided to align with the purpose and method of this introduction.
In implementing the loan system, LCK considered ways to positively impact both teams and players, aiming to elevate the overall competitiveness of the league while maintaining integrity.
Less experienced players will have the opportunity to secure playing time by being loaned to other teams, thus alleviating growth stagnation due to lack of experience and enhancing competitiveness. From a team perspective, loaning out players who have not been given playing opportunities allows for the assessment of their potential, and teams acquiring loaned players can expect short-term performance improvements by adding competitive players to their roster.
To loan a player, they must be registered on the team's roster. However, players cannot be loaned immediately after signing with a team; they must complete at least one split after the contract before becoming eligible. Additionally, a player who has been loaned out for two consecutive years must wait for one split before becoming eligible for loan again. Only direct player loans between two teams are allowed, and under no circumstances are third-party player loans permitted. Loaned players cannot be traded during the loan period.
Loans are only conducted within the same region. Players affiliated with the LCK roster cannot be loaned to foreign teams. Furthermore, loaned players are subject to restrictions on the number of matches they can play for the borrowing team based on their participation in the previous split. If a player participated in more than 50% of their team's total LCK matches in the previous split, they can only participate in LCK CL matches for the borrowing team. If a player participated in more than 50% of their team's total LCK CL matches in the previous split, they can only participate in LCK matches for the borrowing team. If a loaned player did not participate in any matches in the previous split, or if they participated in less than 50% of both their team's LCK and LCK CL matches, the borrowing team must choose whether to assign the player to either LCK or LCK CL for participation.
There is also a limit on the number of eligible players for loan. The combined total of players loaned out by a team and players loaned in by a team cannot exceed two. A team cannot loan out or loan in two players from the same team, and loans from the same team are limited to a maximum of one season. After the expiration of a one-season loan, a player cannot be loaned back to the same team. However, loans to different teams are allowed.
The loan period ranges from a minimum of one split to a maximum of one season. Loan applications and approvals are only possible during the off-season, after the team’s domestic and international tournaments are all over.
The loan system will be implemented starting from the 2024 summer split, and detailed information can be found in the rulebook.",2024-03-15 08:25:32,https://www.invenglobal.com,InvenGlobal,573,league korea organizer professional league league korea introduction player loan system starting summer split enhance eight loan various regional starting 2024 decided align purpose method loan system considered way positively impact aiming elevate overall competitiveness league experienced opportunity secure time thus growth stagnation due lack experience competitiveness team perspective given assessment potential expect performance competitive loan player must registered roster however immediately team must complete least one split contract becoming eligible additionally player two consecutive must wait one split becoming eligible loan direct player two player permitted loan within region roster foreign furthermore subject number play borrowing team based participation previous split player 50 total previous split participate borrowing team player 50 total previous split participate borrowing team player participate previous split le 50 borrowing team must choose whether assign player either also limit number eligible loan combined total team team exceed two team loan loan two team team limited maximum one season expiration loan player back team however different loan period minimum one split maximum one season loan possible domestic international loan system starting 2024 summer split detailed information found player loan system starting 2024 summer split

Look for Rob's live reports all week, starting Monday on Eyewitness News at 11 p.m.!
Here's what you need to know about the Dodgers in South Korea:
When is the Dodgers' opening day?
The Dodgers start the regular season against the San Diego Padres on March 20 when the division rivals face off in the first game of the Seoul Series. The series' second game will be played on March 21. Each game will be played at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul.
How to watch the Dodgers play in South Korea?
Games between the Dodgers and the Padres will be televised on ESPN and on SportsNet LA, the Dodgers' television home.
Here are the start times for Dodgers-Padres games:
Game 1: March 20 at 3:05 a.m. PDT
Game 2: March 21 at 3:05 a.m. PDT
The Dodgers will also play two exhibition games: against the Kiwoom Heroes of the Korea Baseball Organization on March 16 at 8 p.m. PDT, and against Team Korea on March 18 at 3 a.m. PDT. Both games will be televised on SportsNet LA.
Will Shohei Ohtani play in the Seoul Series?
Shoehi Ohtani is expected to make his Dodgers' regular-season debut in the Seoul Series after signing a 10-year, $700 million contract in December. He will be in the lineup as the team's designated hitter. The reigning AL MVP underwent right elbow surgery last September and will not pitch this season.
Ohtani and the Dodgers posted the first public photos of the two-way star and his wife, Japanese basketball star Mamiko Tanaka, as the team headed out to Seoul on March 14.
The Dodgers have landed in South Korea ahead of their games against the Padres. The team is preparing to kick off the regular season next week with the highly-anticipated Seoul Series.
Who will be pitching during the games in South Korea?
The Dodgers will have Santa Clarita native Tyler Glasnow pitch the first game against the Padres and Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start the second game.
Los Angeles traded for Glasnow during the offseason and the two sides agreed to a five-year, $136.5 million extension. Days later, the Dodgers added Yamamoto on a 12-year, $325 million deal.
For the Padres, Yu Darvish will start game 1 and Joe Musgrove will start game 2.
Who is part of the Dodgers' starting lineup?
The Dodgers will have Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani and Freddie Freeman - three former MVPs - at the top of their batting order. Betts, Ohtani and Freeman were among the best hitters last year and will be an intimidating trio for opposing pitchers.
Dodger fans will see other familiar faces in the starting lineup, most likely catcher Will Smith, third baseman Max Muncy and outfielder James Outman. The addition of outfielder Teoscar Hernández is expected to bring even more power to Los Angeles' lineup.
A big question going into the season will be whether Gavin Lux can hold down second base. Manager Dave Roberts switched Betts and Lux in the infield after Lux's defensive struggles at shortstop. Lux, who tore his right ACL last year, will now slide to second base and Betts will start at shortstop.
Jason Heyward, Chris Taylor and Kiké Hernández will have platoon roles heading into the season.
When is the Dodgers season home opener?
The first regular season game at Dodger Stadium will be on March 28 when the Dodgers face the St. Louis Cardinals.
Between the Seoul Series and the home opener, the Dodgers will play three spring training games against the Angels.
Have the Dodgers played internationally before?
The last time the Dodgers played on an international field was in 2018 against the Padres in Monterrey, Mexico. The team also played in Sydney, Austrailia in the 2014 season opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Before that, the Dodgers played in several exhibition games overseas, according to MLB.
Has MLB had international season openers before?
The Seoul Series will be the ninth time MLB has held a season opener outside of the U.S. and Canada. The first international season opener was in 1999 in Monterrey, Mexico between the Colorado Rockies and Padres.

FAA to oversee SpaceX-led investigation into Starship mishap
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday it will oversee a SpaceX-led investigation into a mishap involving both the booster and the Starship vehicle. SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight on its third try earlier on Thursday, making it much farther than before with a cruise through low orbit before being destroyed during a return to Earth.
SpaceX Starship disintegrates after completing most of third test flight
SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to eventually send astronauts to the moon and beyond, completed nearly an entire test flight through space on its third try on Thursday, getting farther than ever before, but disintegrated on its return to Earth. During a webcast of the flight, SpaceX commentators said mission control lost communication with Starship from two satellite systems simultaneously while the spacecraft was re-entering the planet's atmosphere at hypersonic speed.
South Korea scientists tout 'beef rice' as source of protein for the future
South Korean researchers have grown beef cells in rice grains in what they say is a major step towards achieving a sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly source of protein that could replace farmed cattle for meat. Professor Jinkee Hong of Yonsei University in Seoul, who led the research published in the journal Matter this month, said the ""beef rice"" is the first product of its kind. It uses grain particles as the base for cultivating animal muscle and fat cells.
Antarctic scientists warn of bird flu spread as penguin cases confirmed
Scientists in Antarctica are warning of the spread of deadly H5N1 avian flu virus after the disease was first confirmed on the frozen continent's mainland last month and has since been detected in local penguin and cormorant populations. The spread of the virus, which has decimated bird populations worldwide and hit South American wild bird and marine mammal populations hard, has raised alarm about the potential impact on Antarctica's huge penguin colonies.
China launch of DRO-A/B satellite on Wednesday not successful - state media
China's launch of a DRO-A/B satellite from Xichang satellite launch centre on Wednesday was not successful, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. The satellite did not enter the designated orbit, Xinhua said.
Study documents headaches experienced by astronauts in space
Research in the expanding field of space medicine has identified many ways in which a microgravity environment and other factors can meddle with the human body during space missions. A new study has added to the field by showing that astronauts are more likely to experience headaches in space than previously known. The study involved 24 astronauts from the U.S., European, and Japanese space agencies who traveled aboard the International Space Station for up to 26 weeks. All but two of them reported experiencing headaches in space.
Why did menopause evolve? New study of whales gives some clues
Menopause is a rare trait among Earth's species, known to exist in only a few. Humans are one. Killer whales and four other toothed whales are the others. New research examines menopause in these whales, with findings that may help explain why this phenomenon evolved, given that it is known in just six of the 6,000-plus mammal species living today. It might be titled: the tale of the Helpful Grandma Whale.
Chemicals in plastics far more numerous than previous estimates, report says
At least 3,000 more chemicals are in plastics — from food packaging to toys to medical devices — than previously estimated by environmental agencies, a report published on Thursday found, raising questions over pollution and consumer safety. While the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had previously identified around 13,000 plastic chemicals, the report by a team of European scientists found more than 16,000 chemicals in plastics — a quarter of which are thought to be hazardous to human health and the environment.
Japanese firm Space One's Kairos rocket explodes on inaugural flight
Kairos, a small, solid-fuel rocket made by Japan's Space One, exploded just seconds into its inaugural launch on Wednesday as the firm tried to become the first Japanese company to put a satellite in orbit. The setback for Space One and the rocket industry in Japan comes as the government and investors ramp up support for the sector amid a national security buildup and skyrocketing demand for commercial satellites.

North Korean-linked cyber hackers have laundered $13 million worth of ether this week through sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, data from blockchain analytics company Elliptic shows.
North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group funneled stolen crypto in 40 transcations into the virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash on March 13 and 14, according to research from Elliptic.
The laundered funds were part of the $100 million of cryptocurrency stolen from exchange HTX and its HECO cross-chain bridge in November 2023.
""Following common crypto-laundering patterns, the stolen tokens were immediately swapped for ETH, using decentralized exchanges. The stolen funds then lay dormant until yesterday, March 13, when the stolen crypto assets began to be sent through Tornado Cash,"" analysts said in a note.

Tornado Cash and similar mixers obscure funds by blending tokens from diverse sources before transferring them. The service was blacklisted by the US Department of the Treasury in August 2022. The department said the mixer had been used to launder more than $7 billion since it was created in 2019.
Shortly after the sanctions hit, Lazarus Group turned to Sinbad mixer to obscure its funds, but US authorities seized Sinbad in November, forcing Lazarus back to Tornado Cash.
Now, Tornado Cash keeps is up and running despite sanctions, as it operates on decentralized blockchains and smart contracts, putting it out of reach of authorities.
Lazarus Group has orchestrated hacks totaling over $3 billion in the last six years, per cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,578,"Meet Mamiko Tanaka, former Japanese pro basketball player and Shohei Ohtani’s wife","On the eve of his first road trip as a Los Angeles Dodger, Shohei Ohtani answered one mystery about himself: the identity of his wife, Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka.
Ohtani posted on Instagram on Thursday a picture of himself with Tanaka, alongside new Dodgers teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto and translator Ippei Mazuhara. The group was about to board a flight to Seoul, South Korea, where the Dodgers will open the regular season with a two-game series against the San Diego Padres.
“Can’t wait!” Ohtani wrote.
Ohtani has used his social media feed for several major announcements in recent months. He revealed his decision to join the Dodgers in December on Instagram. On Feb. 28, he announced his marriage. He described his wife as a “normal Japanese woman,” which was interpreted to mean that his spouse was not a celebrity. The two became engaged last year. Tanaka joined him at spring training this year in Arizona.
Tanaka, 27, played for the Fujitsu Red Wave of the Women’s Japan Basketball League from 2019 to 2023. Ohtani has said the relationship did not influence his decision to remain in Southern California after six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels.
“She has a great understanding of my profession,” Ohtani said. “She’s willing to be wherever I want to play at. Ultimately, it was up to me. So it had nothing to do with it.”

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,579,Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine picks ex-admiral as chief priest,"Japan's Yasukuni Shrine has picked a former military commander as its chief priest in a move that could stir controversy over a site that other Asian nations see as a symbol of Japan's wartime aggression. Umio Otsuka, 63, a former Maritime Self Defense Force (SDF) commander and a one-time ambassador to Djibouti, confirmed his appointment, which marks the first time since 1978 for an ex-military official to assume the post.
The last retired military officer appointed as chief priest, Nagayoshi Matsudaira, enshrined 14 prominent convicted war criminals alongside the 2.5 million war dead honoured at the shrine, including World War Two-era prime minister Hideki Tojo. ""I feel very honoured that the next stage of my life will be to serve this shrine for peace, where the spirits of those who gave their precious lives for the country are commemorated and honoured,"" Otsuka told Reuters.
A spokesperson for Yasukuni Shrine, whose name means ""peaceful country"" in Japanese, declined to confirm his appointment. Visits to the shrine by senior Japanese political figures have drawn criticism from countries such as South Korea, which was under Tokyo's colonial rule for 35 years, and China, which Japan invaded.
Conservatives assert that Yasukuni, which was established in 1869 as Japan emerged from more than 250 years of isolation, is meant to commemorate all the nation's war dead and is not a shrine dedicated to those blamed for waging war on Japan's neighbours. Otsuka's appointment comes as Tokyo and Seoul deepen security cooperation with each other and their shared ally, the United States, in response to escalating regional threats from China, Russia and North Korea.
No serving Japanese prime minister has visited the shrine since Shinzo Abe went in 2013, prompting an expression of disappointment by then-U.S. President Barrack Obama.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,580,South Korea sends scandal-hit ambassador to Australia,"However, analysts and government sources in Seoul said Mr Lee’s appointment should be viewed in the context of South Korea’s deepening defence relations with Australia. It is rare for Seoul to appoint a former minister to any diplomatic posting, let alone Canberra.
There are hopes President Yoon will visit Australia this year, although dates are unlikely to be discussed until after the April 10 parliamentary elections.
Anthony Albanese has not yet visited South Korea as prime minster, although Defence Minister Richard Marles went there last year, and Resources Minister Madeleine King travelled there in January.
The choice of envoy, said to be a personal pick by Mr Yoon, is the latest move by his government to prioritise relations with neighbour Japan and Australia as a hedge against a potentially, less-friendly US – its key ally – if Donald Trump were to win the November 5 presidential election.
Tensions are also rising on the Korean peninsula, with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un warning he is preparing for war, although Canberra does not believe an attack is imminent.
Australia is increasing its contributions to security on the Korean peninsula by taking part in multilateral defence exercises and contingency planning, said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.

“At the same time, Canberra provides some diplomatic cover for Seoul while relations with Beijing remain sensitive,” Mr Easley said.
“Australia’s foreign policy shows that standing up for stability in the Taiwan Strait and maritime security in Asia, and standing against economic coercion in the region, are not unilateral-led attempts to gang up on China, but rather common efforts for maintaining a rules-based order.”
Another key focus of the relationship is South Korea’s booming defence industry, of which Australia is a major customer.
In December, Korean company Hanwha won a $US2.4 billon ($3.65 billion) deal to build 129 infantry fighting vehicles for the Australian Army. The company is building a manufacturing facility in Geelong, and South Korean companies are also bidding for contracts to build naval frigates for Australia.
While President Yoon’s policies towards Australia are unlikely to be affected by April’s election, as he will retain power until 2027, his ruling conservative party is battling to hold on to enough parliamentary seats to maintain a majority and pass legislation.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,582,Baseball-MLB star Ohtani shares photo of wife as Dodgers head to South Korea,"Shohei Ohtani and his Los Angeles Dodgers side shared photographs of the Major League Baseball star's wife on social media for the first time on Friday, as the team boarded a plane to head to South Korea for the MLB season opener next week.
There has been widespread speculation over the marital status of Ohtani, the dual-threat MLB star and a national hero in Japan. The identify of his wife was a hot topic across Japanese print and social media on Friday after pictures emerged showing the couple together. Japanese media named the woman as Mamiko Tanaka, who played in Japan's Women's Basketball League.
Ohtani posted a photograph on Instagram posing with Tanaka in front of a plane with the message ""Can't wait!"" in Korean followed by the national flag of South Korea. Tanaka also appeared in a video posted on the team's X account as Dodgers players and family members boarded a plane.
Late last month, Ohtani announced his marriage to a Japanese woman on Instagram but gave no details about his bride besides her nationality. At a press conference the following day he described her simply as a ""normal Japanese woman"". ""Ohtani's wife"" was the top trending topic on X, formerly known as Twitter, in Japan, after the photos were posted. National broadcaster NHK and top daily newspapers put the photo of the couple at the top of their web pages.
The Dodgers will play Korea Baseball Organization teams before facing the San Diego Padres next week. The teams are due to arrive at Seoul's Incheon International airport later on Friday. Ohtani, 29, won his second Most Valuable Player award last year after leading the American League with 44 home runs and notching 10 wins as a pitcher.
In December, he signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers after six years with the Angels.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,583,This is what it’s like to live in North Korea’s firing line,"We are standing at a lookout where North Korean territory is faintly visible on the horizon. There is a distant thudding noise coming from somewhere out at sea, which Kim says is North Korean artillery fire. “Whenever I hear artillery fire, I get worried.”
Over the past week, North Korea’s reclusive leader has overseen military drills including simulations of storming border posts and demonstrations involving tanks. North Korean state media this week was full of images of Kim Jong-un surrounded by troops. Those drills came as the US and South Korea held annual joint military exercises of their own.
While Kim’s military posturing is nothing new for South Korea which has faced missile tests from the North for decades, the reclusive North Korean leader’s rhetoric is shifting. In January, he abandoned the doctrine of his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, and said Pyongyang would no longer seek peaceful reunification with Seoul. He described South Korea as a “hostile state” which needed to be annihilated.
While there are few in Seoul who believe Kim is suicidal enough to attack its more powerful neighbour, despite significant advances in his weapons capability in the past five years, security analysts say the change in language is evidence of a more confident dictator who has given up on negotiating with the West.

Diplomats and academics who met with AFR Weekend this week say South Korea is no longer up against an isolated and famine-ravaged regime, but a North Korea with powerful allies in Russia and China who share a common goal of destabilising the US-led world order.
“Ten to 15 years ago North Korea was an isolated regime, but today it is the dagger at the end of the bloc of authoritarian regimes, and it can do whatever it wants,” says Peter Lee, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a South Korean think tank.
“That makes it a far more dangerous threat to countries like South Korea and Japan, but also countries like Australia.”
Experts in Seoul who have been studying Kim and his family for decades say they are increasingly baffled by the unpredictable dictator’s motives. He is seen as less strategic and more prone to follow his ego than his father was. South Korea’s spy agency also believes he is grooming his 11-year-old daughter, Kim Ju Ae, as his successor. She is often seen accompanying him to military parades and missile tests.

At the same time, security experts warn he should not be underestimated, despite reports he is struggling to stem the flow of information about modern life in more affluent South Korea from his people.
Some believe the motivation for breaking with his grandfather’s principles by saying no unification for now and declaring that South Koreans are a different ethnic race instead of fellow countrymen is part of an effort to control the domestic narrative, which paints the North as a superior regime.
While Kim has historically sought to use his nuclear arsenal as leverage to negotiate sanctions relief, more recently his actions are seen to be driven by the shifting geopolitical landscape, where China and Russia are stepping up efforts to establish an alternative to the US-led world order.
“North Korean rhetoric and military exercises are telegraphing a potential kinetic provocation in the West Sea or against reconnaissance assets operating near its borders,” Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told AFR Weekend.
“Yet, North Korea is very unlikely to start a full-scale war when many of its soldiers are busy labouring on domestic construction projects, while Pyongyang is sending massive amounts of weapons to Russia, and as the US-South Korea alliance is strong.
“Instead, North Korea will attempt to politically divide its targets by raising tensions further during US and South Korean defence exercises and electoral campaigns.”
The heightened tensions in the region come ahead of South Korea’s legislative elections in April. While the polls will test President Yoon Suk-yeol’s authority, the outcome is unlikely to set back his efforts to deepen security ties with US allies such as Japan and Australia, or his more combative approach to manage North Korea’s sabre-rattling. Regardless of the election outcome, Yoon will remain in power until 2027.
The real game-changer, though, will be November’s US presidential elections. The very real possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House has many in Seoul worried.
Trump has warned the $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) that South Korea contributes to the cost of stationing US troops on the Korean Peninsula is not enough and wants an annual payment of $US5 billion. If Seoul refuses, Trump may threaten to pull its 28,500 US troops out. The Biden administration is now working to lock in a new agreement with Yoon’s government before the US election.

A former top Trump adviser, Alexander Gray, said in Tokyo this month that he did not believe the presidential candidate would abandon South Korea because it would not be in US interests. Not everyone is convinced, though.
“There is a lot of concern in Seoul about what a second Trump term might entail,” says the Asan Institute’s Lee. “That is partly because of how badly the country fared last time, but also because this alliance solidarity could become meaningless with a US administration that only cares about transactional bargaining.
“It would also put South Korea in a very vulnerable position vis-a-vis what overtures Mr Trump might send Kim Jong Un and his respect for leaders like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.”
Some of the residents on Yeonpyeong Island are also nervous about what Trump’s return to power means for the region.
“If Trump becomes president, it would not be good for South Korean national security. Trump is less concerned about South and North relations. Unlike Biden, Trump could just be a spectator if the North attacks the South,” Um Joo-sun, a 72-year-old retired construction engineer, says over coffee at the local bakery. “Me and my neighbours are living in constant fear about what will happen if the North attacks us.”
There are reminders everywhere on Yeonpyeong Island about Kim’s past attacks. The charred ruins of bombed-out houses in the middle of the main town have been turned into a museum charting attacks on the island in 1999, 2002 and 2010. Huge underground bunkers, some with hospital beds, power generators and rooms the size of a gymnasium, have been built into the sides of hills around town and can be occupied at any time.

Life here is a far cry from the world of K-pop, beauty salons and high-end department stores in Seoul. It is a quiet place with basic low-rise homes, many rebuilt after the 2010 attack, and rusting hulks of abandoned fishing vessels piled up on the shoreline. Most of the passengers on a ferry arriving from Seoul on the Saturday when the AFR Weekend visited were military personnel and their visiting families and girlfriends.
Like many frontier communities, the residents are faithful to their home and say they would not live anywhere else despite the island’s precarious position in geopolitics.

“Everywhere, there is the possibility of danger. Yes, we have been attacked, but this is our home and people make a living here. I don’t want people to see it as a war island,” says Kim Young-sun, 60, who works in the local observatory where tourists come to view North Korea from binoculars. Upstairs in the Island Cafe, a wall is covered with heart-shaped yellow and pink post-it notes full of messages from soldiers to their girlfriends and wives.
While she says she tries not to lose sleep about another attack, Kim believes the absence of Chinese fishing vessels in local waters since January is a worry. When they are present, the locals take it as a positive sign because they believe North Korea would alert China if its citizens were in danger.
Others, like tour guide Lee Myung-jae, 51, are still rattled by a 2010 artillery attack when she risked her life to run to the local school to find her then 10-year-old son.
“I was scared and had to hurry to protect my son. I was worried about my own safety too; I could have been killed,” she says.
In Seoul, the mood is more relaxed. While military service is compulsory for South Koreans, the country does not feel like it is on a war footing. Security analysts view the conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and potentially the South China Sea as more worrying.

Still, the shifting geopolitical tides and the uncertainty of a Trump presidency mean many are concerned. Two respected US analysts, former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker raised eyebrows in January when they published an article warning Kim had made a “strategic decision to go to war”. They estimate Kim has 50 to 60 nuclear warheads.
Some blame Yoon’s posturing and the West as much as Pyongyang for the heightened tensions.
“The ongoing power game between the US and China, coupled with the US’ strategic move to fortify its Indo-Pacific alliance on top of its NATO alliance to counter China, would worsen the tension and worsen the ongoing geopolitical tension across the world,” Yang Moo-jin, 63, president of the University of North Korean Studies, told AFR Weekend.
“One solution to defuse tension is for all stakeholders taking part in affairs with North Korea to adopt a balanced diplomatic approach and be willing to participate in an open dialogue, instead of instigating conflicts.

“I am very concerned that the tension in the Korean Peninsula would continue to escalate unless President Yoon Suk-yeol and Kim Jong-un take a step back and open up bilateral dialogue, while acknowledging each other’s interests.”
In its annual threat assessment, released this week, the US Intelligence Community concluded Kim hoped to use his closer ties with Russia to be accepted as a nuclear power.
“Today, it is pursuing stronger ties with China and Russia with the goal of increasing financial gains, diplomatic support, and defence co-operation. Kim almost certainly has no intentions of negotiating away his nuclear program, which he perceives to be a guarantor of regime security and national pride,” the report said.
It remains to be seen whether Trump will seek to reopen dialogue with Kim as he did with much fanfare during his last presidency. “Even if Trump returns to office, political reconciliation will be difficult while Kim looks to exploit cold war 2.0 geopolitics,” Easley says.
For the residents of Yeonpyeong Island, they are willing to hedge their bets, for now.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,584,Quality time with dogs increases the power of brain waves associated with relaxation,"Spending quality time with dogs reduces stress and increases the power of brain waves associated with relaxation and concentration, according to a study published on March 13, 2024 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Onyoo Yoo from Konkuk University, South Korea, and colleagues.
Animal-assisted interventions, like canine therapy, are widely used in hospitals, schools, and beyond to help reduce anxiety, relieve stress, and foster feelings of trust. Studies of the potential benefits of animal interactions often take a holistic approach, comparing people's mood or hormone levels before and after spending time with a service animal. But this approach doesn't differentiate between types of interactions, like grooming, feeding, or playing with an animal, limiting our understanding of how each specific interaction impacts a person's health and well-being. To better understand how such animal-related activities affect mood, Yoo and colleagues recruited a small sample of 30 adult participants to each perform eight different activities with a well-trained dog, such as playing with a hand-held toy, giving her treats, and taking pictures with her. Participants wore electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes to record electrical activity from the brain while they interacted with the dog, and they recorded their subjective emotional state immediately following each activity.
The relative strength of alpha-band oscillations in the brain increased while participants played with and walked the dog, reflecting a state of relaxed wakefulness. When grooming, gently massaging, or playing with the dog, relative beta-band oscillation strength increased, a boost typically linked to heightened concentration. Participants also reported feeling significantly less fatigued, depressed, and stressed after all dog-related activities.
While not all participants had pets of their own, their fondness for animals likely motivated their willingness to participate in the experiment, potentially biasing the results. Nonetheless, the authors state that the unique relationships between specific activities and their physiological effects could serve as a reference for programming targeted animal-assisted interventions in the future.
The authors add: ""This study provides valuable information for elucidating the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of animal-assisted interventions.""",2024-03-14 19:16:00,https://www.news-medical.net,News-Medical.net,584,spending quality time dog stress power brain associated relaxation concentration according study march 13 2024 journal one university south korea like canine therapy widely used beyond help reduce anxiety relieve stress foster trust potential animal often take holistic approach mood hormone spending time service animal approach doesnt differentiate like feeding animal limiting understanding specific interaction health better understand affect mood small sample 30 adult perform eight different dog toy giving taking wore electroencephalography record electrical activity brain dog subjective emotional state immediately following relative strength brain dog reflecting state relaxed wakefulness gently dog relative oscillation strength boost typically linked concentration also feeling significantly le depressed fondness likely willingness participate experiment potentially nonetheless state unique specific physiological effect could serve reference targeted add study valuable information therapeutic effect underlying quality time dog power brain associated relaxation

The World No. 18 Sen, who had finished runner-up at the 2022 edition, fought his way back from a 2-8 deficit in the decider after losing the second game to prevail 24-22 11-21 21-14 over Antonsen, a three-time medallist at the World championships, in a controversial second round match.
Earlier Sindhu, a double Olympic medallist, seemed to be in good touch as she fought hard against the world No. 1 An Se Young of Korea but failed to curb her mistakes to slip to a 19-21, 11-21 loss.

It was the Indian’s seventh successive loss to the indomitable An Se Young, who had become the first Korean woman singles player to win the World Championships last year.
Sen came into the match with a 1-3 record against Antonsen, who had defeated the Indian in all the last three meetings.
But the Indian produced a good show and was leading 17-15 in the first game after some close battles initially. With two winners, Antonsen made it 17-17 but Sen was the first to gain two game points with a precise backhand flick at the corner.
The Indian squandered five-game points as Antonsen stayed alive.
Eventually, at 22-22, two power-packed smashes gave Sen his fifth game point and he sealed it this time when the Dane sprayed wide.
After the change of ends, Antonsen was on top of things, leading 11-7 at the break. The Dane kept a firm hold on the rallies as Sen committed too many errors and the second game slipped away quickly.

At 14-16, Antonsen was called for a fault for touching the net, which rattled the Dane. “Fault? Why? Touched the net? My racket or body?”, an animated Antonsen could be heard saying to the chair umpire.
Sen soon unleashed a forehand winner to move to 16-14, which he swelled to 18-14 when a defensive shot went wide from Antonsen.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,588,"North Korea says Kim Jong Un test drove a new tank, urged troops to complete ""preparations for war""","Seoul, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un joined troops training on a new tank model and drove one himself, state media reported Thursday, as his rivals South Korea and the U.S. wrapped up their annual military exercises. It's the third time Kim was reported to have observed military exercises since the start of the 11-day South Korean-U.S. drills, which he views as rehearsals for an invasion.
The visits with troops are a less provocative response from Kim than missile tests, which North Korea has ramped up since 2022, along with its belligerent rhetoric this year.
At the tank drills Wednesday, Kim praised the country's latest tank as ""the world's most powerful"" and told his troops to bolster their ""fighting spirits"" and complete ""preparations for war,"" according to the official Korean Central News Agency. The other two drills he inspected recently were dedicated to artillery firing and maneuvering exercises.

The tank was first unveiled during a military parade in 2020, and its rolling during Wednesday's drill indicates that it's ready to be deployed, South Korean experts said.
Photos of the tank released by North Korea show it has a launch tube for missiles — a weapons system the former Soviet Union already operated in the 1970s. The new tank could pose a threat to South Korea, said Yang Uk, an analyst at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, but it remained unclear whether North Korea has the capacity to mass produce the machines.
The North's Defense Ministry last week threatened ""responsible military activities"" in reaction to the South Korea-U.S. military drills, which involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last spring. The U.S. and South Korea have been expanding their training exercises in a tit-for-tat response to the North's weapons testing spree.
Concerns about North Korea's military preparations have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country's long-standing goal to seek peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and cement South Korea as its ""invariable principal enemy."" He said the new constitution must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war breaks out.
Kim's moves signal ""North Korea's fundamental change on its South Korea policy, beyond just rhetoric,"" as the North's previous push for inter-Korean unity had allowed it to make a steadfast call for the removal of U.S. troops in South Korea, a senior South Korean presidential official told a small group of reporters Monday. He requested anonymity, citing the delicate nature of the issue.
Observers say Kim likely wants to use his upgraded weapons arsenal to win U.S. concessions like extensive relief of international sanctions on North Korea. They say North Korea is expected to extend its testing activities and ramp up warlike rhetoric this year as South Korea holds parliamentary elections in April and the U.S. a presidential election in November.
""The South Korean-U.S. training is over, but the North's isn't over yet,"" Yang said.

Photo courtesy of SLL/HighZium Studio
SEOUL, March 14 (UPI) -- Doctor Slump's Yeo Jeong-woo (Park Hyung-sik) seems to have it all -- he's a celebrity plastic surgeon with a successful practice and a massive social media following. But that perfect life comes tumbling down when a mishap during a surgical procedure leaves a patient dead. The once high-flying Jeong-woo suddenly finds himself saddled with debt, facing criminal charges and suffering from symptoms of PTSD. Advertisement
To make matters worse, he is thrust into an unwelcome reunion with his high school academic rival when he moves into a shabby rooftop apartment above Nam Ha-neul (Park Shin-hye).
Ha-neul, it turns out, is in a slump herself. Once on her way to a bright future as an anesthesiologist, her career has been derailed by an abusive boss and a clinical diagnosis of depression.
It's not exactly a classic setup for a romantic comedy, but Doctor Slump finds laughter and a love connection between characters who have fallen from grace. The series, produced by South Korean studio SLL, has struck a chord with audiences at home and abroad with its spotlight on the country's grueling work culture and cutthroat academic environment.

""I found that a lot of viewers were able to relate to the topics of the drama, which are slump and burnout,"" Park Hyung-sik told UPI.
Doctor Slump has topped the South Korean television charts since it premiered in late January and has been a fixture on Netflix's global Top 10 list.
Park Hyung-sik, a certified heartthrob whose credits include The Heirs, High Society, Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth, Strong Girl Bong-soon and Suits, said he was drawn to Doctor Slump for the way it addressed serious themes in ""an in-depth and entertaining way.""
The 32-year-old actor and singer said he could also relate to the challenges the characters face.
""There are times when I want to drop everything,"" he said. ""But I try not to let it consume me. I think I've done a good job of pulling myself together and focusing on something else as soon as I sense that.""
In Doctor Slump, the reunion of Jeong-woo and Ha-neul gets off to a rocky start, as both are instantly transported back to the intensity of their high school rivalry. In flashbacks, we see Ha-neul chugging packets of powdered coffee to fuel marathon study sessions, while Jeong-woo turns everything into a competition, from solving math equations at the chalkboard to simply walking to class.
Advertisement
But -- in classic Korean rom-com fashion -- the former enemies slowly turn into lovers as they bond over their shared misery. (A courtroom crime drama is a subplot, as Jeong-woo tries to figure out who is framing him for the operating room mishap.)
""I kept postponing everything and worked like a dog,"" Ha-neul says at one point. ""But look at me now. I slaved away and only ended up with depression.""
They find that stepping off the treadmill of high achievement gives them a chance to experience the simple pleasures in life that they never had time to enjoy -- like karaoke sessions, long walks under falling cherry blossoms and heartfelt conversations over countless bottles of soju.
""Let's take a break while we're at rock bottom,"" Jeong-woo says.
Doctor Slump's strongest appeal is undoubtedly the chemistry of its leads, who are among the most popular and prolific stars in South Korea. Their on-screen pairing also parallels a real-life reunion, as the two are working together for the first time since starring in The Heirs a decade ago.
""It felt familiar and new at the same time,"" Park Hyung-sik said. ""It was the first time we'd worked together for a long period, so it was new, but we quickly got in sync.""
Advertisement
And even when the tone is light and romantic, the series never lets go of its grounding in real-life problems -- including a straightforward portrayal of treating mental health challenges, which still carry a stigma in South Korea.
""Just as we see a doctor when we're injured or sick, I hope visiting a doctor for our mental illnesses is considered natural and this series will help it,"" he said.

There’s an article in the Korean Ajunews , titled:A rough translation of the report claims that this is possible after changes to the Mobile Device Distribution Improvement Act, aiming to lower household communication costs.Changing mobile carriers (number portability) in South Korea now comes with the potential to receive an additional support of up to 500,000 KRW (South Korean won; 500,000 KRW are approximately $380) on top of “regular” subsidies. Until not so long ago, there was a cap for such “regular” subsidies (applied when purchasing a device through national carriers), but it was recently lifted Prior to the change, the government capped carrier subsidies at 240,000 KRW (~$180). Mobile carriers in South Korea are now alluring users with subsidies between 55,000 KRW ($42) and 500,000 KRW for a newdevice and a mobile plan.The biggest change is, of course, the provision of transition support funds. Korean carriers could now pay up to 500,000 KRW in transition support funds covering cancellation fees, SIM card issuance costs, and loss of long-term subscription benefits when changing rival plans.Considering this, if one were to port their number and purchase a, they could receive support totaling up to 1.15 million KRW in these new funds: “regular” subsidies and “transition” subsidies. Notably, some mobile retailers are offering additional, even higher subsidies at 15% of the carrier's, thus making in to 1.15 million KRW in total support. Since the basemodel is priced at 1.155 million KRW, it could essentially become a 'free phone'.Kim Hong-il, Chairman of the Korea Communications Commission, emphasized that these amendments aim to reduce the financial burden on consumers and encourage a more competitive market. However, whether this will invigorate true competition remains uncertain, as carriers show hesitance towards heavy subsidy investments.",2024-03-14 12:27:14,https://www.phonearena.com,PhoneArena,592,number portability south korea cap regular carrier phone cap start price galaxy s24 1155 million amount s24galaxy s24galaxy s24recommended article rough translation report possible mobile device distribution improvement act aiming lower household communication mobile number portability south korea come potential receive additional support 500000 south 500000 approximately 380 top regular long ago cap regular applied device national recently prior change government capped carrier 240000 180 mobile south korea alluring 55000 42 500000 mobile biggest change course provision transition support fund could pay 500000 transition support fund covering cancellation card issuance loss subscription rival one port number purchase could receive support 115 million new fund regular transition notably mobile offering additional even higher 15 thus making 115 million total support since priced 1155 million could essentially become free chairman korea commission aim reduce financial burden encourage competitive market however whether invigorate true competition remains uncertain show hesitance towards heavy subsidy galaxy s24 free new subsidy could make possible

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,594,South Korea scientists tout cultured ‘beef rice’ as source of protein for the future,"SEOUL – South Korean researchers have grown beef cells in rice grains in what they say is a major step towards achieving a sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly source of protein that could replace farmed cattle for meat.
Professor Hong Jin-kee of Yonsei University in Seoul, who led the research published in the journal Matter this month, said the “beef rice” is the first product of its kind. It uses grain particles as the base for cultivating animal muscle and fat cells.
In the research, rice grains were treated with enzymes to create an optimal environment for cell growth, then infused with bovine cells that are cultivated to achieve the final hybrid product, which resembles a pinkish grain of rice.
The beef rice contains approximately 8 per cent more protein and 7 per cent more fat than conventional rice. Prof Hong noted the protein is 18 per cent animal-based, making it a rich source of essential amino acids.
The Yonsei team is not the first to work on lab-grown meat products. Companies around the world have launched cultivated meat; one of the latest involves plant-based chicken and eel cultivated from a soy base, marketed in Singapore.
Prof Hong’s team said rice has an advantage in terms of safety relative to soy or nuts because fewer people are allergic to it.
“If successfully developed into food products, cultured beef rice could serve as a sustainable protein source, particularly in environments where traditional livestock farming is impractical,” he said.
Priced at about US$2 (S$2.70) per kilogram, and with a far smaller carbon footprint than traditional beef products, cultured beef rice could compete on grocery shelves, Prof Hong said.
He said challenges remain from a technical standpoint and in terms of winning over customers with flavour and texture.
Diner Keum Dong-kyu, who recently sampled the rice beef at a Korean barbecue restaurant in Seoul, said the idea is innovative.
“But honestly, I don’t think it can replicate the juiciness or texture of real beef.”
Germany tourist Christian Krammel, who was more positive, said: “Now, it does not compare to beef yet, but as I see the research is in early stages, I would say it’s a great way forward.” REUTERS",2024-03-14 11:45:00,https://www.straitstimes.com,The Straits Times,594,south grown beef rice say major step towards sustainable affordable environmentally friendly source protein could replace cattle hong university led research journal matter month said beef rice first product kind grain base animal muscle fat research rice create optimal environment cell growth bovine cultivated achieve final hybrid product pinkish grain beef rice approximately 8 per cent protein 7 per cent fat conventional rice prof hong noted protein 18 per cent making rich source essential amino team first work meat around world cultivated meat one latest chicken eel cultivated soy base team said rice advantage safety relative soy people allergic successfully food cultured beef rice could serve sustainable protein source particularly traditional livestock farming impractical us2 s270 per kilogram far smaller carbon footprint traditional beef cultured beef rice could compete grocery prof hong said remain technical standpoint winning flavour recently rice beef barbecue restaurant said idea honestly dont think replicate juiciness texture real tourist positive said compare beef yet see research early would say great way forward south korea tout cultured beef rice source protein future
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,595,"North Korea’s Kim Jong-un test drives new tank, orders troops to prepare for war","Open this photo in gallery: A military demonstration involving tank units is held in North Korea, on March 13.KCNA/Reuters
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un joined troops training on a new model of tank and drove one himself, state media reported Thursday, as his rivals South Korea and the U.S. wrapped up their annual military exercises.
It’s the third time Kim was reported to have observed military exercises since the start of the 11-day South Korean-U.S. exercises, which he views as rehearsals for an invasion. That’s a less provocative option than missile tests. North Korea has intensified launches since 2022 and ramped up belligerent rhetoric this year.
At the tank drills Wednesday, Kim praised the country’s latest tank as “the world’s most powerful” and told his troops to bolster their “fighting spirits” and complete “preparations for war,” according to the official Korean Central News Agency. The other two drills he inspected recently were dedicated to artillery firing and manoeuvring exercises.
The tank was first unveiled during a military parade in 2020, and its rolling during Wednesday’s drill indicates that it’s ready to be deployed, South Korean experts say.
Photos of the tank released by North Korea shows it has a launch tube for missiles, a weapons systems the former Soviet Union already operated in the 1970s. The new tank could pose a threat to South Korea, said Yang Uk, an analyst at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, but it remains to be seen whether it can be mass produced.
The North’s Defense Ministry last week threatened “responsible military activities” in reaction to the South Korea-U.S. military training, which involved a computer-simulated command post training and 48 kinds of field exercises, twice the number conducted last spring. The U.S. and South Korea have been expanding their training exercises in a tit-for-tat response to the North’s weapons testing spree.
Concerns about North Korea’s military preparations have deepened since Kim vowed in a speech in January to rewrite the constitution to eliminate the country’s long-standing goal to seek peaceful unification of the Korean Peninsula and cement South Korea as its “invariable principal enemy.” He said the new constitution must specify North Korea would annex and subjugate the South if another war breaks out.
Kim’s moves signals “North Korea’s fundamental change on its South Korea policy, beyond just rhetoric,” as the North’s previous push for inter-Korean unity had allowed it to make a steadfast call for the removal of U.S. troops in South Korea, a senior South Korean presidential official told a small group of reporters Monday. He requested anonymity, citing the delicate nature of the issue.
Observers say Kim likely wants to use his upgraded weapons arsenal to win U.S. concessions like extensive relief of international sanctions on North Korea. They say North Korea is expected to extend its testing activities and ramp up warlike rhetoric this year as South Korea holds parliamentary elections in April and the U.S. a presidential election in November.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,597,Kim Jong Un test-drives North Korea's new battle tank,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a mock battle drill and drove a new-model tank himself, state-run media reported Thursday. Photo by KCNA/UPI
SEOUL, March 14 (UPI) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a military training drill and drove a new battle tank that he claimed was the world's ""most powerful,"" state-run media reported Thursday. The drill, which was held on Wednesday, was a mock battle between tank units meant to simulate ""actual combat capabilities and make them get familiar with combat action methods on different tactical missions,"" Korean Central News Agency reported.

Kim ""expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the new-type main battle tank successfully demonstrated its very excellent striking power and maneuverability, displaying its amazing militant performance for the first time,"" KCNA said.
The winner of the training battle was the 105th Tank Division, which had occupied Seoul during the Korean War, according to KCNA.
After the drill, Kim reportedly mounted and drove one of the new vehicles, which he said were ""the most powerful tanks in the world."" Several images released by state media showed Kim's helmeted head peering out of a cockpit.
The North Korean leader's latest visit to a military site came as the United States and South Korea continued their large-scale Freedom Shield joint exercise, which wraps up on Thursday.

The 11-day exercise has focused on countering threats from the nuclear-armed North and includes 48 joint field drills, almost twice as many as last year.
On Thursday, U.S. and South Korean forces staged live-fire drills near the inter-Korean border, the South's Army said in a press release. The drills, which began last week, involved 300 personnel and South Korean K1A2 tanks, K21 armored vehicles and FA-50 fighter jets.
North Korea regularly condemns the allies' joint exercises as rehearsals for an invasion and has used the drills in the past as a pretext for its own missile tests.
Last week, Kim oversaw an artillery firing drill that included a demonstration of long-range units with the range to bombard Seoul.
The United States and South Korea have increased their military cooperation over the past two years in response to the North's provocations, with expanded drills and the deployment of U.S. assets such as aircraft carriers, a B-52 nuclear bomber and a nuclear ballistic missile submarine to the Korean Peninsula.",2024-03-14 06:44:00,https://www.upi.com,UPI News,597,north leader kim un mock battle drill drove tank medium photo march 14 north leader kim un military training drill drove new battle tank powerful medium drill mock battle tank meant simulate actual combat make get familiar combat action different tactical central news agency expressed great satisfaction fact main battle tank successfully excellent striking power maneuverability amazing militant performance first time winner training battle 105th tank division war according drill kim reportedly mounted drove one new said powerful world several state medium helmeted head north latest visit military site came united south korea continued freedom shield joint exercise 11day exercise north 48 joint field almost twice many last u south staged near border army said press release last week involved 300 personnel south k1a2 k21 armored fa50 fighter korea regularly ally joint invasion used past pretext missile week kim artillery firing drill included demonstration range bombard united south korea military past two response expanded deployment u asset aircraft b52 nuclear bomber nuclear ballistic missile submarine peninsula kim un north new battle tank
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,598,North Korea’s Kim ‘drives’ new tank during mock battle,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided a military demonstration involving a new battle tank, state media KCNA reported on Thursday, in the latest show of force by the isolated state as South Korea and the United States wrapped up joint drills.
Kim expressed “great satisfaction” that the new type of main battle tank successfully demonstrated its striking power in its first performance display on Wednesday, KCNA said.
The “training match” was designed to inspect the combat capabilities of tank crews and make them familiar with combat action on different tactical missions, it said.
“Swiftly weaving their way through various worst combat circumstances, heavy tanks hit targets at once with powerful strikes and broke through strong defence lines with high manoeuvrability,” the report said.
The 105th Tank Division, which was declared the winner of the mock battle, was the unit which occupied the South Korean capital Seoul during the Korean War, KCNA said.
Kim was joined by senior officials including Defence Minister Kang Sun Nam at the event.
In a photograph published by KCNA, the leader of the reclusive state could be seen with his head peaking out of a tank as the state media reported he drove the tank himself.
Meanwhile, other photographs showed Kim sporting a leather jacket and surrounded by troops, and also tanks with the North Korean flag blasting ammunition on a field.
The mock battle comes as joint annual drills involving South Korea and the U.S. were due to wrap up on Thursday. The drills, known as the Freedom Shield exercises, were the first to take place since Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 inter-Korean military pact aimed at de-escalating tensions in November.
As part of the drills, South Korea’s army said the combined forces had conducted a joint live fire exercise at a training base in the city of Pocheon in the past week.
The live fire drill featured tanks, armoured cars as well as FA-50 fighter jets, the army said in a statement.
North Korea has long condemned such military drills as rehearsals for war, while Seoul has portrayed the exercises as purely defensive.
Kim’s appearance at the demonstration comes after he guided an artillery firing drill by the Korean People’s Army, the country’s military force, last week.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,601,"Kensington Palace Not A 'Trusted Source' Amid Kate Middleton Photoshop Scandal, AFP Director Says","Topline
The global news director of Agence France-Presse, one of the world's biggest news agencies, told the BBC that Kensington Palace is no longer a ""trusted source"" after releasing a doctored photo of Kate Middleton and her three children, and said AFP’s decision to “kill” the photo of Middleton was a rare, dramatic move normally reserved for North Korean or Iranian propaganda.
A picture shows stories in Britain's national newspapers about the altered mother's day photo ... [+] released by Kensington Palace on March 10. AFP via Getty Images
Key Facts
Phil Chetwynd, global news director of AFP, told Ros Atkins of BBC Radio 4’s ""The Media Show” that the agency works with Kensington Palace “all the time” and it was considered to be a “trusted source” before it provided the altered photo of Kate and her children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. AFP, the Associated Press and other news wires issued a “kill notice” for the photo on Sunday, asking its member sources to stop circulating the picture because it had been altered to a degree that it no longer met ethical standards—a dramatic move that Chetwynd said has previously been taken for news issued by the ""North Korean news agency or the Iranian news agency, to give you some background or context.” To issue a kill notice is a “big deal,” he added, saying that “to kill something on the basis of manipulation” is rare and happens maybe once per year. Chetwynd said AFP asked Kensington Palace for the original, unaltered photo or photos and did receive a reply. When asked if the palace was still to be trusted as a source, Chetwynd answered candidly: “No. Absolutely not. Like with anything, when you’re let down by a source, the bar is raised and we’ve got major issues internally.”
Key Background
Public interest in the whereabouts of Kate Middleton has continued to grow since Kensington Palace in January announced she had been hospitalized for a planned abdominal surgery and would postpone all of her upcoming engagements while she recovered, which could take months. Before the announcement, the Princess of Wales had not been seen or heard from since Christmas Day. After the surgery, Kate is said to have returned home to Windsor on Jan. 29 to continue her recovery. As public speculation about her health and whereabouts continued to grow, Kensington Palace on Sunday, March 10, released a photo of Kate and her three children to celebrate Mother’s Day in the United Kingdom. The palace said the photo was taken by Prince William, Kate's husband. Almost immediately, eagle-eyed royal watchers noticed a number of odd inconsistencies in the photo that suggested it had been majorly edited or altered. That same day, agencies like AFP and the Associated Press issued the kill notices, asking news agencies to stop circulating the photo because it “appeared the source had manipulated the image."" AFP said the modifications made to the photo were in ""violation of the ethical standards of the profession."" The next day, Monday, Kate issued an apology for causing “confusion” and said she occasionally experiments with editing images like “many amateur photographers.”
Crucual Quote
“It’s actually not even very well photoshopped. There are clearly a lot of issues with the photo,” Chetwynd said. “It shouldn’t have been validated. I think as soon as it was, all of the photo editors at all of the major agencies immediately saw there was a problem and got together and spoke about it and said ‘what do we do?’”
What To Watch For
Another update from the palace. In seeming response to the backlash of the edited photo release on Sunday, Middleton was photographed in the backseat of a car leaving Windsor Castle the next day. That photo, taken by photo agency Goff Photos, is also under scrutiny for photo editing. The agency has denied doctoring the photo. Kate has not been seen since and Kensington Palace has issued no other statements on her wellbeing or whereabouts.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,605,Spending time with a dog can help to relieve stress: study,"No arf-ing kidding.
Any canine owner can tell you that dogs relieve stress — now, a new study backs them up.
Researchers from Konkuk University in South Korea discovered that spending time with dogs helps people relax and concentrate.
Dogs really do make people feel less stressed. Shutterstock
For the study, published in Plos One, the experts recruited 30 adults and measured their brainwaves via electrode headsets, while they interacted with a lovable poodle named Aro.
They did the following eight activities with Aro for 3 minutes each: meeting, walking, playing, feeding, hugging, massaging and photographing.
Researchers found that walking a dog made a person feel more relaxed, brushing a dog improved participants’ concentration and playing with a dog yielded all of the above.
When playing with Aro and a squeaky toy, researchers had stronger alpha brain waves, which are associated with relaxation. Walking her in a park trail also produced alpha waves.
When participants brushed the dog and massaged her they produced more beta brain waves, which are correlated with concentration.
The researchers also asked people how they felt after each activity with Aro and they all reported feeling less stress and depressed.
The participants all said that their moods improved after hugging Aro and feeding her treats.

“This study demonstrated that specific dog activities could activate stronger relaxation, emotional stability, attention, concentration and creativity by facilitating increased brain activity,” the study authors wrote.
This isn’t the first study to show that spending time with dogs is good for people’s mental health.
A 2022 study published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology found that spending just 20 minutes with an animal can decrease cortisol, the stress hormone, and increase oxytocin, the hormone associated with love and bonding.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,607,"US-South Korea defense talks on track, but November not a hard deadline-US official","U.S.-South Korean talks on sharing the cost of keeping American troops in South Korea are on track and ahead of schedule, but the U.S. side does not necessarily see a hard deadline ahead of the November U.S. election, a senior Biden administration official told Reuters.
The two sides named envoys this month to launch a new early round of talks for a deal to take effect in 2026. South Korean media said the aim was for an agreement before any comeback by Donald Trump, who during his presidency accused Seoul of ""free-riding"" on U.S. military might. Trump
demanded Seoul pay as much as $5 billion a year for the deployment of some 28,500 American troops as part of efforts to deter nuclear-armed North Korea. The U.S. official said the talks were ""very much on track and ahead of schedule.""
""I can't say at this moment quite how soon they'll wrap, but we are not seeing major hurdles. And we're seeing a lot of political will on both sides,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We're fairly confident that our incentives are aligned, and that we will get these negotiations done. So we'd like to make quick progress, but ... don't necessarily see November as a hard deadline.""
South Korea began shouldering the costs of U.S. deployments, used to fund local labor, the construction of military installations and other logistics support, in the early 1990s. The current agreement is set to expire in 2025, with negotiations on a successor pact usually held just before the end of the existing one.
During Trump's presidency, both sides had struggled for months to make progress, before reaching a deal when Seoul agreed to increase its contribution by 13.9%, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades. Trump is set to face off against President Joe Biden in the November election.
A senior South Korean presidential official said this week Seoul expects no fundamental shift in relations with the United States even if U.S. voters elect a new president, but hopes to make progress on defense cost-sharing talks and other issues this year.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,608,Korea Sets Release of Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' With Robert Pattinson,"South Korean cinema-goers will get a three-day jump on the rest of the world when the Bong Joon-ho-directed “Mickey 17” releases in January 2025 in time for the Lunar New Year holidays.
Warner Bros. Pictures says that the Robert Pattinson-starring sci-fi film will open in Korea on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, ahead of its global outing on Jan. 31.
The film was originally announced as opening in cinemas in March 2024, but WBD recently pushed that back by nine months to allow the picture to be completed. Production had been affected by Hollywood’s writers’ and actors’ strikes in 2023.
“Mickey 17” is Bong’s first feature as director since “Parasite,” which became the first non-English language movie to win best picture at the Oscars. In addition to writing and directing, Bong also produces the upcoming film through his company Offscreen. Additional producers include Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner of Plan B and Dooho Choi of Kate Street Pictures.
The film is adapted from Edward Ashton’s 2022 novel, described by publisher St. Martin Press as a high-concept cerebral thriller in the vein of “The Martian” and “Dark Matter.” Pattinson plays an “expendable” — a disposable employee on a human expedition sent to colonize an ice planet — who refuses to let his replacement clone take his place. The cast also includes Naomi Ackie, Steven Yeun, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo.
“Director Bong’s creativity, vision and imagination always exceed expectations. ‘Mickey 17’ will surprise audiences with its original story and characters, unpredictable plot development and humor, as well as great production qualities. Korea, director Bong’s mother country, was our first choice in terms of where to debut the film. All of us here at Warner Bros. are very excited to share ‘Mickey 17’ with audiences in Korea and beyond,” said Warner Bros.

Kim also expressed ""great satisfaction"" that a new type of main battle tank successfully demonstrated its striking power in its first display of performance at what KCNA described as a ""training match."" The military event was designed to strictly inspect the actual combat capabilities of tank crews and make them familiar with combat action methods on different tactical missions, KCNA reported.
""Swiftly weaving their way through various worst combat circumstances, heavy tanks hit targets at once with powerful strikes and broke through strong defense lines with high maneuverability,"" the report said. Kim was joined by senior officials including Defence Minister Kang Sun Nam at the event.
The leader of the reclusive state was pictured in one photo sporting a leather jacket surrounded by troops in front of a tank. In another, multiple tanks with the North Korean flag were firing ammunition on a field. Kim also emphasised the need to organise intensive exercises simulating an actual war and training matches for enhancing combat capability to be able to carry out any combat mission promptly and accurately in any contingency.
Kim's appearance at the demonstration came days after he guided an artillery firing drill by the Korean People's Army, the country's military force, last week.

Kim Jong Un, along with Defence Minister Kang Sun Nam and other top officials, observed as tank units manoeuvred through challenging simulated combat conditions. These tanks showed precision in hitting targets and agility in breaking through defensive lines.
“Swiftly weaving their way through various worst combat circumstances, heavy tanks hit targets at once with powerful strikes and broke through strong defense lines with high maneuverability,"" Reuters quoted the report as stating.
The demonstration aimed to evaluate the combat readiness of the tank crews and acquaint them with various combat strategies for different tactical missions.

Kim stressed the importance of conducting rigorous drills that mimic real-war situations. Such exercises are crucial for enhancing the military's overall combat proficiency. It enables the country to respond promptly and accurately to any emergency.

The pop singer, songwriter and actor (real name: Max Schneider) teams up with the K-pop icon on “Stupid in Love,” the opening track on his new album Love In Stereo.
The fresh cut is bursting with pop vitality, and, since the stroke of midnight, is accompanied with an official music video that follows Max on his travels from Los Angeles, CA to Seoul, South Korea where the pair get down to moving and grooving for the cameras.

“Stupid in Love” came about in a moment of serendipity. Max made his own luck; he was visiting South Korea to work with a producer on music for BTS, when one of the lads suggested the idea of a collaboration with Le Sserafim.
He showed up to a meeting, “and they gave me this gift, which is a really beautiful thing in Korea — a lot of times you give your gift as an album and write a letter,” he tells People. “Yunjin wrote me a letter, and it was like, ‘I hope we get to meet and work together,'” he recounts. “It was really endearing, so I extended my trip to see her live.” The connections run deeper than a love of pop music; both artists were raised in New York.
Trending on Billboard
Le Sserafim is hot right now. The South Korean pop group became a Billboard Hot 100-charting act for the first time this year, thanks to the single, “Easy,” debuting at No. 99.
The group’s five-track EP of the same name bowed at No. 8 on the Billboard 200. Also, Easy started at No. 2 on both the World Albums and Top Album Sales charts, while the title track roared to No. 6 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, marking the group’s second, and top charting, top 10 effort.
Max enjoyed a breakthrough with his tender pop hit “Lights Down Low” featuring gnash, which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart back in 2016. The New Yorker has also collaborated with the likes of BTS and bandmate Suga, Hayley Kiyoko, Noah Cyrus and Chromeo, many of whom assisted on his 2020 project, Colour Vision.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,616,Samsung reveals two mega budget Android phones with a major premium upgrade and battery that 'lasts two days',"SAMSUNG has launched a pair of smartphones that won't break the bank despite flaunting some premium level features.
It's been a busy year for the Korean tech giant already, having launched big AI boasting Samsung Galaxy S24 phones in January.
1 Samsung's new phones start from £339 Credit: Samsung
But now it's time for some new arrivals in the mid-range price point.
The two new devices are called the Galaxy A55 5G and the Galaxy A35 5G.
It's the first time Samsung has included its top level security upgrades on the budget Galaxy A series of handsets.
And there's also a killer battery that Samsung claims can last up to two days on a single charge.
They flaunt improved cameras capable of taking better snaps in the dark too.
Both are secured by Samsung Knox, the company's multi-layer security platform that's designed to keep critical information safe and protect against bank-raiding vulnerabilities.
A 5000mAh battery is on board - which is the same size as the company's top-of-the-range Galaxy S24 Ultra and bigger than any iPhone battery too.
The only real difference between the two is a slightly different chipset under the hood to power things - the A55 is a bit stronger on that front.
And the cameras aren't identical either, with the selfie cam coming in at 32-megapixels on the A55 compared to 13-megapixels on the A35.
Aside from that, they look exactly the same with a 6.6-inch display and four colour options.
The Samsung Galaxy S24 has a number of big AI features
These include:
Awesome Ice Blue
Awesome Lemon
Awesome Lilac
Awesome Navy
""Our ambition is to bring the latest technologies to everyone,"" explained James Kitto, Vice President and Head of MX Division, Samsung UK and Ireland.
""We’re really pleased to be opening up even more possibilities on our competitively priced Galaxy A series devices, including offering Samsung Knox Vault for the first time on this line-up, meaning that users can enjoy our outstanding mobile experiences with even more confidence and security.""
Prices start at £339, depending on the model and storage size you go for.
Both are available to buy from March 20.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,617,"Russia Could Soon Receive More Weapons From North Korea, Analysts Say","Maritime shipments of North Korean weapons to Russia appear to have resumed after a monthlong pause.
Satellite imagery appears to show Russia-flagged cargo ships return to the North Korean city of Rason, which it and three other U.S.-sanctioned vessels have visited dozens of times since last summer to take on suspected war materiel destined for the Ukrainian battlefield, North Korea-focused analyst group NK Pro wrote Monday.
Washington has accused Pyongyang of aiding Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which reached the two-year mark on February 24.
The Kim Jong Un regime's munitions factories have been running at full capacity, with more than 6,700 containers carrying millions of munitions believed to have been shipped to Russia in exchange for essential resources like food, according to South Korean defense authorities.

Howitzers with Russia's 9th Guards Artillery Brigade fire at the Luzhsky training ground near Saint Petersburg, Russia. Ukrainian intelligence has said Russia has imported some 1.5 million artillery rounds from North Korea.
Newsweek reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry and North Korean Embassy in China with written requests for comment.
Sunday marked the first time since February 12 that near-daily satellite surveillance imagery captured a ship at either port.
Medium-resolution photos provided to NK Pro by Planet Labs appear to show cranes removing containers from a vessel matching the description of the Lady R that was docked at Rason Port's Pier 1, where the Russian ships have in the past offloaded cargo before being loaded at Pier 2.
Items believed to be containers earmarked for export began accumulating at Pier 2 in the two days before the suspected Russian vessel arrived, which is consistent with past shipments.
Newsweek could not independently confirm the ship in question was the Lady R.
Past analysis traced the Lady R to Russia's Vostochny, where it was loaded with containers early last month, then to waters east of country's far-eastern port city of Vladivostok. There the ship remained until it disappeared between March 7 and 9, just before its alleged reappearance at Rason.
Russia is already expanding its own munitions production to maintain its ground operations in Ukraine. Despite the expansion, fluctuating shortages, especially of artillery ammunition like 152-millimeter shells, challenging Russia's long-term military effectiveness in the conflict.
Ukrainian defense intelligence agency Main Intelligence Directorate, also known as GUR, estimated last month that Russia had imported some 1.5 million artillery shells from its reclusive neighbor.
""But these munitions are from the 70s and 80s. Half of them do not function, and the rest require either restoration or inspection before use,"" the agency's No. 2 said.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,620,"On the Tripwire of a ‘Red Line,’ It’s Often Presidents Who Trip","When President Biden declared over the weekend that he was drawing a “red line” for Israel’s military action in Gaza, he appeared to be trying to raise the potential cost for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as their relationship plummets to new depths.
But he never said what would happen, exactly, if Mr. Netanyahu ignored him and continued Israel’s military operation by invading the southern city Rafah, a step that Mr. Biden has said — repeatedly — would be a major mistake. It is unclear whether he hesitated because he did not want to signal what response he might be preparing, or because he did not want to be criticized if he backed away from whatever action he is contemplating.
Or perhaps, given his long experience in the Senate and the White House, he remembered that drawing red lines turned out badly for Barack Obama when it came to Syria, and for George W. Bush when it came to North Korea and Iran. American allies in the Middle East were stunned by Mr. Obama’s reversal. Mr. Bush was later judged to have invaded a country that had no nuclear weapons — Iraq — while the North tested its first nuclear weapon on his watch.
Mr. Biden’s line-drawing was immediately dismissed — and matched — by Mr. Netanyahu, who shot back: “You know, I have a red line. You know what the red line is?

FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,622,"South Korea sees no change in US ties regardless of November election, says official","SEOUL – South Korea expects no fundamental shift in relations with the United States even if American voters elect a new president, but hopes to make progress on defence cost-sharing talks and other issues in 2024, a senior presidential official said.
The official, speaking with a small group of journalists on March 11, said South Korea does not devise its policy based on predictions on the US presidential election in November, but that both sides will try to advance efforts to bolster security partnerships before that.
The allies have agreed to launch early talks on sharing the cost of keeping US troops in South Korea, and will accelerate discussions to boost Seoul’s say in operating US extended deterrence, including the American nuclear umbrella, the official said.
“There is an incentive for the Biden administration to work more actively on the issues as it wraps up its first term in 2024,” the official said.
“We share the need to make some achievements, and that’s why both sides have agreed to begin the defence cost-sharing negotiations and complete the work on extended deterrence.”
The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said its delegation visited South Korea in December to discuss the defence cost-sharing deal and would work with Seoul to prepare for talks on the next agreement.
Former president Donald Trump, favoured to be the Republican candidate in the election, had accused South Korea, a key Asian ally, of “free-riding” on US military might, called for stopping what he said were “expensive” war games, and demanded that Seoul pay as much as US$5 billion (S$6.6 billion) a year for the US deployment.
If Trump is elected, South Korea will work with his government, but the alliance will remain unchanged in part because of solid support from the US Congress for greater bilateral cooperation and a trilateral partnership involving Japan, the official said.
“There’s a difference between what you say as a candidate and what you actually do as a responsible head of state who carries out global policies,” the official said.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,624,South Korea criticizes senior doctors for threatening to resign to support their juniors' walkouts,"Doctors stage a rally against the government's medical policy in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, March. 3, 2024. South Korea's government expressed deep regret over the news that some senior doctors could join the protracted walkouts by thousands of junior doctors, saying Tuesday, March 12, the people wont understand another collective action that threatens the lives of patients.(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)
SEOUL – South Korea's government criticized senior doctors at a major hospital Tuesday for threatening to resign in support of the weekslong walkouts by thousands of medical interns and residents that have disrupted hospital operations.
About 12,000 junior doctors in South Korea have been off the job for a month to protest a government plan to sharply increase medical school admissions. Officials say the plan is meant to add more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging society, but doctors say universities can’t handle an abrupt, steep increase in the number of students, and that would eventually hurt the quality of South Korea’s medical services.

The government began steps a week ago to suspend the licenses of the striking doctors, after they missed a government-set Feb. 29 deadline for their return.
The walkouts now threaten to enter a critical phase as senior doctors at the Seoul National University Hospital and its affiliated hospitals decided Monday to resign en mass if the government doesn’t come up with measures that can address the dispute by early next week. Senior doctors at other major university hospitals could take similar steps.
“If the government doesn’t take steps toward sincere, reasonable measures to resolve the issue, we decided to submit resignations, starting from March 18,” Bang JaeSeung, leader of the Seoul hospital's emergency committee, told reporters Monday.
But the committee's decision doesn't make participation mandatory, so it's unclear how many doctors could turn in resignations. There are a total of about 1,480 medical professors at the Seoul National University Hospital and its three affiliated hospitals, most of whom concurrently work as doctors there.
Most doctors who submit resignations will likely continue to work to prevent a medical crisis, unless hospital authorities accept their resignations immediately, emergency committee officials said. But by law, they said the doctors' resignations will be automatically processed a month after their submissions.
Last week, the University of Ulsan College of Medicine in the southeast also decided to let its senior doctors submit resignations on a voluntary basis, according to Kim Mi-na, head of the university's emergency committee.
In a briefing Tuesday, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo called the Seoul National University Hospital doctor’s decision “very regrettable.” He said they should work with the government to persuade the junior doctors to return to work.
“The people would find it difficult to understand another collective resignation that would put the lives of patients at risk,” Park said.
He said that Health Minister Cho KyooHong met some of the striking junior doctors on Monday, but he refused to provide details of the meeting. There were no immediate reports of a breakthrough.
It was the first meeting between the government and the strikers since authorities began taking a series of administrative steps on March 4 to suspend the strikers' licenses. The steps include dispatching officials to confirm the absences of the strikers, sending notices about the planned suspensions, and giving them opportunities to respond before the license suspensions take effect.
Officials have said the striking doctors would face minimum three-month license suspensions and prosecutions. No suspensions have been reported completed yet.
The striking junior doctors represent only about 6.5% of the country’s 140,000 doctors. But in some major hospitals like the Seoul National University Hospital, they account for about 30%-40% of the total doctors, assisting senior doctors during surgeries and dealing with inpatients while training. Their walkouts have subsequently caused numerous canceled surgeries and other treatments at their hospitals and burdened South Korea’s medical service.
In early February, South Korea's government said it would increase the country's medical school enrollment quota by 2,000 starting next year, from the current cap of 3,058 that has been unchanged since 2006.
Officials say South Korea's doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest in the developed world, and that more doctors are required to address a long-standing shortage of physicians in rural areas and in essential yet low-paying specialties.
But doctors say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also result in doctors performing unnecessary treatment due to increased competition.
The doctors' protests have failed to win public support. Critics say doctors — one of the best-paid professions in South Korea — are only worrying about the possibility of a lower income in the future.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,625,South Korea doctors’ strike: government moves to suspend thousands of medical licences,"South Korea’s government has started taking steps to suspend the medical licences of thousands of striking doctors, as concern grows that the month-long dispute is affecting frontline health care services.
The walkout by almost 12,000 doctors from 100 teaching hospitals has led to surgery cancellations, longer waiting times and delays in treatment, including for patients seeking emergency care, according to media reports.
The health ministry said it had put in motion procedures that could see 4,900 of the striking doctors lose their licences if they continue to defy orders to return to work.
The ministry also said it had sent administrative notifications, following up on warnings that strikers faced a three-month suspension – a punishment that could delay their ability to qualify as specialists for at least a year.
The increasingly acrimonious dispute began as a protest against government plans to dramatically raise the number of trainee doctors to address shortages in rural areas and greater demand on services caused by South Korea’s rapidly ageing population.
But the 11,994 striking doctors, who make up 93% of the trainee workforce, claim the recruitment of 2,000 additional students a year from 2025 will compromise the quality of services. Instead, they have called for improvements to pay and conditions.
This week the health ministry said it would assign 20 military surgeons and 138 public health doctors to boost staff numbers at selected hospitals, but denied that the country’s health services had descended into chaos.
Chun Byung-wang, director of the ministry’s health and medical policy division, suggested that doctors who return will avoid punishment. “The government will take into account the circumstance and protect trainee doctors if they return to work before the administrative measure is complete,” Chun said.
He added: “The government will not give up on dialogue. The door is always open. The government will respect and listen to opinions of the medical community as a companion for the medical reforms.”
In an attempt to resolve the dispute, the government last week announced measures to improve pay and conditions for trainee medics, as well as a review of continuous 36-hour shifts – a key grievance among junior medics. But the concessions have failed to placate doctors.
Demands are growing for the two sides to negotiate.
“Doctors and the government are not in a boxing ring,” the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial. “People’s patience is wearing thin … the exit from this quagmire must be found through dialogue between the two sides.”
Critics of the recruitment plan have accused the country’s conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, of using the medical reforms to boost his People Power party’s prospects at next month’s national assembly elections.
A poll published last week by the Yonhap news agency found 84% of respondents supported hiring more doctors, and 43% said striking physicians should receive severe punishments.",2024-03-12 05:06:24,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian,625,south government taking suspend medical striking concern dispute affecting health care walkout almost 12000 100 teaching led surgery longer waiting time treatment seeking emergency care according medium health ministry said put motion could see 4900 striking lose continue defy return ministry also said sent administrative following faced suspension punishment could delay ability qualify least increasingly acrimonious dispute protest government dramatically raise number trainee address rural greater demand south rapidly 11994 striking make 93 trainee claim recruitment 2000 additional year 2025 compromise quality instead pay week health ministry said would assign 20 military 138 public health boost staff selected health director health medical policy division return avoid punishment government take account circumstance protect trainee return work administrative measure complete chun added government give dialogue door always open government respect listen medical community companion medical attempt resolve dispute government last week improve pay trainee well review continuous 36hour key grievance among junior placate growing two side government boxing ring newspaper said editorial patience wearing thin … exit quagmire must found dialogue two recruitment plan accused conservative president medical boost people power next national assembly poll last week news agency found 84 43 said striking receive severe south korea strike government suspend medical
TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,626,East Asia’s baby bonuses aren’t solving falling birth rates,"Governments across Asia—in Singapore and Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul—are facing a crisis: plummeting birth rates.
For several decades now, people in East Asian economies have had fewer and fewer children. Last year, South Korea beat its own record for having the world’s lowest birth rate, reporting 0.72 births per woman for 2023, down from 0.78 in 2022. Singapore reported 0.97 births per woman, the first time the rate has fallen below one. Japan has one of the world’s oldest populations, with a median age of 49.5. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China are all reporting falling birth rates as well.
All of these economies have fertility rates far below 2.1, the “replacement rate” which allows for a stable population. They haven’t reported a rate above 2.1 for years, if not decades.
A low birth rate leads to a shrinking population, and a smaller workforce to produce the goods and services that lead to economic growth. Slower economic activity results in drops in fiscal revenue, giving fewer resources to a government that now needs to provide welfare for a growing elderly population.
Academics often point to the cost of childcare, poor work-life balance, a lack of support for new parents (particularly mothers), and the stresses of modern society as reasons for falling birth rates. “In all the cosmopolitan cities, the fertility rate tends to be much lower because [people have] a lot of choices. The higher the development, [the] more urbanized, the more education that women get, the smaller the family size,” Paul Cheung, director of the Asia Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, says.
Faced with this looming crisis, Asian governments have turned to a straightforward solution: Give prospective parents money if they have kids. The connection is simple to understand. If a major barrier to having children is the cost of childcare, then alleviating that cost with extra cash should change someone’s economic calculus.
Except it hasn’t worked. Even Singapore, which Cheung suggests had a “way more generous [policy] than all the Asian countries,” has not succeeded in arresting the decline in fertility.
“Low birth rates are a reflection of big institutional, cultural, structural problems,” said Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor of social science and public policy at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “Throwing a bit of money at it is not going to fix it.”
What are governments currently doing to stop falling birth rates?
Cheung, before his stint as an academic, was the director of Singapore’s population planning unit between 1987 and 1994. He helped start Singapore’s pronatalist policy, offering a relatively more generous set of incentives to encourage more births. The government even organized events to help single Singaporeans to meet.
Singapore’s government officially inaugurated its baby bonus scheme in 2001. The most current payout is 11,000 Singapore dollars ($8,263) for each first and second child and 13,000 Singapore dollars ($9,766) each for the third and subsequent child.
Other governments are also trying to dole out incentives. Japan increased its lump-sum childbirth benefit to 500,000 yen ($3,400) in April last year. Starting this October, the government will also offer 15,000 yen ($102) a month to households after the birth of a first and second child until the age of 2, and then continue providing 10,000 yen ($68) till high school. The government will offer more money to families with more than two children.
South Korea has increased its incentives, too. The government gives 2 million Korean won ($1,519) to parents when a baby is born, which increases to 3 million won ($2,279) for the second child. Parents will also get an allowance of up to 18 million won ($13,674) in total for the first two years of the child’s life.
Hong Kong, on the other hand, is offering a one-off cash allowance of HKD 20,000 ($2,557).
Singapore’s birth rate is declining at a slower pace than that of other Asian economies, only falling below 1.0 last year. (By comparison, Hong Kong’s fertility rate first fell below 1.0 in 2001, and hovered around that level before falling back below 1.0 again in 2020). Singapore’s population is still stable, but that may be the result of the country’s more liberal immigration policies, compared with Japan and South Korea.
All these measures seem to do is “delay the population decline a little into the future,” Cheung says.
‘I feel sorry for the government’
The scary thought for demographers may now be that there’s no easy fix for falling fertility. Even Nordic countries, whose more generous pro-child policies were credited with keeping birth rates relatively high, have seen fertility collapse after the COVID pandemic.
“The strange thing with fertility is nobody really knows what’s going on,” Anna Rotkirch, a research director at Family Federation of Finland’s Population Research Institute, told the Financial Times earlier this year. The demographer, who advised former prime minister Sanna Marin on population policy, now thinks fertility decline is “not primarily driven by economics or family policies. It’s something cultural, psychological, biological, cognitive.”
Research from Singapore implies that a drop in fertility could be the result of something more fundamental in how people live in modern society. Tan Poh Lin, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore, found rates of sexual intercourse among married heterosexual couples in Singapore—a “high-stress” society—were lower than the ideal frequency to conceive, generally considered to be five or six times every 30 days. There were “strong negative effects of both stress and fatigue, especially during weekdays,” she writes. Other surveys in Japan and South Korea report similar findings.
But if monetary incentives or better social welfare programs and work-life balance, as in northern European countries, are not getting birth rates to what they should be, then what can Asian economies do to raise them?
“I feel sorry for the government because it’s the only organization or institution doing anything,” Gietel-Basten said. “In reality, everyone has to take responsibility for this. Companies have to change their attitude and recognize children are a social good, and that parents should be supported and not penalized,” he says. “But that costs money.”
Some companies in Asia have made high-profile offers to support employees having children. In February, a South Korean construction firm, the Booyoung Group, offered a bonus worth 100 million won ($76,000) to encourage female employees to have children. China’s Trip.com Group also offered some employees a 10,000 yuan ($1,391) annual bonus for households for every child under the age of five.
But there’s no quick solution, says Gietel-Basten. Instead, he suggests that governments focus on other economic well-being issues—like youth unemployment, job security, and a sense that work is being valued—and hope that indirectly improves fertility rates.
In mainland China, “there’s not even jobs for the young people who are alive now,” he says. “Why do you want to have more children?”",2024-03-12 04:00:00,https://fortune.com,Fortune,626,across facing crisis birth several people east last year south korea beat record birth rate 072 per woman 2023 078 2022 097 per woman first time rate fallen one japan one median age 495 hong china falling birth fertility far 21 replacement rate stable population havent rate 21 low birth rate shrinking population smaller produce good lead economic growth economic activity fiscal revenue giving government need provide welfare growing elderly often point cost poor balance lack support new particularly modern society falling birth cosmopolitan fertility rate much lower people lot higher development education get smaller family size director competitiveness institute lee kuan yew school public policy looming crisis turned straightforward solution give prospective money connection simple understand major barrier cost cost extra cash change economic worked even way generous policy arresting decline birth reflection big institutional cultural structural said professor social science public policy hong university science technology throwing bit money going fix currently stop falling birth stint academic director population unit 1987 1994 start policy offering relatively generous set encourage government even organized help single government officially baby bonus scheme 2001 current 11000 8263 first second child 13000 9766 third subsequent also trying dole japan childbirth benefit 500000 yen 3400 last year starting government also offer 15000 yen 102 month birth first second child age 2 continue providing 10000 yen 68 till high school government offer money two korea government 2 million 1519 baby born 3 million 2279 second child also get allowance 18 million 13674 total first two hand offering cash allowance 20000 2557singapores birth rate pace falling 10 last year comparison hong fertility rate first fell 10 2001 around level falling back 10 2020 population still stable may result liberal immigration japan south seem delay population decline little future feel sorry scary thought may there easy fix falling fertility even whose generous keeping birth relatively high seen fertility collapse covid strange thing fertility nobody really whats going anna research director family federation population research institute told financial time year demographer advised former prime minister population policy fertility decline primarily driven economics family something cultural psychological biological drop fertility could result something fundamental people live modern society tan poh lin research fellow national university found sexual intercourse among married heterosexual lower ideal frequency conceive generally considered five six time every 30 day strong negative effect stress fatigue especially japan south korea report similar monetary better social welfare balance northern getting birth raise feel sorry government organization institution anything said reality everyone take responsibility change attitude recognize social good made support south construction firm group bonus worth 100 million 76000 encourage female group also 10000 yuan 1391 annual bonus every child age there quick solution instead focus economic youth unemployment job security sense work hope indirectly fertility china there even young people alive want east baby arent falling birth
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,627,South Korea's land minister bearish on property as population ages,"South Korea won't see a repeat of the sharp home price gains it did in the past as its population rapidly ages and economy slows, the country's land minister said, vowing to promote public rental accommodation to improve access to housing.
""The population is ageing and the economy is growing by just 2% to 3% each year. There is no way house prices will rise as they did in the past,"" Park Sang-woo, minister of land, infrastructure and transport, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday. ""In the past, the economy grew by 7% to 10% every year, and there were two or three kids in each family. There will never be a 'deja-vu' of that for this generation.""
South Korea's median house prices hit a peak in June 2021 after rising 45% over five years, according to Korea Real Estate Board data. It has since fallen 19% following an aggressive interest rate cycle by the central bank. Still, South Koreans cite high housing costs as the biggest reason behind nose-diving births and marriages. The country's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, hit a fresh record low in 2023.
According to the ministry's annual survey, house prices in 2022 were 6.3 times higher than households' annual income, easing slightly from 6.7 in 2021. In the capital Seoul, however, the price-to-income ratio was 15.2, up from 14.1 a year earlier. The government is working to provide a more affordable housing.
This year, it has rolled out cheap mortgages for newly weds who plan to have a baby. To restore work-life-balance in the wider Seoul area where 45% of population live, the government plans a high-speed underground rail network to connect less expensive housing markets in outskirts of Seoul to jobs in the city's centre. At the same time, the government will provide a greater range of long-term public rental homes through the corporate sector by easing regulations.
It will also help young people invest in assets other than real estate, he said. With real estate demand still weak, Park said he shared the views of financial authorities that unprofitable property projects needed to be restructured.
Last December, Taeyoung Engineering & Construction, a mid-sized South Korean builder, rescheduled its debt, fanning concerns about debt repayment troubles in the sector. ""The structure of real estate project financing, which had worked just fine, is now being shaken by slowing demand and rising input costs,"" Park said. ""We are making various efforts to stop that.""

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,628,Teenager dead after stabbings – as it happened,"Thank you for joining us on the blog today. Here is a wrap: Back and forth ensued over the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, comparing a pro-Palestinian protest at the Sydney Opera House to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Dutton defended the comparison today (“I don’t resile from that at all”), while the federal education minister, Jason Clare, slammed it (“if you want to run the country, you can’t run your mouth”). The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, said “it is never appropriate to compare the Port Arthur tragedy with anything, in any circumstance,” and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties argued such statements “dangerously conflate unrelated issues, leading to misinformation and unwarranted associations”. The Australian Medical Association released new analysis showing private health insurers’ management expenses and profits are the “key drivers of premium increases” for customers. Tasmania’s Liberals formally secured minority support, after independent MP and former Labor leader David O’Byrne provided a written assurance of confidence and supply. A 36-year old woman was taken to hospital after a reported stabbing at Bondi beach. In another reported stabbing across the state, one teenage boy died and another was hospitalised in Sydney’s west. New data revealed two-thirds of Tafe teachers are considering leaving the sector due to the ongoing impact of nearly a decade of Coalition cuts to public vocational education and pressure from the fee-free Tafe program. Save the Children Australia called on the Australian Government to urgently address rising starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, and avert a catastrophic famine in the occupied territory. And women in a Victorian community rocked by three recent killings demanded an end to male violence in a Ballarat rally. That is all for today, see you next week. Vaping penalties should be kept in ‘civil space’ rather than criminal, police tell NSW inquiry Assistant commissioner Scott Cook said it was not known how much money organised criminal groups made from vapes while disputing claims that gangs controlled the market. He suggested penalties around vaping be kept in the “civil space”, such as a licensing scheme under which suppliers could be threatened with cancellations. The last thing we want to see as police is criminalisation of vaping, particularly for young people – it will bring them into contact with the criminal justice system they will never get out of. The illicit market around tobacco and nicotine products with import restrictions was “nowhere near the prohibited drugs illicit market”, he added. Asked if police needed more power to control the sector, the assistant commissioner said: “no, not at all.” In addition to sufficient search and seizure powers, police had “significantly higher priorities than doing enforcement work for vapes”, he said. The committee’s deputy chair, Hugh McDermott, suggested those priorities were not for police to decide, adding that children as young as 11 were becoming addicted to illegally sold vapes due to a lack of enforcement. But Cook said if that was the government’s position, then NSW Health should be resourced to do that properly. McDermott earlier noted industry representatives declined to appear at the inquiry. - AAP Holding the smoke, students find new way to hide vaping Attempts to combat vaping could have perverse outcomes as students try to avoid detection and organised criminals eye off a market that only recently became illicit. An inquiry has been told schools are taking a health-focused approach to getting children to quit while a senior police officer has warned against criminalisation. Students caught vaping at school were being offered health-based interventions, education department deputy secretary of student wellbeing Martin Graham told a NSW parliamentary committee today. “There’s lot of vaping going on,” he said. The direction is not just about the education for why you shouldn’t vape, but also, moving them onto cessation, so helping them to get off the vapes. Graham said vaping had been added to behavioural policies with principals “who know their kids best” entitled to suspend students. Schools with a specific need for vaping detectors in toilets can request them, but they provided a false sense of security and could drive more dangerous behaviour. One that was brought to us by the young people and health professionals was suddenly a trend to try and hold the smoke in your lungs to avoid the detector … that’s just making things way worse. Enforcement since a crackdown started in January has primarily been handled by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Border Force and, more locally, NSW Health. NSW police were mainly interested in retailers with suspected links to organised crime, which assistant commissioner Scott Cook told the inquiry might take an increased foothold in a now-illicit market. “The vape market, up until recently, was supplied on a legal basis … in other countries where these vapes are coming from, they’re all legal,” he said. - AAP (More to come) A teen has died and another is in serious condition after multiple stabbings near a school in Sydney’s west. One person has been arrested, according to a NSW Police media release. Emergency services responded to the stabbings on Power Street, Doonside, about 3.40pm today. Before officers could arrive on scene, two teenage boys presented to Blacktown police station with stab wounds. They were treated at the scene for serious injuries. A teenage boy died at the scene, and the other was taken to hospital in a serious condition. Police have established crime scenes at both locations and are investigating. Inquiries are ongoing. Union denounces ACT government’s appointment of robodebt official  The Community and Public Sector Union has called out the ACT government for its decision to appoint an official involved in the robodebt scandal, saying it could have a “detrimental impact” on the union’s dealings with the territory’s administration and could “undermine the confidence of public servants”. The main public sector union has singled out the appointment of Lisa Carmody as the new deputy director general of the ACT government’s central department as “alarming”. During royal commissions hearings, Carmody, then the human service department’s acting chief counsel, said she had brief discussions in early 2017 with the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) about concerns over the scheme’s lawfulness. Ultimately, the AGS did not end up providing a legal opinion until late March 2019, more than two years later. The AGS said then the scheme was likely unlawful. The royal commission’s final report, which found the scheme was “crude and cruel” and illegal, did not make any adverse findings against Carmody. In a media release on Friday afternoon, the CPSU’s ACT regional secretary, Maddy Northam, called on the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, to reconsider the decision. The CPSU is concerned that this appointment could have a detrimental impact on the ACT government’s relationship with the union movement and undermine the confidence of public servants when raising concerns with management. An ACT government spokesperson clarified Barr was not involved in the recruitment process and added the CPSU’s assertions were not supported by the final robodebt report. A nationwide search was undertaken to recruit for this role, including a full merit based assessment and due diligence process. The Robodebt Royal Commission final report does not support the assertions of the CPSU. When Ms Carmody commences in the role, she will look to actively engage with all key stakeholders.

Dozens of species that migrate from as far away as Siberia and Alaska visit the area each year, to feed and rest alongside native birds including the endangered Australasian bittern and the vulnerable sharp-tailed sandpiper. The money, for the Coorong, Lower Lakes, Murray Mouth and South-East landscape, will be used to improve shorebird and wetland habitat. Specifically, there will be new infrastructure on wetland and flood plain flats to increase the area and duration of quality shorebird and wetland habitat, among other things. The money will underpin Australia’s commitment to international obligations including the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: Restoring the Murray Mouth, Lower Lakes and Coorong is a critical investment in the health of the whole system. This new project will ensure the survival of our internationally significant wetlands and the plants and animals who call them home. - Australian Associated Press Thanks to Emily Wind for the day’s blog coverage.

Advocacy groups call for ‘programs and funding’ in response to heat map Advocacy groups have welcomed the release of a heat map from the federal government (see earlier post) but are urging them to address the root cause of extreme heat – climate change. Emma Bacon, the executive director of Sweltering Cities, said certain communities are feeling the impacts of extreme heat more than others. She pointed to Western Sydney, facing “climate, health, housing and cost of living crises all at once”. In my experience, the people living in hot homes and hot suburbs across the country know that heatwaves are dangerous and that members of their community are at risk. People aren’t underprepared for extreme heat through lack of knowledge, they’re being prevented from following health advice because they’re anxious about electricity bills so don’t turn on air con, or they’re renters and can’t make simple upgrades to their homes to be more energy efficient. The map demonstrates that some of the most dangerous areas are home to millions of people. We need to stop burning fossil fuels that contribute to rising temperatures and will make this crisis unmanageable for the public and the government. We cannot properly adapt to run-away global warming. Bacon hopes the heat map will be a “wake up call” for the government, and said she is “eagerly awaiting” an announcement of how federal, state and territory governments will respond to the map “with programs and funding to help our communities be safe”.",2024-04-12

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,629,"While Biden and Kishida exchange praise in Washington, Japan is asking ‘what if Trump’?","Joe Biden was effusive in his praise for Japan and its “bold” prime minister, Fumio Kishida, during a state visit that took place this week amid new and growing security threats in the Asia-Pacific, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and months of political uncertainty ahead for both leaders. The first ladies, Jill Biden and Yuko Kishida, exchanged gifts and hugs, there was talk of cherry blossoms and a state banquet menu inspired by Japanese cuisine – and even a half-decent joke from Kishida about the Flintstones. But Kishida’s speech to Congress on Thursday – only the second by a Japanese leader – was largely short on humour. “I detect an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your role in the world should be,” he said. “The international order that the US worked for generations to build is facing new challenges, challenges from those with values and principles very different from ours.” He was referring to the loose alliance of nations lining up to challenge the US-led hegemony, in Europe in the form of Russia, but also closer to home in northeast Asia, where an increasingly assertive China is causing alarm in the South And East China seas, and a nuclear-armed North Korea is sinking deeper into the embrace of a needy Kremlin. But Kishida may as well have been referring to another potential threat to the international order and his country’s relations with the US – the possible election in November of Donald Trump. US-Japan ties – described by the former US ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield, as the most important in the world, “bar none” – could look very different under a Trump administration. The warning signs emerged during his first term, when Trump urged Japan – and Washington’s other “free-loading” ally in the region, South Korea – to foot more of the bill towards hosting US forces, warning that failure to comply could see those troops removed. That never came to pass, but unease about a possible Trump Mark II is running high in Japan, prompting the return to the lexicon of moshitora, or “What if Trump?” and a more emphatic follow-up: hobotora – “almost certainly Trump”. Japanese attempts to pre-emptively court Trump, and understand what his presidency might mean for Japan, have failed. Taro Aso, a former prime minister, tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting earlier this year, according to media reports, while the foreign ministry has mobilised diplomats across the US to analyse any mention of foreign policy the Republican nominee makes during his campaign. Less than eight months before the presidential election, the indications are that a Trump White House could shake the foundations of the US-Japan security arrangements referred to in such glowing terms by Biden and Kishida. Under Kishida, Japan has adhered to the US playbook, vowing to double its defence budget over five years through to 2027 and easing strained ties with its neighbour South Korea, while remaining on message over Russian sanctions. It will develop a next-generation stealth fighter jet with Britain and Italy, and acquire the ability to launch “counterstrikes” against enemy targets, presumed to be North Korean missile sites. There is talk, too, of a future role for Tokyo in the Aukus defence partnership alongside the US, Britain and Australia. A second Trump White House would throw curveballs in Japan’s direction, according to his former national security adviser John Bolton, who said recently that his former boss had a “lack of appreciation for what American alliances do”. In policy terms, that could mean rewriting the countries’ 1960 security treaty. As president, Trump criticised the “one-sided” nature of the US-Japan alliance, because the treaty requires the US to intervene if Japan is attacked but places no reciprocal obligation on its “pacifist” ally. “Get ready for Trump to say, ‘I want the treaty amended so that Japan is also obligated to defend the United States,’” Bolton said in an interview in March with Nikkei Asia. Any uncertainty in Tokyo and Seoul over US commitments to the defence of its allies would ramp up the risks in an already unstable region, he added. It would, Bolton said, “lead, in Japan, in South Korea, and elsewhere, to the question, ‘Should we get our own nuclear weapons? If we’re not under the US nuclear umbrella, maybe we need our own.’” To complicate the picture, there is no guarantee of political continuity on either side of the Pacific. When he returns to Tokyo this weekend, Kishida will be confronted by the fallout from a funding scandal that has pitted him against the most powerful faction in his ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and sparked speculation about his future. Despite disciplining dozens of MPs and apologising for the scandal, Kishida’s approval rating slumped to 23% in a poll published this week, down two percentage points from last month. While Japan does not have to hold a lower house election until autumn 2025, an LDP defeat in a byelection later this month could further weaken Kishida. “LDP lawmakers have already suggested that if the LDP loses … it could trigger a movement to unseat Kishida in the coming months,” said Tobias Harris, the founder of Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory firm in Washington. The US’s commitment to the defence of Japan is “ironclad”, Biden claimed this week. But look closer, and it is impossible to ignore the signs of danger.",2024-04-12 05:37:47,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/12/joe-biden-japan-meeting-fumio-kishida-ferdinand-marcos-donald-trump-election,The Guardian,629,joe effusive praise japan bold prime minister state visit took place week amid new growing security political uncertainty ahead first lady talk cherry state banquet menu inspired cuisine even joke speech congress second leader largely short humour detect undercurrent among role world said international order u worked build facing new different loose alliance lining challenge hegemony form russia also closer home northeast increasingly assertive china causing alarm south east china north korea sinking embrace needy kremlin may well another potential threat international order u possible election trump former u ambassador japan mike important world bar none could look different trump administration warning first term trump japan ally region south korea foot bill towards hosting u warning failure comply could see removed never came pas unease possible trump mark running high japan return lexicon trump emphatic almost certainly trump court trump understand presidency might mean japan taro former prime minister tried unsuccessfully arrange meeting year according medium foreign ministry across u analyse mention foreign policy republican nominee campaign le eight presidential election trump white house could shake security glowing japan u playbook double defence budget five 2027 easing strained south korea message develop stealth fighter jet acquire ability launch enemy north missile talk future role defence partnership alongside u second trump white house would throw direction according former national security adviser said recently former bos lack appreciation policy could mean 1960 security treaty president trump nature alliance treaty u intervene japan reciprocal obligation pacifist ally get ready trump say want treaty japan also defend united said interview march uncertainty u defence ally would ramp already unstable region added would said lead japan south korea elsewhere question get nuclear u nuclear umbrella maybe need complicate picture guarantee political continuity either side pacific weekend scandal pitted powerful faction ruling liberal democratic party sparked speculation future despite scandal approval rating 23 poll week two percentage last month japan hold lower house election autumn 2025 defeat later month could weaken already … could trigger movement unseat coming said founder japan foresight political risk advisory firm commitment defence japan ironclad week look closer impossible ignore danger exchange praise japan trump
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,630,"UK has real concerns about AI risks, says competition regulator","Just six major technology companies are at the heart of the AI sector through an “interconnected web” of more than 90 investments and partnerships links, the UK’s competition regulator has warned, sparking increased concern about the anti-competitive nature of the technology. Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, said AI foundation models – general-purpose AI systems such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini, on which consumer and business products are frequently built – were a potential “paradigm shift” for society. Speaking in Washington, she added that the immense concentration of power they represented would give a small number of companies “the ability and incentives to shape these markets in their own interests”. “When we started this work, we were curious. Now, with a deeper understanding and having watched developments very closely, we have real concerns,” Cardell said. “The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We’re committed to applying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at our disposal, now and in the future, to ensure that this transformational and structurally critical technology delivers on its promise.” The six identified by the CMA are Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, the leading supplier of chips for training and using AI. Their involvement in more than 90 partnerships and investments, the CMA said, could limit diversity and choice in the market. The “winner takes all” dynamics of digital markets led to the dominance of a few powerful platforms, Cardell said, and she was “determined to apply the lessons of history” to prevent the same thing from happening again. Highlighting three “interlinked” risks, Cardell said that competition in the AI sector could be harmed by companies that control critical inputs, from data to chips, restricting access to shield themselves from competition; companies using their market power to distort choice in AI services; and partnerships between key players exacerbating concentrations of market power. The CMA first announced its plans to investigate the market in AI foundation models in May 2023. The initial review, published in September, found that people should not expect the technology to have a positive outcome in the world at large.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,631,Shohei Ohtani’s translator reportedly discussing plea deal around alleged $4.5m theft,"Shohei Ohtani’s former translator plans to plead guilty to federal crimes related to the alleged theft of money from the Los Angeles Dodgers star, the New York Times and ESPN reported on Wednesday. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers last month after admitting that he stole at least $4.5m from Ohtani, the biggest star in baseball, to pay off gambling debts. According to the Times and ESPN, Mizuhara’s plea agreement would include an admission that corroborates Ohtani’s version of the events – that the player never wagered on sports, had no idea that Mizuhara did so and was the victim of a “massive theft” by his former friend. A source told ESPN that Ohtani’s story around the events is accurate. MLB players are forbidden from betting on baseball, and face a lifetime ban if found to have placed a wager on their own team. They are allowed to bet on other sports in the nearly 40 US states where gambling is legal, but not in California. Mizuhara’s attorney, Michael G Freedman, declined comment to the Times and ESPN. The alleged theft became public knowledge when wire transfers from Ohtani’s bank account were discovered in a federal investigation of an alleged illegal bookmaker. Mizuhara initially said that Ohtani agreed to cover his gambling debts, then backtracked and admitted that Ohtani was unaware of the payment to the bookie in California. According to the reports, the IRS, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California conducted a joint investigation into Mizuhara’s actions. According to the Times, Mizuhara interacted with law-enforcement officials upon returning from South Korea after the Dodgers’ season-opening trip, but he was not arrested and his current whereabouts are unknown. The Times also says that Mizuhara changed the settings on Ohtani’s bank account so the player would not receive alerts if money was withdrawn. Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers while the team was in South Korea after initially telling the club that Ohtani aided him in paying off his debts. The Times says Ohtani became aware of Mizuhara’s story during a clubhouse meeting conducted in English. Although Ohtani does not speak fluent English, he understood enough of the conversation to confront Mizuhara later. It was at that point that Mizuhara allegedly admitted the theft to Ohtani. Mizuhara had been Ohtani’s translator since the star moved from Japan to play for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, and the pair were close friends as well as having a working relationship. Ohtani joined the Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal, and is one of the most famous people in his homeland.",2024-04-11 11:37:09,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/11/shohei-ohtanis-translator-reportedly-discussing-plea-deal-around-alleged-45m-theft,The Guardian,631,former translator plead guilty federal related theft money star new york time fired last month stole least 45m biggest star baseball pay gambling according time plea agreement would include admission version player never sport idea victim massive theft former friend source told story around accurate forbidden betting baseball face lifetime ban found wager team bet sport nearly 40 u gambling legal attorney g freedman declined comment time theft public knowledge wire bank account discovered federal investigation illegal bookmaker initially said agreed cover gambling admitted unaware payment bookie according department homeland security u office central district joint investigation according time upon south korea trip current whereabouts unknown time also bank account player would receive money withdrawn fired team south korea initially telling club paying time aware story clubhouse meeting although speak fluent understood enough conversation confront later point allegedly admitted theft translator since star japan play 2018 pair close well working relationship 10year 700m deal one famous people homeland translator reportedly plea deal around 45m theft
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,632,Five of the best books about siblings,"From the Marx Brothers to George Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss, siblings have a funny way of stealing the show. In Zadie Smith’s On Beauty, brothers and sisters are the “first evidence” and “last confirmation” of love – but in other books, riding solo wins out. “Part of the joy of being a novelist,” writes Cólm Tóibín, in the LRB essay collection, Sisters Come Second, “is to erase all trace of siblinghood”. The US calendar marks 10 April as National Sibling Day, but Europeans who choose to celebrate have a little longer to wait (it’s 31 May ). A brother, for Baldwin’s narrator, Hall Montana, is both a person and a means of comparison. “One’s little brother begins his life,” he reflects, “within the sturdy gates of one’s imagination … he is everything that you are not … Your life can now be written anew on the empty slate of his.” When that once-little brother is found dead “in a pool of blood”, Hall must relearn what his own life means. Blood and bloodlines dominate Baldwin’s musical, painful final novel. Against a sweeping backdrop of Harlem, Africa and Korea, Baldwin’s cast of siblings, friends and lovers tell a story about the families that are given to us, and the ones we create for ourselves. Set in the 1960s in what was then the German Democratic Republic, this tense, slim autobiographical novel spans three days in the life of Elisabeth, a painter, as she reflects on her relationship with her brother Uli. The narrative flickers between her memories of their childhood, with all its postwar hardship and her agonising realisation that her beloved brother is planning to defect to the west. A brilliant exploration of what happens when “the myth of sibling love” collides with political ideals, rendered in a sparkling new translation by Lucy Jones. A cult 60s coming-of-age tale, Cassandra at the Wedding feels very much of its time. Shades of the phoney-hating Holden Caulfield hover around our cool-eyed narrator, as she heads home to “hook-and-zip” her twin sister into her wedding gown, and “take over the bouquet while she received the ring, through the nose or on the finger”. Cassandra’s penchant for brandy, uppers and angst make for increasingly untethered behaviour, and the novel unfurls like a bacchanalian comedy of errors, with plenty of poolside action.

Literary delights delivered direct you after newsletter promotion Rausing’s account of her brother Hans’s and sister-in-law Eva’s struggles with drug addiction is, in many ways, an ordinary story. The “individuality of addicts”, Rausing writes “is curiously erased by the predictable progress of the disease”. But in this case, the Rausing family’s Tetra Pak fortune, and the grim circumstances around her sister-in-law’s death, created something more seemingly sensational, and her family’s life swiftly became the stuff of tabloid headlines. This is a thoughtful and compelling memoir about guilt, boundaries and the fictions of memory – “the stories that hold a family together, and the acts that can split it apart”. A girl begs the authorities to be allowed to bring her twin brother’s body home. The state resists. The story of Antigone is reshaped here for the 21st century, and on a global stage. This time the actors are not warring factions in Thebes but a young man drawn into Islamic State, his family in the UK, and the press that shapes and moulds their stories. With moving characterisation and elegant prose, Shamsie paints a tragedy of faith, loyalty and family on a grand canvas, but stays true to her all-too human characters.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,633,World’s coal power capacity rises despite climate warnings,"The world’s coal power capacity grew for the first time since 2019 last year, despite warnings that coal plants need to close at a rate of at least 6% each year to avoid a climate emergency. A report by Global Energy Monitor found that coal power capacity grew by 2% last year, driven by an increase in new coal plants across China and a slowdown of plant closures in Europe and the US. About 69.5 gigawatts (GW) of coal plant capacity came online last year, of which two-thirds were built in China, according to the report. There were also plants built in Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Japan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Korea, Greece and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, a slowdown in coal plant shutdowns in the US and Europe led to more than 21GW retiring last year. This resulted in a net annual increase of almost 48.5GW for the year, the highest since 2016. The authors of the report said coal plants needed to shut at a faster pace, and that China needed to adopt stricter controls on its expansion of capacity. Flora Champenois, a Global Energy Monitor analyst, said: “Otherwise we can forget about meeting our goals in the Paris agreement and reaping the benefits that a swift transition to clean energy will bring,.” Climate scientists have said all coal plants should be shut by 2040 – unless they are fitted with effective carbon-removal technology – if governments hope to limit global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels. This would require an average of 126GW of coal plants to retire from the current fleet of 2,130GW every year for the next 17 years, according to the report, or the equivalent of about two plants a week. Champenois described last year’s coal plant expansion as an “anomaly” as more signs point to it “reversing course”. “But countries that have coal plants to retire need to do so more quickly, and countries that have plans for new coal plants must make sure these are never built.” Research by Capital Economics suggests China’s appetite for coal power may reduce as low-carbon options accelerate.

Coal plant retirements were expected to pick up speed across Europe and the US this year, and fewer countries were beginning construction of new plants, Champenois said. The report found that construction started on less than 4GW of new projects outside China last year, a quarter of the annual average between 2015 and 2022 for the same set of countries.",2024-04-11 04:00:20,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/11/worlds-coal-power-capacity-rises-despite-climate-warnings,The Guardian,633,coal power capacity grew first time since 2019 last year despite coal need close rate least 6 year avoid climate emergency report global energy monitor found coal power capacity grew 2 last year driven increase new coal across china slowdown plant u 695 coal plant capacity came last year built china according report also built japan south korea zimbabwe meanwhile slowdown coal plant u led 21gw retiring last year net annual increase almost 485gw year highest since 2016 report said coal shut faster pace china adopt expansion capacity flora global energy monitor analyst said otherwise forget meeting agreement swift transition clean energy bring climate said coal shut 2040 unless fitted effective technology hope limit global heating within 15c would require average 126gw coal retire current fleet 2130gw every year next 17 according report equivalent two week last coal plant expansion anomaly point reversing course coal retire need quickly new coal must make sure never built research capital economics appetite coal power may reduce accelerate sign business today get set working day well point business news analysis need every morning newsletter promotion report found resurgence year combined expansion wind solar nuclear power could mark start steady decline coal demand coal plant pick speed across u year beginning construction new said report found construction le 4gw new outside china last year quarter annual average 2015 2022 set coal power capacity despite climate
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,634,US and Japan announce new military agreements aimed at countering China,"Joe Biden and Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, have announced a new era of military cooperation during the pomp and pageantry of a White House state visit aimed at countering China. The US president said the two nations’ forces will cooperate on a joint command structure and, along with Australia, develop a new air missile defence network. “We’re increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way,” Biden said at a joint press conference with Kishida in the bright sunshine of the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. “This is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since it was first established. “I’m also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile and defence architecture. We’re also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.” The president, born a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that prompted US entry into the second world war, said the agreements set a “new benchmark for our military cooperation”. The move appears aimed at making US and Japanese forces more nimble in the event of a crisis such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden insisted that it was “purely defensive” and “not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region”. Kishida told reporters that the two leaders had discussed tense relations between Taiwan and China and pledged to uphold international order based on the rule of law. “We confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable,” Kishida said. The US and Japan will continue to respond to such actions, including challenges from China, he added. “Regarding Russia’s aggression of Ukraine, based on a recognition that Ukraine today may be east Asia tomorrow.” The leaders also announced deals for technology, including artificial intelligence and the economy, along with a joint partnership to accelerate development and commercialisation of nuclear fusion. Biden said they had a shared goal that a Japanese person will be the first non-American to walk on the moon, flying on a US mission due to take place in a few years’ time. Japan is taking on a more prominent global role after a series of security law changes in the past decade that have transformed its pacifist constitution. Biden also noted that Japan is the top foreign investor in the US. Overall the US and Japan have struck about 70 agreements on defence cooperation, including moves to upgrade the US military command structure in Japan, the biggest such change since the 1960s. The two sides will set up a forum for the co-development and co-production of missiles and maintenance of US warships and aircraft, as well as a working group for fighter pilot training and co-development and co-production of jet trainers.

Asked if there was a path for Japan to become a full member of Aukus, Kishida replied: “We want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region and therefore we have consistently supported Aukus … But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with Aukus, nothing has been decided at this moment.” Kishida is the first Japanese leader to get a US state visit since Shinzo Abe in 2015 and only the fifth world leader to receive one since Biden took office in 2021. The dinner was held in the grand East Room of the White House, decorated by fans and cherry blossom branches. White House chefs served a meal featuring Japanese flavors, starting with house-cured salmon, followed by dry-aged ribeye with wasabi sauce, and salted caramel pistachio cake with cherry ice-cream. After dinner, singer Paul Simon performed hits while playing guitar, including Graceland and Slip Slidin’ Away. Simon is one of Jill Biden’s favourite artists, according to the White House. At the dinner, Kishida quoted from the science fiction series Star Trek, telling guests “I would like to propose a toast to our voyage to the frontier of the Japan-US relationship with this word: boldly go,” a phrase from the iconic opening monologue of the TV series. Other notable guests at the dinner included Bill and Hillary Clinton and actor Robert De Niro. Kishida will address Congress on Thursday and join Biden and the Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, for a meeting expected to focus on Beijing’s South China Sea incursions. Biden also expressed support for Japan’s attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea. “We welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea,” he commented. “As I’ve said many times, we’re open to dialogue ourselves at any time but without preconditions from the DPRK.”",2024-04-10 22:03:23,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/us-japan-military-agreement,The Guardian,634,joe prime minister new era military pomp pageantry white house state visit china u president said two joint command structure along develop new air missile defence network increasing work together seamless effective way said joint press conference bright sunshine white house rose garden significant upgrade alliance since first established also announce first time japan united create system air missile defence architecture also looking forward standing trilateral military exercise japan united kingdom president born year attack pearl harbor u entry second world war said set new military move making u nimble event crisis invasion purely defensive one nation threat region told two tense china uphold international order based rule law confirmed unilateral change status quo force coercion absolutely unacceptable said u japan continue respond china added regarding aggression based recognition today may east tomorrow also technology artificial intelligence economy along joint partnership accelerate development nuclear fusion said goal person first walk moon flying u mission due take place time japan taking prominent global role series security law past decade pacifist constitution also noted japan top foreign investor u overall u japan struck 70 defence upgrade u military command structure japan biggest change since 1960s two side set forum maintenance u aircraft well working group fighter pilot training jet sign first thing u morning briefing key day telling whats happening newsletter promotion joint statement said defence partnership considering japan advanced quantum undersea hypersonic artificial intelligence technology path japan become full member want contribute peace stability region therefore consistently … japan direct nothing decided moment first leader get u state visit since 2015 fifth world leader receive one since took office 2021 dinner grand east room white house decorated cherry blossom white house meal starting salmon wasabi sauce salted caramel pistachio cake cherry dinner singer guitar slip away one according white house dinner science fiction series star trek telling would like propose toast voyage frontier relationship word boldly go phrase iconic opening monologue series notable dinner included bill actor de address congress join president meeting focus south china sea also expressed support set summit north korea welcome opportunity ally initiate dialogue democratic republic korea said many time open dialogue time without u japan announce new military china
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,635,Appeal court judge denies Trump’s third attempt this week to delay hush money trial – as it happened,"The appeals court judge, just moments after the hearing wrapped up in New York this afternoon, has ruled against Donald Trump’s third attempt this week to delay his hush-money criminal trial Trump was denied his attempt to push back his 15 April trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, paving the way for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, Reuters reports. During an earlier hearing, Trump lawyer Emil Bove said the trial should be delayed because justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the case, has not yet ruled on their request for him to recuse himself. Bove also said Merchan was wrong to deny their request to bar prosecutors from presenting Trump’s tweets during his 2017-2021 presidential term as evidence. Bove said presidential immunity should prevent the prosecutors from presenting those posts as evidence. At the hearing before associate justice Ellen Gesmer at a mid-level state appeals court called the appellate division, Bove said: We are scheduled to begin trial under circumstances that will violate President Trump’s rights. Steven Wu, a lawyer for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, said Trump’s lawyers had brought the requests too late, saying: There is a powerful public interest in ensuring that this criminal trial go forward. An appeals court judge in New York denied Donald Trump’s third attempt in three days to delay his hush-money criminal trial. Trump was denied his attempt to push back the 15 April trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, paving the way for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president. Donald Trump said he believes the Arizona supreme court went too far with its ruling upholding a near-total abortion ban. Asked if he would sign a national abortion ban if elected president in 2024, Trump said: “No.” In response, the Biden campaign said Trump “owns the suffering and chaos happening right now” and warned that he has banned abortion “every chance he gets”. Asked what he would say to the people of Arizona, Joe Biden said: “Elect me. I’m in the … 21st century, not back then.” Biden also said he is “considering” a request from Australia to end the prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Kamala Harris will visit Arizona on Friday as part of her nationwide reproductive freedoms tour. The White House said Harris would highlight “extremists” in the state who are pushing for abortion bans during her visit. Democrats in Florida are teaming up with operatives from Biden’s re-election campaign in an all-out assault on Republicans’ extremist positions on abortion, believing it will bring victory in presidential and Senate races in November. The House voted to block the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a high-profile warrantless surveillance program that is now in limbo before a 19 April expiration date. House speaker Mike Johnson will meet on Friday with Donald Trump for a press conference on “election integrity” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, a Trump campaign official said. Johnson met with Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Wednesday, marking the first time the two have spoken since Greene filed a motion to vacate the speakership late last month. Greene described the meeting as “passionate”. The independent presidential candidate Cornel West announced that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate, joining the former Harvard professor’s long-shot bid in the US presidential race. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, told donors and supporters last weekend that he would help raise money for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, according to multiple reports. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, is accused of covering up a $130,000 hush-money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006, Reuters neatly recaps. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and denies any such encounter with Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan has not yet ruled on Trump’s motion for him to recuse himself. The defense has argued that the judge’s daughter’s work for a political consulting firm with Democratic clients poses a conflict of interest. On Monday, a judge at the appellate division denied Trump’s request to delay the case while he pursues a challenge to the trial being held in heavily Democratic Manhattan. On Tuesday, another judge rejected his bid to pause the trial while he appeals Merchan’s decision to impose a gag order restricting his public statements about potential witnesses, court staff, lawyers and family members of the judge and district attorney Alvin Bragg. Those appeals will still be heard by a full panel.

The hearing is over at the appeals court in New York where lawyers for Donald Trump are making the argument for the third time in three days that his hush-money criminal trial should be delayed. Jury selection will begin on Monday, so time is running out for Trump. We await the court’s decision. As colleague Cameron Joseph wrote earlier today, this follows a longstanding pattern of Trump freaking out as major threats approach, and his team responding with frenetic energy. Trump’s team throws everything it can at the wall, while Trump continues his tirade against presiding judge Juan Merchan – while pushing the bounds of the judge’s gag order.

Lawyers for Donald Trump have been back in court for almost the last hour trying to stave off the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, which begins on Monday. In a more technical legal take from NBC, the TV network explains the following: The court docket for the state Appellate Division shows Trump’s attorneys filed the challenge as a lawsuit invoking a provision of New York law known as Article 78. Article 78 challenges allow litigants, whether in ongoing litigation or otherwise, to seek relief from allegedly unlawful state or local government action. The documents were filed under seal. The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting the case, said it involved Judge Juan Merchan’s refusal to step aside from presiding over the case. Lawyers for former President Trump head back to a New York appeals court with their third legal challenge involving his impending criminal trial in three days. https://t.co/kBDIs74KWC Trump is a defendant in four criminal cases, two federal and two state. The hush-money case in New York is first up. The Georgia election interference case, the federal election interference case and the federal classified documents case do not have trial dates yet. The presidential election is on 5 November and Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee, prior to his expected anointment at the Republican National Convention this summer. Donald Trump’s lawyers told a New York appeals court judge on Wednesday that the former US president’s 15 April trial should be delayed because the judge has not yet ruled on their motion for him to recuse himself, in his third last-ditch attempt so far this week to delay the case, Reuters reports. The Republican presidential candidate is accused of covering up a $130,000 hush-money payment his former lawyer Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence ahead of the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006.

Those appeals will still be heard by a full panel. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the trial on Monday. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, told donors and supporters last weekend that he would help raise money for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, according to multiple reports. DeSantis, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race in January, told his allies about his plans to help his former rival during a private gathering at the Hard Rock Hotel in south Florida, a DeSantis adviser told NBC News. DeSantis is “committed to helping Trump in any and every way”, said Texas businessman Roy Bailey, who attended the retreat. He said: I will follow the governor’s lead and I will do anything that he or President Trump ask me to do to help him win this election. A Trump campaign adviser said they were not aware that the Florida governor was going to start raising money for them but added that “everyone should be working towards defeating Joe Biden and electing President Trump”, NBC reported. Joe Biden, during a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, at the White House, said Japan’s attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea is “a good thing” as he reiterated his administration’s willingness for its own talks without preconditions. Biden said: We welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. As I’ve said many times, we’re open to dialogue ourselves without preconditions with the DPRK. The Biden administration has repeatedly expressed openness to talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but has never received a response. House speaker Mike Johnson will meet on Friday with Donald Trump for a press conference on “election integrity”, a Trump campaign official said. The press conference is scheduled to take place at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, AP reported, citing a source as saying that Johnson and Trump will have a “joint announcement” on Friday. NEWS w/ @KristenhCNN:  Speaker Mike Johnson is making plans to deliver a joint press conference with Donald Trump  at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, focused on ""election integrity,"" per sources.Plans still fluid, but comes as Johnson is facing a threat to his speakership from MTG. When the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, Republicans across the country cheered. Freed from Roe’s regulations, GOP lawmakers promptly blanketed the US south and midwest in near-total abortion bans. But today, after a string of electoral losses, stories of women being denied abortions and polls that confirm abortion bans remain wildly unpopular, the political calculus has changed. Republicans are now trying to slow down the car whose brakes they cut – and to convince voters that, if the car crashes, they had nothing to do with it anyway. Nowhere encapsulates the GOP’s backpedal on abortion better than Arizona, whose state supreme court on Tuesday ruled to let an 1864 near-total abortion ban go into effect. That ban, which outlaws abortion in all cases except to save the life of a woman, was passed before Arizona became a state, before the end of the civil war and before women gained the right to vote. Read the full analysis by the Guardian’s reproductive health and justice reporter: Arizona’s abortion ban is a political nightmare for Republicans in the 2024 election The House has voted to block the reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a high-profile warrantless surveillance program that is now in limbo ahead of a 19 April expiration date. House Republicans have been fiercely divided over how to handle the issue, and Wednesday’s vote comes months after a similar process to reform and reauthorize the program fell apart before it even reached the House floor. The law allows the US government to collect the communications of targeted foreigners abroad by compelling service providers to produce copies of messages and internet data, or networks to intercept and turn over phone call and message data. It is controversial because it allows the government to incidentally collect messages and phone data of Americans without a court order if they interacted with the foreign target, even though the law prohibits section 702 from being used by the National Security Agency to specifically target US citizens. Joe Biden was asked what he would say to the people of Arizona following the state supreme court’s ruling to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect. The president, referring to the 1864 abortion ban which passed when Arizona was still a territory, replied: Elect me. I’m in the 20th century … 21st century … not back then. They weren’t even a state. From the Washington Post’s JM Rieger: REPORTER: On the issue of abortion, what do you say to the people of Arizona right now...?BIDEN: Elect me. I'm in the 20th century — 21st century, not back then. They weren't even a state. pic.twitter.com/0T2ASk1E0w Cornel West’s announcement that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate comes as West, an author and leftwing activist, continues his efforts to get on the ballot in every US state. West’s campaign said he had already secured ballot access in Alaska, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah, but some states require a running mate for independent candidates to get on the ballot. As part of his 50-state campaign, West announced in January that he would launch a new political party, called the Justice for All party, to help ease his path to ballot access in some states. West has no path to victory, as national polls show his support languishing in the low single digits. A survey conducted last month by the Marquette Law School found that just 4% of likely US voters named West as their preferred candidate. But West’s presence on the ballot in key battleground states could draw support away from Joe Biden, raising concerns among Democrats that the independent candidate might serve as a spoiler for the incumbent president. According to a Quinnipiac University poll of US voters conducted last month, Biden leads Donald Trump by three points, 48% to 45%, in a head-to-head match-up, but the president’s support dipped down to 38% (compared with Trump’s 39%) when third-party candidates such as West, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Jill Stein of the Green party were listed as options. The independent presidential candidate Cornel West announced on Wednesday that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate, joining the former Harvard professor’s long-shot bid in the US presidential race. Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, helped to form the LA chapter of the group Black Lives Matter, and West praised her as “one of the great freedom fighters of her generation”. West told the talkshow host Tavis Smiley on Wednesday"": I wanted somebody whose heart, mind and soul is committed to the empowerment of poor and working peoples of all colors. And Melina has a history of longevity, of putting her heart, mind, soul and body in the struggle. Abdullah told Smiley that West’s offer took her by surprise, but she quickly accepted because of her belief in his “platform of truth, love and justice”. “How can you not get behind that platform?” Abdullah said. So I’ve been following him and had been really enthusiastic about his candidacy and just was excited to be able to share space with him. Democrats in Florida are teaming up with operatives from Joe Biden’s re-election campaign in an all-out assault on Republicans’ extremist positions on abortion, believing it will bring victory in presidential and Senate races in November. They fired an opening salvo on Tuesday, tearing into Donald Trump’s “boasting” about overturning federal abortion protections a day earlier, and assailing the incumbent Republican senator Rick Scott for supporting Florida’s six-week ban that takes effect next month. Ron DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor and former candidate for the party’s presidential nomination who signed the ban into law, also found himself under fire. The Florida supreme court ruled last week that the six-week ban will take effect on 1 May, as well as allowing a ballot measure for November that could see voters enshrine the right to the procedure into law. The moves instantly propelled the state to the forefront of the national abortion debate, and allowed Democrats, all but wiped out in Florida in successive national elections, to seize on the issue as vote-winner. Biden’s campaign has released a statement following Trump’s criticism of the Arizona abortion ban, warning that he has previously “[banned] abortion every chance he gets”. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign said that Trump will enact a national abortion ban given his track record, adding that the former president “proudly overturned Roe”. Donald Trump owns the suffering and chaos happening right now, including in Arizona, because he proudly overturned Roe – something he called ‘“an incredible thing’” and ‘“pretty amazing’” just today. Trump lies constantly – about everything – but has one track record: banning abortion every chance he gets. The guy who wants to be a dictator on day one will use every tool at his disposal to ban abortion nationwide, with or without Congress, and running away from reporters to his private jet like a coward doesn’t change that reality. Greene added that Johnson asked if she was “interested” in being apart of a group of advisers for him. Green said: I said, ‘I’ll wait and see what his proposal is on that.’ Right now. he does not have my support, and I’m watching what happens with FISA and Ukraine. Greene added that she told Johnson he “failed” on the latest government spending dealing and received “a lot of excuses” in return. Rep. MTG after Johnson meeting says she explained her positions on FISA, Ukraine aid and how he “failed” them on the govt spending dealSays she got a “lot of excuses” of how that happened Greene said he discussed having a kitchen cabinet group that would be a group of advisers for him and asked her if she  “was interested.”“I said, ‘I'll wait and see what his proposal is on that.’ Right now. he does not have my support, and I'm watching what happens with FISA… https://t.co/V7LMlxGCTt The House speaker, Mike Johnson, and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene have concluded their meeting, with varying descriptions on how it went. The meeting, which lasted over an hour, came after Greene filed a motion to vacate the speakership. Greene described the meeting as “passionate”, NBC News reported. When asked if the meeting was “productive”, Greene said: He’d have to completely change everything he’s done to be productive. Meanwhile, Johnson gave a more diplomatic answer, calling Greene a “friend” even as the two Republicans have differed on “strategy”. She’s a colleague. I’ve always considered her a friend … Marjorie and I don’t disagree on philosophy. We’re both conservatives. Sometimes we disagree on strategy. From Punchbowl News’ Mica Soellner: MTG on if she would describe the Johnson meeting as productive: ""He'd have to completely change everything he's done to be productive."" JOHNSON on MTG meeting today: ""She's a colleague. I've always considered her a friend... Marjorie and I don't disagree on philosophy. We're both conservatives. Sometimes we disagree on strategy."" Trump also said that he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected president in 2024, ABC News reported. Trump further clarified his position while speaking with reporters on Wednesday. In response to the question of if he would sign an abortion ban, Trump said “no” and shook his head. Trump says that Arizona’s abortion ruling went too far: “Yeah they did, and that will be straightened out.” Also tells @ABC he wouldn’t sign a national abortion ban as president.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,636,Idaho teen arrested for alleged plans to attack churches in name of Islamic State,"An Idaho teenager who was allegedly planning an attack on churches in the name of Islamic State has been arrested. Last Saturday, federal authorities arrested 18-year-old Alexander Scott Mercurio of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, a day before his alleged planned attack on churches in the city using weapons including knives, firearms and fire. The federal investigation into Mercurio began when he allegedly reached out to confidential human sources online and indicated his support for IS, according to a criminal complaint. Unbeknown to him, Mercurio detailed his support to an FBI informant. In addition to spreading IS propaganda online, Mercurio allegedly solicited the terror organization’s involvement in and approval of his propaganda efforts, as well as discussed traveling from the US to join IS. In what federal authorities believe to be an online message from Mercurio to a group chat on an “encrypted social media and mobile messaging electronic communication service”, the teenager allegedly wrote in October 2022: “I’m 17 in USA…I know I try to keep secret, I’m in north Idaho very Christian and conservative parents are mad cause I’m not shaving beard and not letting pants go below ankle.” Mercurio also allegedly wrote: “Okay brother it was calm for a couple days, now its serious. They’re sending me to in person school again more therapy more stuff like that etc etc probably not coming back anytime soon. Obviously make dua, tell brothers, etc. Im in for the long haul. I gotta keep my Iman firm, no matter what. They may even send me to a ‘youth program’ (ship me off hundreds of miles to force me to ‘behave’) etv etc. Kinda scared but In Sha Allah everything will be okay, goodbye brother.” In addition to his alleged online messages, federal authorities also found “numerous files confirming Mercurio’s commitment to IS and its ideology” on his school-issued laptop. Those files allegedly include a picture of him wearing a black balaclava and holding up the number one finger, a gesture commonly used by IS supporters, as well as documents concerning the Norwegian neo-Nazi terrorist Anders Breivik, US school massacres, the suicide epidemic in Japan and Korea, as well as austerity suicides in Europe. Mercurio also allegedly considered and planned ways to support IS financially. He is accused of planning to assault his father with a metal pipe, acquire his father’s firearms and attack up to approximately 21 churches. The criminal complaint reveals that at the beginning of this year, Mercurio allegedly planned to carry out his suicide attack on a church in Coeur d’Alene on 7 April, a date “intentionally selected by him so his attack would occur before the end of Ramadan”. The complaint also says his plan involved using “flame-covered weapons”, explosives, knives, a machete, a pipe and firearms. As the date of his planned attack drew near, Mercurio also allegedly devised a plan to incapacitate his father, restrain him with handcuffs and steal his firearms “to use for maximum casualties in his attack”. In planning the attack, Mercurio also allegedly made a ba’yah, or an Islamic pledge of allegiance, to IS and stated his intention to die while killing others in the name of the terror organization. In a statement released following Mercurio’s arrest, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said: “Thanks to the investigative efforts of the FBI, the defendant was taken into custody before he could act, and he is now charged with attempting to support Isis’s mission of terror and violence. The justice department will continue to relentlessly pursue, disrupt, and hold accountable those who would commit acts of terrorism against the people and interests of the United States.” Echoing similar sentiments, Shohini Sinha, special agent in charge of the Salt Lake City FBI, said: “This case should be an eye-opener to the dangers of self-radicalization, which is a real threat to our communities. Protecting the American people from terrorism remains the FBI’s number one priority, and we continue to encourage the public to report anything suspicious to the FBI or your local law enforcement.” Mercurio is charged with attempting to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, Mercurio faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison.",2024-04-10 19:26:31,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/idaho-isis-teen-attack,The Guardian,636,allegedly attack name state last federal 18yearold day attack city fire federal investigation allegedly confidential human support according criminal complaint unbeknown detailed support informant addition spreading propaganda allegedly solicited terror involvement approval propaganda well traveling u join federal believe message group chat social medium mobile electronic communication service allegedly wrote 2022 17 … know try keep secret north conservative mad cause shaving beard pant go ankle also allegedly wrote brother calm couple day serious theyre sending person school therapy stuff like probably coming back soon obviously make tell long haul keep firm matter may even send youth program ship force behave sha everything brother addition federal also found numerous confirming commitment ideology allegedly include picture wearing black balaclava holding number one finger gesture commonly used well concerning terrorist u school suicide epidemic japan korea well austerity also allegedly considered way support financially accused assault father metal pipe acquire attack approximately 21 criminal complaint beginning year allegedly carry suicide attack church 7 date intentionally selected attack would occur end complaint also plan involved machete pipe date attack drew near also allegedly plan incapacitate father restrain steal use maximum attack attack also allegedly made pledge allegiance stated intention die killing name terror organization statement following arrest u attorney general garland said thanks investigative defendant taken custody could act support mission terror violence justice department continue relentlessly pursue disrupt hold accountable would commit terrorism people united similar special agent charge salt lake city said case real threat protecting people terrorism remains number one priority continue encourage public report anything suspicious local law enforcement provide material support foreign terrorist organization maximum penalty 20 federal prison teen attack name state
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,637,"Aggressive use of state subsidies risks expensive trade wars, IMF warns","Aggressive use of industrial policy by the world’s most powerful economies risks becoming an expensive mistake that could trigger a tit-for-tat subsidy war, the International Monetary Fund has said. In a warning shot to governments around the world, the IMF said attempts to increase innovation only worked under certain limited conditions and were not a “magic cure” for slow growth. Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department, said: “History shows that getting industrial policy right can be a tall order, and there are many cautionary tales of policy mistakes, high fiscal costs and negative spillovers to other countries.” It comes as leading western governments adopt an increasingly interventionist approach to boosting economic growth, gradually turning away from a reliance on the private sector, low taxes and the light-touch regulation built up over the past four decades. In a sign of increasing tensions over industrial policy, Beijing has accused the EU of protectionism after Brussels launched a subsidy investigation into Chinese wind turbine companies. “China is highly concerned about the discriminatory measures taken by the European Union against Chinese companies and even industries,” the country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. The EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, announced an investigation on Tuesday into whether Chinese companies involved in wind farms across Europe may have benefited from support from Beijing. While careful to avoid singling out any country for criticism, the IMF used a chapter from its half-yearly fiscal monitor to express scepticism about the benefits claimed for industrial strategies and urged rich countries to concentrate on support for underfunded basic research. It said recent initiatives – such as the Chips Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the US, the Green Deal Industrial Plan in the EU, the New Direction on Economy and Industrial Policy in Japan, and the K-Chips Act in Korea – as well as longstanding policies in large emerging market economies such as China were alike in having a strong emphasis on innovation in specific sectors. Most packages involve governments offering tax and subsidy incentives for investment in green and advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Dabla-Norris said the resurgence in industrial policy was motivated by concerns about economic and energy security, and the hope that it would re-ignite productivity growth, which has been weak in many parts of the world since the global financial crisis of 2008. Using industrial policy to promote innovation was only worth it if the benefits could be well identified and measured, and the subsidies were provided to sectors that generated higher knowledge spillovers to other sectors, Dabla-Norris said. Gains could be particularly high in the case of innovation that accelerated the development of green technologies to lower carbon emissions. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion However, she feared activist government policies could lead to “misallocation of resources and capture by special interests”, because most approaches relied heavily on costly subsidies. “Potential gains could quickly run into sizeable losses,” she said. “Further, we show that discriminating against foreign firms can actually prove self-defeating, as such policies can trigger costly retaliation in most countries. Even major advanced economies rely on innovation that is done elsewhere.” The IMF said in technologically advanced economies, a more cost-effective way to increase innovation and growth was a mix of public funding for fundamental research, research and development grants for innovative startups, and tax incentives to encourage applied innovation across firms. “We estimate that increasing spending on these policies by 0.5 percentage points of gross domestic product – or about 50% of the current level in OECD economies – could raise GDP by up to 2% for the average advanced economy. That level of spending on innovation could even reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the long term.”",2024-04-10 13:30:10,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/10/industrial-policy-to-boost-innovation-not-magic-cure-for-slow-growth-imf-warns,The Guardian,637,aggressive use industrial policy powerful becoming expensive mistake could trigger subsidy war international monetary fund said warning shot around world said increase innovation worked certain limited magic cure slow growth era deputy director fiscal department said history getting industrial policy right tall order many cautionary tale policy high fiscal negative come leading western adopt increasingly interventionist approach economic growth gradually turning away reliance private sector low regulation built past four sign increasing industrial policy accused eu protectionism subsidy investigation wind turbine china highly concerned discriminatory taken union even foreign ministry mao said competition commissioner investigation whether involved wind across may support careful avoid country criticism used chapter fiscal monitor express industrial rich concentrate support basic research said recent chip act inflation reduction act u green deal industrial plan eu new direction economy industrial policy japan act korea well large market china alike strong emphasis innovation specific involve offering tax subsidy investment green advanced artificial intelligence said resurgence industrial policy economic energy security hope would reignite productivity growth weak many world since global financial crisis 2008 industrial policy promote innovation worth could well measured provided higher knowledge said gain could particularly high case innovation accelerated development green lower carbon sign business today get set working day well point business news analysis need every morning newsletter promotion however feared activist government could lead capture special heavily costly potential gain could quickly run sizeable said show discriminating foreign actually prove trigger costly retaliation even major advanced rely innovation done elsewhere said technologically advanced way increase innovation growth mix public fundamental research research development innovative tax encourage applied innovation across estimate increasing spending 05 percentage gross domestic product 50 current level could raise 2 average advanced economy level spending innovation could even reduce ratio long term aggressive use state expensive trade
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,638,Eric Abetz handed senior Tasmanian cabinet roles – as it happened,"We’re going to leave it here for the day. Here’s what happened: Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff has reached an agreement with the Jacqui Lambie Network to form government, with JLN members Miriam Beswick, Andrew Jenner, and Rebekah Pentland agreeing to provide confidence to his government on a number of measures. Former federal Coalition senator Eric Abetz has been named Tasmanian minister for business, industry and resources, which includes salmon and forestry. Abetz will also be minister for transport, and the leader of the government in the lower house. The Coalition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has said “we are seeing breakouts of strategic disorder across the globe” and accused the Albanese government of being “weak at articulating the threats we face”. A Melbourne council in the city’s west says asbestos has been discovered at Altona Coastal Park, as the discovery of contaminated material spreads to seven parks across the city. Thanks for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow to take you through all the news Thursday has to offer. The conservative Liberal will have responsibility for contentious salmon farms and native forest logging in Tasmania after being appointed to senior roles in Jeremy Rockliff‘s new cabinet. The former federal Coalition senator has been named the state minister for business, industry and resources, which includes salmon and forestry. Abetz will also be minister for transport, and the leader of the government in the lower house as the Rockliff government attempts to navigate a parliament in which it holds only 14 of 35 seats. The announcement of the cabinet followed the Liberals reaching an agreement with the state’s three new Jacqui Lambie Network MPs - Miriam Beswick, Andrew Jenner and Rebekah Pentland. JLN promised to back the Liberals on confidence and censure votes that did not involve “malfeasance or corruption” and guaranteed to support all budget bills. The minor party also said it would give the government notice if it intended to vote against any of its legislation, and then vote for an adjournment so the parties could negotiate. Rockliff still needs a deal on confidence votes with at least one of the state’s three independent MPs – Craig Garland, Kristie Johnston and David O’Byrne – to reach the 18 votes needed in parliament. Greens leader calls on government to ‘immediately recognise Palestine’ Posting on social media site X, Adam Bandt also said the government should “end military exports and stop military contracts with Israel, and stop backing the invasion”. The Labor government should immediately recognise Palestine.Labor must also end military exports & stop military contracts with Israel, and stop backing the invasion.No need to wait. There’s no barrier to this happening right now. Qatar Airways avoids Australian lawsuit The airline has dodged legal action over an incident at Doha airport in which women were forcibly removed from planes by armed guards and some intimately examined. However, while the federal court dismissed the case against the airline, justice John Halley determined the five Australian women bringing the case could instead re-plead their claims for damages against Matar, a Qatar Airways-owned subsidiary engaged by the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) to run Doha airport. The five women initiated legal action against the airline in 2022, later adding the QCAA and Matar to the case over the incident in October 2020, seeking damages over “unlawful physical contact”, false imprisonment and mental health impacts, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. They were among more than a dozen passengers who were escorted off the Sydney-bound Qatar Airways plane by armed guards as authorities searched for the mother of a newborn baby found abandoned in a plastic bag at Hamad international airport. The infant survived. The women were taken to ambulances on the tarmac and some were forced to submit to invasive examinations for evidence they had recently given birth. The lawsuit claims one passenger was forced to undergo a strip-search holding her five-month-old son. Tammy Tyrrell, the Tasmanian senator who spectacularly quit the Jacqui Lambie Network before the Easter weekend, has likened the deterioration of her relationship with Lambie and the minor party to a marriage breakdown. Tyrell told ABC on Wednesday afternoon she had made the decision to “rip the Band-Aid off and separate” with the minor party after it became clear they were no longer happy with her. “If someone is not happy in a relationship, and it is made obvious they are not happy with the way the other person in the relationship is representing them, someone has to make a decision. I said before that the people of Tasmania are the children in this relationship and they will be looked after fabulously.” Asked whether there was tension or a “blow up” between the two Tasmanians, Tyrell said she would not speak badly about the senator she once worked for as an office manager. I would love to say there was a huge drama but, in any relationship, there are highs and lows and in all honesty, we’re not really in a low, we are just travelling the course of our relationship. Jacqui and I wish each other well. We’re not going to do anything different in that we are going to try and get the best for Tasmania with the legislation. We will work together moving forward. And I will never speak badly about them. Tyrell was also asked about the role of the minor party’s board in her resignation. The now independent senator said there was nothing murky about the board she had sat on before resigning. We are new to the political game but we were not silly so we knew we had to make sure that the network was protected and a board was created. But if you speak to Jacqui or another senator I am sure they would be happy to explain more. Barnaby Joyce is criticising delays in implementing a new system of compensation and rehabilitation for veterans, the draft legislation of which he says was initially meant to be released in 2023. He says the legislation, which is meant to combine the three current acts that govern these issues – the veterans entitlement act, the military act, and defence rehabilitation act – “was supposed to go through or be complete in 2025. Now they are saying it won’t be complete until 2026. They might not even be the government then.” Joyce says it’s important that Australians know the context of this issue, in understanding his frustration: Since 1997 about 1600 Australian ex-servicemen and women have committed suicide … If that happened in a number of plane crashes, we will be having royal commission after royal commission, so this is incredibly important. These people have served our nation. Joyce calls for peace before statehood discussion on Israel and Palestine Barnaby Joyce has said “it’s not the right time and it’s not the place” to be having a discussion about recognising a Palestinian state. “The only thing we should be discussing is how we bring about peace,” he has told the ABC. At this point in time, Gaza is run by a terrorist organisation called Hamas and so a plan to create a separate terrorist state, how does that work? Obviously we would want, as things progress, for Israel and the Palestinians to come to an arrangement which brings peace over the longer term and that’s what everybody wants … Nobody wants what is happening there at the moment. It is a complete and utter human tragedy but the source of this, the instigator of this, was a terrorist organisation and you cannot start saying I’m going to open up negotiations with a terrorist organisation. Is Australia going to have diplomatic relations with a terrorist organisation representatives of the Gaza Strip? Concern among LGBTQ+ groups about Cass review findings into trans healthcare practices in UK The findings of a major review of trans healthcare practices in the UK have been met with deep concern by Australian LGBTQ+ organisations, with “caution and care” urged in local interpretations of it. The Cass review – named for Dr Hilary Cass, the paediatrician commissioned to conduct a review of the services provided by the UK health system to children and young people exploring their gender identity – found gender medicine was “built on shaky foundations” and that there was a dearth of robust data in the field. Representatives from Equality Australia, the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH), Acon, the Trans Justice Project and more, said the review “ignores the consensus of major medical bodies around the world and lacks relevance within an Australian context”. The director of community health at Acon, Teddy Cook, said: Trans people everywhere should have access to the highest attainable level of health through a robust, evidence based, multi-disciplinary and affirming approach, an approach that demonstrably saves trans lives. In ignoring key evidence and research, the Cass review does not meet that standard and has today let down the very people, families, health providers and communities it seeks to support. LGBTIQ+ Health Australia has urged local institutions to “hold the report at arm’s length” and ensure that it is not used “to drive extremist responses … that do more harm than good” to trans healthcare, such as the withdrawal of puberty blockers from trans and gender-diverse young people. LGBTIQ+ Health Australia chief executive Nicky Bath said: The report itself acknowledges that the review is marred by poor quality data and flawed methodologies, which in and of itself, calls into question the validity of the report’s conclusions … We call on the Australian government to stand by trans and gender diverse young people, listen to them, their families, organisations and clinicians and resist the pressure that will come to withdraw access to puberty blockers and instead support affirming care practices that respects children-centred care, the autonomy and dignity of transgender and gender-diverse people. Claims flowing in to insurance firms Insurers have received 11,527 claims to date from last weekend’s severe storm in New South Wales, the Insurance Council of Australia has reported. Most of these claims related to damage to buildings and contents as a result of wind and heavy rain causing gutters to overflow and flash flooding to occur. The ICA said that at this stage it was too early to estimate the insurance damage bill, which most severely affected the Hawkesbury-Nepean and Illawarra regions of New South Wales. The ICA’s advice to people whose property has been affected by storm-related damage is: If property or a vehicle have been affected, customers are advised to contact their insurer as soon as possible to commence the claims process even if they do not know the full extent of damage. Insurance customers are not required to keep destroyed property, including carpets and furnishings, and should instead take photos, note any identifying information, and keep materials samples. New data also released today shows that losses from declared insurance catastrophes this summer have reached close to $1.6bn, with the cost of the Christmas storms now exceeding $1.1bn. What did Penny Wong say about recognising Palestinian statehood – and is Australia at odds with its allies? The Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, has said a “pathway out of the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East can only come with recognition of “a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel”. Some commentators have interpreted the speech as a hint that Australia could recognise Palestinian statehood in the near term. So what did Wong actually say about a two-state solution, what was she silent about, and how does this fit in with what Australia’s allies are doing? Daniel Hurst has this excellent explainer: Icac concludes probe of former Labor minister’s conduct The New South Wales corruption watchdog has ended its investigation into former Labor minister Tim Crakanthorp after concluding there were “no reasonable prospects” of finding his conduct corrupt. Crakanthorp was sacked from cabinet last August after it was revealed the Newcastle MP had allegedly failed to declare “substantial private family holdings” relating to his wife’s family. Neither Crakanthorp’s wife nor her family were accused of any wrongdoing. The premier, Chris Minns, referred the matter to the Independent Commission Against Corruption after asking Crakanthorp to resign as a minister after he became aware of the properties across the Hunter region, for which he was the minister. A spokesperson for the Icac on Wednesday said: As the Commission is satisfied that there are no reasonable prospects of finding Mr Crakanthorp’s conduct is sufficiently serious to justify a finding of corrupt conduct, it has terminated its investigation. Hi, Kate Lyons here, I’ll be taking you through the rest of the day’s news. To start us off, AAP have an update after the late-breaking news yesterday that Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art have lost a legal battle over its Ladies Lounge exhibit. The artist behind the Ladies Lounge said she is deeply saddened after the exhibit was found to be unlawful. A case was brought against the operators of Mona in the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal by Jason Lau, who was refused access to the lounge, because only women are allowed entry. The Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal decision ruled on Tuesday that Kirsha Kaechele’s artwork may have had a point but violated the law. The women-only, curtained-off lounge now has 28 days to allow “persons who do not identify as ladies” access to the installation. Ms Kaechele posted on Instagram on Wednesday that she was “saddened by the court’s ruling against the Ladies Lounge”. “But, by grace of due process, I have been granted a 28-day period. This allows me space to absorb the situation, seek counsel and compose myself,” she wrote. “I am so grateful for your ongoing understanding and support through one of the most difficult periods of my life. Such periods can be painful, as many of us know.” A MONA spokesperson said the museum is taking time to figure out its next steps. “We are deeply disappointed by this decision. We will take some time to absorb the result and consider our options,” she said. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Kate Lyons will be here to guide you through the rest of our rolling coverage. Take care! China calls US remarks on Taiwan ‘very dangerous’ Reuters is reporting some pushback from China on the Aukus deal, particularly where it comes to discussions surrounding Taiwan. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office has called remarks made by the US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell dangerous, after he suggested Aukus could help deter any Chinese move against Taiwan. “His remarks are very dangerous,” said spokesperson Zhu Fenglian when responding to a question at a weekly press conference. The establishment of the so-called trilateral security partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia is essentially to provoke military confrontation in the region through military cooperation in small circles. Campbell, who made a rare link between Taiwan and Aukus, told Washington’s Center for a New American Security thinktank that new submarine capabilities would enhance peace and stability, including in the strait that separates China and Taiwan. Zhu: Any attempt to use relevant military cooperation to intervene in the Taiwan issue is to interfere in China’s internal affairs, violate the one-China principle, and endanger peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We firmly oppose. Wong on two-state solution for Israel Palestine There’s been much discussion today about a speech Penny Wong gave last night, suggesting support for a Palestinian state may provide a pathway to a two-state solution.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,639,US defense secretary rejects Israel genocide accusations; Blinken and Cameron urge US House to pass Ukraine aid - as it happened,"The US has seen no evidence that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said. Austin, addressing a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing today, said: We don’t have any evidence of genocide being created. He also avoided referring to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October as a genocide, calling it a “horrific terrorist attack” and “certainly … a war crime”. Austin’s testimony was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding the war. A protester interrupted Defense Sec. Lloyd Austin during a Senate hearing on the Defense Dept.'s budget, calling for a cease-fire in Gaza as they were removed from the room by police. pic.twitter.com/JRdzFBTwL0 Arizona’s supreme court ruled to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect. The justices said Arizona could enforce a 1864 near-total abortion ban that went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade. Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said Tuesday was a “dark day” for the state and implored abortion rights supporters to make their voices heard in November. Joe Biden criticized the Arizona supreme court ruling, blaming “the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women’s freedom” and calling the ban “cruel”. Kamala Harris, in response to the ruling by the Arizona supreme court, said the state had “rolled back the clock to a time before women could vote”, and said Donald Trump was resopnsible for the ruling. Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday. Secretary of state Antony Blinken and his UK counterpart, foreign secretary David Cameron, urged Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine after talks in Washington during a joint press conference following talks in Washington on Tuesday. Blinken said the supplemental budget request that the president has made of Congress is “urgent” and should be taken to a vote “as quickly as possible”. Victory for Ukraine is “vital for American and European security”, Cameron said. Cameron also met with Trump over dinner on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. During the briefing with Blinken, Cameron defended the meeting as a standard encounter with an opposition figure and said it covered a number of pressing global issues but did not elaborate. “These things are entirely proper,” he said. Trump’s campaign said the former president and Cameron discussed the Ukraine war and “the need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements”. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the US has seen “no evidence” that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Austin addressed a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing and was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding Israel’s war in Gaza. A New York appeals court judge rejected the latest bid by Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Republican far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. Kamala Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday just days after the state’s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban. The vice president’s trip to Arizona, her second this year, was already in the works prior to Tuesday’s court decision and will likely take on a heightened focus on abortion rights and access, Politico reported. The White House said Harris will use her visit “to continue her leadership in the fight for reproductive freedoms”. Fifteen prominent historians filed an amicus brief with the supreme court, rejecting Donald Trump’s claim in his federal election subversion case that he is immune to criminal prosecution for acts committed as president. Authorities cited in the document include the founders Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Adams, in addition to the historians’ own work. Trump, the historians said, “asserts that a doctrine of permanent immunity from criminal liability for a president’s official acts, while not expressly provided by the constitution, must be inferred. To justify this radical assertion, he contends that the original meaning of the constitution demands it. But no plausible historical case supports his claim. Despite widespread legal and historical opinion that Trump’s immunity claim is groundless, the supreme court, to which Trump appointed three justices, will consider the claim. Oral arguments are scheduled for 25 April. The court recently dismissed attempts, supported by leading historians, to remove Trump from ballots under the 14th amendment, passed after the civil war to bar insurrectionists from office. As we reported earlier, defense secretary Lloyd Austin told the Senate earlier today that the US government has seen “no evidence” that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Austin addressed a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing and was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding Israel’s war in Gaza. The UK also confirmed in meetings with US counterparts that there would be no changes to arms exports to Israel, although it would be kept under review. Here’s the clip: Louisiana’s Republican-controlled senate advanced a bill on Monday that would empower state and local law enforcement to arrest and jail people in the state who entered the US illegally, similar to embattled legislation in Texas. Amid national fights between Republican states and Joe Biden over how and who should enforce the US-Mexico border, Louisiana joins a growing list of legislatures seeking to expand states’ authority over border enforcement. Proponents of the bill, such as the legislation’s author, GOP state senator Valarie Hodges, say Louisiana has the “right to defend our nation”. Hodges has accused the federal government of neglecting responsibilities to enforce immigration law, an argument heard from GOP leaders across the country. Opponents argue the bill is unconstitutional, will not do anything to make the state safer, and will only fuel negative and false rhetoric directed toward migrants. Across the nation, reliably red legislatures have advanced tougher immigration enforcement measures. The Oklahoma house passed a bill that would prohibit state revenue from being used to provide benefits to those living in the state illegally. A bill in Tennessee, which is awaiting the governor’s signature, would require law enforcement agencies in the state to communicate with federal immigration authorities if they discover people who are in the country illegally. Measures that mirror parts of the Texas law are awaiting the governor’s signature in Iowa, while another is pending in Idaho’s statehouse. Lawmakers and climate advocates called on utilities to “ditch the American Gas Association” at a press conference at the US Capitol on Tuesday. “Americans are already paying the price of climate change,” said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. They shouldn’t have to pay the salaries of those who are fueling it. A trade association representing more than 200 US utilities, the AGA has a well-documented history of lobbying against climate regulations and policies – activity funded in part by members’ ratepayers’ utility bills. It’s a “dirty game,” said Xavier Boatwright of the Sierra Club. Both the event and a protest outside the AGA’s headquarters earlier Tuesday were led by the anti-gas nonprofit organization the Gas Leaks Project. “There’s nothing natural about natural gas,” said the group’s senior communications director Maria Luisa Cesar. The extraction and use of gas, called natural gas by industry interests, emits planet-heating and toxic pollution. Reports show the AGA has been aware of these dangers for 50 years, but has continued to undercut climate efforts. Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse said: The fossil fuel industry depends in roughly equal parts on hydrocarbons and lies. In August, the New England utility Eversource cut ties with the American Gas Association. Advocates are calling on other utilities to follow its lead. Four states have also passed legislation to prevent the use of ratepayer dollars to fund political activity. Also in Arizona, Eva Burch, a Democratic state lawmaker who drew national attention after announcing her decision to seek an abortion earlier this month, said today’s court decision to enforce a ban - using a law that was originally drafted in the 19th Century before women could vote and before Arizona was a state - would have devastating consequences for women such as her. “A couple of weeks ago I had an abortion – a safe legal abortion here in Arizona for a pregnancy that I very much wanted,” Burch said. Somebody gave me a procedure so that I wouldn’t have to experience another miscarriage – the pain, the mess, the discomfort. And now we’re talking about whether or not we should put that doctor in jail. This is outrageous. Burch predicted the ruling would backfire on conservatives who have fought to allow the ban to be enforced. “The people of Arizona have had enough,” Burch said. We are electing pro-choice candidates in November. Watch it happen. Kamala Harris has responded to a ruling by the Arizona supreme court to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect, saying the state had “rolled back the clock to a time before women could vote”. In a statement, the vice president said there was “one person responsible” for the ruling, which will allow a law first passed in 1864 to go into effect, “by his own admission … Donald Trump”. Harris said the “extreme and dangerous” ban criminalizes almost all abortion care in the state and “puts women’s lives at risk”, adding: It’s a reality because of Donald Trump, who brags about being ‘proudly the person responsible’ for overturning Roe v. Wade, and made it possible for states to enforce cruel bans. She added: The alarm is sounding for every woman in America: if he has the opportunity, Donald Trump would sign off on a national abortion ban. He has called for punishing women and doctors. If he wins, he and his allies have plans to ban abortion and restrict access to birth control, with or without Congress. Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, called today’s news from the state’s supreme court on an abortion ban a “dark day” for the state and implored abortion rights supporters to make their voices heard in November. Hobbs vowed to do everything in her power to preserve access to reproductive care and contraception in the state, pointing to actions she has already taken. After winning the election in 2022, Hobbs last year issued a sweeping executive order banning county attorneys from prosecuting women who seek abortions and doctors who perform them. Asked about the possibility that her directive could be challenged in court, Hobbs said: “Bring it on.” At the news conference, held moments after the state supreme court released its decision, Hobbs called on the Republican-led state legislature to “immediately” repeal the ban. But the legislature is unlikely to do so. The leaders of both chambers joined anti-abortion activists in favor of allowing the territorial-era ban to take effect. “The legislature has ignored the will of the voters on this issue for decades,” she said. The ballot box is the way that voters can have their say and overrule the legislature on this issue that the vast majority of Arizonans support. It is a dark day in Arizona. We are just fourteen days away from one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country.But my message to Arizona women is this: I won't rest, and I won't stop fighting until we have secured the right to abortion.That is my promise to you. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just said that US government agencies were still involved in an “informal review” of the Israel Defense Forces’ review of the killing by the Israeli military of seven aid workers with the group World Central Kitchen in Gaza earlier this month. Sullivan said that the CIA director, Bill Burns, was involved in further talks in Cairo in Egypt at the weekend, where states such as the US and Qatar are trying to broker a ceasefire in Israel’s war in Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages held by Hamas since the massacre it perpetrated in southern Israel last 7 October. Sullivan said the US “has seen Israel take some steps forward” in the talks, while the latest statements from Hamas were regarded as “less than encouraging”. He said more humanitarian aid was reaching Gaza, which he said was “good, but not good enough”, amid Israel’s blockade and siege of the Palestinian territory. And amid Israel pulling troops out of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, in a pause in its offensive actions, Sullivan said the US has still not seen “a credible and executable” plan from Israel about what it would do to move or protect Palestinians in the event that, as it has pledged to do, it invades Rafah. Joe Biden has just arrived back at the White House after a very short trip to Washington’s main Union Station rail hub, to deliver remarks about healthcare. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was originally due to brief the media at 1.30pm in the regular daily session in the west wing, but obviously everything is being pushed back because the president’s schedule shifted later than originally expected, also. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will join the briefing. It’s getting underway now. We’ll bring you highlights from the briefing. There has been a lot of international-facing news today, especially with the latest on high-level talks in the Middle East about Israel’s war in Gaza and US secretary of state Antony Blinken and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron meeting in Washington, DC, and urging the US Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine. Joe Biden has criticized the Arizona supreme court ruling from earlier today to let an old law on the books banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect – albeit with a 14-day delay to allow further legal challenges before it does. The US president blamed “the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women’s freedom” and called the ban “cruel”. In a statement issued from the White House moments ago, Biden said: “Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest. This cruel ban was first enacted in 1864 – more than 150 years ago, before Arizona was even a state and well before women had secured the right to vote.” The statement ended with: “Vice-President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose. We will continue to fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade for women in every state.” Kamala Harris has taken a strong lead in recent months on efforts by the Biden administration and the Biden-Harris re-election campaign to win support for protecting reproductive rights. This follows, in particular, the landmark overturning of the federal right to abortion by the conservative-dominated supreme court in 2022 and further attacks on rights ranging from abortion pills to contraception to IVF by the hard right. The Arizona supreme court ruled on Tuesday to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect, a decision that could curtail abortion access in the US south-west and could make Arizona one of the biggest battlefields in the 2024 electoral fight over abortion rights. The justices said Arizona could enforce a 1864 near-total abortion ban, first passed before Arizona became a state, that went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade. However, the justices also ruled to hold off on requiring the state to enforce the ban for 14 days, in order to allow advocates to ask a lower court to pause it again. The ban can only be enforced “prospectively”, according to the 4-2 ruling. Minutes after the ruling Kris Mayes, Arizona’s Democratic attorney general, vowed not to prosecute any doctors or women under the 1864 ban. You can read the full story here. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, urged Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine after talks in Washington. Blinken and Cameron held a joint press conference where the US secretary of state said the stalled Ukraine funding is critical for US, European and world security. The supplemental budget request that Joe Biden has made of Congress is “urgent” and should be taken to a vote “as quickly as possible”, Blinken said. Victory for Ukraine is “vital for American and European security”, Cameron said. Cameron also met with Donald Trump over dinner on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. During the briefing with Blinken, Cameron defended the meeting as a standard encounter with an opposition figure and said it covered a number of pressing global issues but did not elaborate. “These things are entirely proper,” he said. Trump’s campaign said the former president and Cameron discussed the Ukraine war and “the need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements”. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, told a Senate armed services committee hearing that the US has seen no evidence that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. A New York appeals court judge rejected the latest bid by Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Republican far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. There’s a key US Senate race in Ohio this year, where the incumbent leftwing Democrat, Sherrod Brown, is expected to face a tough challenge from Bernie Moreno, a car dealer turned Trump-backed populist firebrand. Like many Trump-backed candidates, Moreno is making it his business to blame China for woes affecting blue-collar workers. Earlier this year, he went so far as to tell a conservative radio host: “The Buick Envision was made in China, I told General Motors I wouldn’t sell one of them, don’t even ship it to me.” The problem about the claim, which Moreno has made elsewhere, is that as Spectrum News reports … “Moreno’s dealership did sell the Chinese-made SUVs for several years, and even promoted the vehicles on social media, according to numerous social media posts.” After detailing such posts, Spectrum adds: “GM, the parent company of Buick, confirmed to Spectrum News the Envision was only manufactured in China. The SUV became the first Chinese-made vehicle to be imported by a major US automaker when it debuted in Michigan in 2016. The imports were called a “slap in the face” by the United Auto Workers union, which felt the vehicles should be made on US soil by American workers. A spokesperson for Moreno, Reagan McCarthy, told Spectrum: “In response to the closure of the Lordstown Plant here in Ohio [in March 2019], Bernie made a decision to stop any new inventory of Envision’s [sic] from being sold at his dealership. After he sold off the inventory he already had on the lot, he refused to take orders for more Envisions. There is zero contradiction here.” There are contradictions elsewhere in Moreno’s campaign statements, though, as the Guardian discussed here: A New York appeals court judge has rejected the latest bid by Donald Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Trump’s lawyers had requested the trial to be postponed indefinitely while he appeals a gag order that bars him from commenting about jurors, witnesses and others connected to the case. Trump’s attorneys argue that Justice Juan Merchan’s order restricting his public comments is an unconstitutional prior restraint on his free speech rights while he campaigns for president. Merchan imposed the order last month after finding Trump made statements in various legal cases that the judge called “threatening, inflammatory” and “denigrating”. During the hearing on Tuesday, Trump’s lawyer Emil Bove said: The First amendment harms arising from this gag order right now are irreparable. Justice Cynthia Kern issued the order following a Tuesday morning hearing, but a full panel of appeals judges will later consider the former president’s underlying challenge to the gag order. Austin, asked what the consequences of a deadly mass famine in Gaza would be, said: It will accelerate violence, and it will have the effect of ensuring that there’s a long-term conflict. Addressing the Senate armed services committee, the defense secretary added: It doesn’t have to happen ... We should continue to do everything we can, and we are doing this, to encourage the Israelis to provide humanitarian assistance.",2024-04-09

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,640,"To boost birthrates, we must give women the freedom of choice | Letters","Prof Devi Sridhar’s fine article gives a broad overview of a critical issue facing humanity that is far too often avoided: overpopulation (When desperate measures to persuade women to have children fail, it’s time for fresh thinking, 2 April). She gives sub-Saharan Africa as an example, but the issue applies globally. We are over 8 billion people on a planet that scientists estimate could sustainably support around 2 billion at a modest western living standard. Yes, fertility rates – the number of children a woman gives birth to – are falling, but too slowly. The world’s population is still rising by 80 million every year, each of whom will need food, water, accommodation and more, when these are already in short supply. Prof Sridhar calls for a more sympathetic view on immigration – a good call, but no solution to overpopulation. Instead, we should give more support to the excellent work being done by charities in sub-Saharan Africa. They are freeing girls from the cultural norm of having a large family by providing them with school places, often available only to boys. One survey found that providing girls with secondary school education dropped their fertility rate from the traditional six or seven to four, coupled with opportunities to find employment. Girls supported through tertiary education later had on average just two children. Richard VernonOxford  I have no disagreement with Devi Sridhar’s point about immigration. But when discussing falling birthrates, she only briefly mentions the obstacles to having children, focusing instead on women’s freedom of choice. She talks of women being able “to make choices based on the kind of happy life they want to live”, and that “it’s now acceptable and feasible … to decide against child-raising”. Even setting aside the fact that, historically, contraceptives were more widespread and family sizes smaller than we assume, these points about women’s choices are certainly true. But I am struck by how much my peers describe a lack of freedom. What Prof Sridhar fails to express are the ways in which those obstacles to child-raising, rarely addressed by government incentives, significantly impact women’s freedom of reproductive choice. I know many women who want another child, but find it all but impossible because of the impact on their careers, their finances, their bodies and their families. Having only one or two children might appear to be a victory of choice and access to contraceptives, but the reality is that those obstacles make it hard for women to have the children they desire. It is no coincidence that South Korea, which is failing to raise its birthrate, ranks at the bottom of the Economist’s list of working conditions for women. If people were truly able to “make choices based on the kind of happy life they want”, it would mean the freedom to decide not just against child-raising but also for child-raising. Robyn Boeré Oslo, Norway  I appreciate Devi Sridhar pointing out that declining fertility rates are a success story reflecting women gaining more choices over their bodies and lives. The trend towards smaller families is not a new one, and it has never been something to lament, but media outlets around the world sadly continue to portray it as a crisis. The panic over the economic impacts of smaller populations is absurd when you consider that the alternative – continuous population growth on a finite planet – can only lead to disaster. The UN projects that we are on track for 10 billion people by the 2050s, which will make it increasingly difficult to end environmental degradation and avert the worst outcomes of the climate crisis. Let’s be honest: a people shortage is the opposite of our problem. Prof Sridhar rightly points to immigration as a neglected policy solution that can help counter the effects of population ageing. Better preventive healthcare to keep older citizens fit and healthy for as long as possible is another one. So is investing in children’s health and education, improving their wellbeing and the odds that they’ll eventually become productive members of the workforce. We also need to recognise the many socioeconomic benefits of reduced population pressure, such as lower housing costs and less competition for jobs. Instead of fighting low birthrates, let’s plan for a more sustainable future by prioritising people over profits and ensuring that women everywhere are free to choose their family size.Olivia NaterPopulation Connection, Washington DC, US  Prof Devi Sridhar underlines what many women have known for years – this manufactured panic about falling birthrates is little more than misogyny, with a heap of racism thrown in for good measure. If a simple lack of working-age population were really the problem, immigration from countries with a growing fertility rate is an obvious salve. But for some reason, no one wants to acknowledge that. Victoria Williams London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,641,For 30 years I saw my kidnapping as character-building – until I finally faced what happened to me | Anna Broinowski,"In the scorching summer of 1987, young, invincible and hungry for adventure, I left my cloistered life at the University of Sydney to hitchhike to Darwin. I wanted to discover the “real” Australia, that classless utopia of rugged, self-made blokes in the Foster’s ads; the quixotic outback of explorers and mavericks celebrated by Xavier Herbert and Patrick White. Hitchhiking for art was a masculine pursuit, mythologised by Jack Kerouac and the beatniks. I wanted to update their 60s machismo with some brazenly female 80s cool. I would document my 8,000km trip, return to Sydney unscathed, and write a novel. Or so I thought. My companion, Andrew Peisley, and I hit the highway at Lithgow, armed with a tarp, seven books and a guitar. We’d survive on Peisley’s dole cheque and busk for counter-meals in pubs along the way. We agreed to remain platonic, accept every lift that got us closer to Darwin, and never split up. Four days in, at a Cunnamulla roadhouse, our rules imploded. I was kidnapped by truckies. Four of them, driving two road trains in convoy. They couldn’t fit us both in one truck so they offered to take me in the first and Peisley in the second. I climbed, just as Kerouac would, into the first rig and we drove off. But when Peisley approached the second truck, the driver slammed the door in his face. For five hours up a desolate stretch of the Simpson known as Death Highway, the truckies faked conversations on their two-way to convince me Peisley was in the second truck. They were drunk and high on ox blood, a trucker amphetamine. They made me drive the road train, force fed me pills, stripped and assaulted me. Gang-rape, perhaps something worse, was on the cards. Through stubbornness, arrogance and a miraculous stroke of luck, I survived. A random driver dropped Peisley at the Augathella turnoff, just when my abductors stopped for a rest. We escaped into the bush, made it to Darwin and had a magnificent adventure. I filed away my kidnapping as a useful character-building exercise and got on with life. If I had PTSD, I didn’t notice. I didn’t identify as a victim. I didn’t describe the ordeal in detail to others, or cry. When a friend asked if I’d been scared, I insisted, “No, I was furious!” As a gen X-er I discovered feminism in the 80s, when Thatcher and Reagan rejected collectivist civil rights in favour of profit-focused individualism. Women’s lib and bra burners were on the nose. For young, aspirational women like me, there was a palpable sense we had to compete with each other to climb up the pole. We navigated the daily hurdles of sexism alone, proud of our ability to not complain and get things done. For 30 years I thought I was unscarred, until Alyssa Milano’s groundbreaking 2017 tweet popped on to my feed: “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ … ” I normally rejected invitations to overshare as narcissistic but this time I felt compelled to reply: “1. the truckies who kidnapped me hitching to darwin 2. the film producer who asked to see my breasts in an audition 3. the man who stalked me in newtown and watched me shower 4. the men who whispered filthy things on the street even when I hid my body 5. the men who have started to look at my teenage daughter the same way – watch out.” Milano’s hashtag was retweeted 1m times with 12m Facebook reposts in less than two days – with many stories more horrific than mine. With two words, #MeToo created a digital sisterhood. It resurrected the mass activism of the second-wave feminists, reclaiming the collective voice the 80s backlash against “angry feminism” had erased and turbo-charging it across the globe. #MeToo’s 24 million contributors proved the misogyny we’d battled in private was endemic, part of a patriarchal power structure that divided us to remain intact. In 2019 I drove my daughter to Darwin to retrace my 80s hitchhiking trip, curious if the outback misogyny I’d encountered was still there. We found decency and antipathy in equal measure. At her co-ed primary, my daughter was surrounded by supportive boys, and she resisted my patriarchal critiques as too absolute. She forged her own connection with #MeToo in 2021, when a fellow high schooler, Chanel Contos, triggered a viral campaign against sexual abusers from Sydney’s all-male schools. #MeToo has weathered inevitable pushback since it began: for being too “politically white”; for not generating tangible change; for waging a “witch-hunt” against “gallant” men; for encouraging victims to speak out when punishment mechanisms are not in place; for making men feel confused, unsafe and fearful. But #MeToo has also unleashed an evolving, nuanced and crucial conversation, shifting the spotlight from abused to abuser. It has spread across the global south, giving agency and visibility to women in India, Bangladesh, China and South Korea. It has catalysed an overhaul of workplace practices and brought new credibility to the survivors of gendered-violence. It is providing parents of vulnerable boys, targeted by misogynists like Andrew Tate, an alternative path that shows feminism is good for men too. Male allies of #MeToo embody a new, more chivalrous masculinity that holds perpetrators of rape culture to account. In my own life, #MeToo brought me closer to my male friends, who responded to my Facebook post with concern. It gave me the confidence to document my kidnapping in a book, not as a victim, but as a survivor. It enabled me, emotionally, to finally process my assault, three decades on. And it has armed my daughter and her gen Z peers with the language they’ll need to reconfigure the nexus between feminism, gender and power in a fracturing world.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,643,"Date set for Israel’s invasion of Rafah, Netanyahu says | First Thing","Good morning. Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a date had been set for an Israeli invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. He did not disclose a specific date. In preparation for the invasion, Israel is buying 40,000 tents for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the city on the border of Egypt. Israeli officials maintain that Rafah is Hamas’s last major stronghold in Gaza. Many western countries, including the US, have voiced strong opposition to the proposed Israeli ground invasion as any attack on Rafah, where an estimated 1.5 million Palestinians – more than half of Gaza’s population – have taken refuge after fleeing Israeli bombardments elsewhere in the territory. What’s the situation in the rest of Gaza? The world’s global authority on food security is predicting that a famine is either already happening or will begin before July. “Everyone here has lost more than a quarter of their body weight due to malnutrition. There is no food,” said Mohammed Salha, acting director of al-Awda hospital. What about in Khan Younis? After Israel withdrew its troops from Khan Younis, thousands of Palestinians returned to the devastated city, where about 55% of buildings have been destroyed or damaged. Ahmad Abu al-Rish said: “It’s all just rubble. Animals can’t live here, so how is a human supposed to?” David Cameron, the British foreign security, has met with Donald Trump in Florida amid a push to shore up support for Ukraine and advance a new package of aid that is held up in Congress. “It is standard practice for ministers to meet with opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said. Cameron and Trump purportedly discussed Ukraine, the war in Gaza and the future of Nato during their meeting. The meeting took place before Cameron’s visit to Washington, where he is expected to push to be given the resources needed to “go on the offensive” in 2025 and will urge congressional leaders to “change the narrative” on support for Kyiv, the Foreign Office said. Joe Biden announced plans to cancel student loans for 30 million borrowers, in the administration’s latest push on addressing student debt before the presidential election. More than 100 Indigenous people in Brazil’s Javari valley – 80% of the Korobu tribe – have fallen ill, raising fears that the situation could escalate into an epidemic. The special counsel pursuing federal criminal charges against Trump for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss have filed a brief urging the supreme court to reject the former president’s bid for immunity from prosecution. Fulton county prosecutors have asked the Georgia state court of appeals to reject Trump’s request to consider his claim that the district attorney should be disqualified over a relationship with her deputy. March marked the 10th consecutive month in which yet another global heat record was shattered. Over the past 12 months, average global temperatures have been 1.58C above pre-industrial levels, exceeding the 1.5C benchmark set as a target in the Paris climate agreement. The planet has been warming at a pace of 0.3C a decade over the past 15 years, almost double the 0.18C a decade trend since the 1970s. “Is this within the range of climate variability or signal of accelerated warming? My concern is it might be too late if we just wait to see,” said Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, one of the vice-chairs of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Green onions, a simple staple of Korean cooking, have become a powerful symbol of voter anger in the weeks leading up to South Korea’s national assembly elections. After a botched visit to a supermarket by Yoon Suk Yeol, the country’s conservative president, in an effort to seem relatable amid a cost of living crisis, the National Election Commission has banned green onions outside polling stations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”. In Ethiopia, where coffee comprises about a third of its export earnings, new European legislation could have significant impact on the industry. The EU regulation on deforestation-free products (EUDR) – due to come into force in 2025 – bans the sale of coffee, rubber, cocoa and other products if companies cannot prove that it did not come from deforested land. Ethiopia’s coffee industry is claiming that the new rules are unfair since almost all Ethiopia’s coffee is grown by poor farmers who own small plots of land and lack the expertise to gather the complex data needed to show compliance. “Meeting the criteria requires a lot of technology and manpower that we simply don’t have,” said Abebe Megnecto, the manager of Kafa’s coffee union, which represents 13,676 local farmers. Despite their commitments on the climate, the world’s biggest economies have continued to finance the expansion of fossil fuels in poor countries. The G20 group of developed and developing economies, and the multilateral development banks they fund, put $142bn into fossil fuel developments overseas from 2020 to 2022. “While rich countries continue to drag their feet and claim they can’t afford to fund a globally just energy transition, countries like Canada, Korea, Japan and the US appear to have no shortage of public funds for climate-wrecking fossil fuels,” said Claire O’Manique, a public finance analyst at campaigning group Oil Change International. A West Virginia woman has set a world record by marrying a man who is nearly three feet shorter than her. Jessica Burns-McDonnell is 5ft 10in (1.8 metres) while her husband, Larry – who was born with diastrophic dwarfism – is 3ft (91.4cm). “I mean, you might find a person who looks exactly like what you want but you need someone who makes you feel and think and love,” Burns-McDonnell said. “That’s what I got with Larry, and I don’t think there’s anybody out there that’s taller than Larry that could come close.” First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,644,David Cameron meets Donald Trump amid push to shore up Ukraine support,"The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has taken the unusual and potentially risky step of travelling to see Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida before a visit to Washington DC on Tuesday. Cameron was hoping to persuade the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to drop his opposition to a new package of aid for Ukraine that is being held up in Congress partly on Trump’s instruction. It is Cameron’s second visit to the US to try to convince Republicans that it is in America’s national interest for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, not to make any further military advances in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Sunday that Ukraine would lose the war if US aid was withheld and Ukrainian air cover not improved. The risk is that past bad blood between Cameron and Trump over issues such as Brexit have poisoned the well, and Cameron, for all his persuasive skills, is not the British political leader most likely to make Trump change his mind. Cameron is scheduled to hold talks with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington on Tuesday. Although they have much to discuss covering the future of Nato, China and a possible ceasefire in Gaza, the foreign secretary’s key goal is to shift Republican thinking in Congress on the relevance of the threat posed by Russia to American interests. A steady stream of European politicians have travelled to Washington on similar missions, only to return frustrated at the growing US indifference to Ukraine’s fate. The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has so far declined to allow the Ukraine aid issue onto the floor of the Congress, but has indicated he might do so next week when Congress returns from recess. In February, the speaker refused to consider a Senate-passed foreign aid package that would have included $60bn for Ukraine because it lacked measures relating to security on the US-Mexico border. In a statement on Monday, a Foreign Office spokesperson played down the rarity of a Conservative foreign secretary trying to persuade a Republican not to make concessions to Russia over the future of Europe. The Foreign Office said it was “standard practice for ministers to meet opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement”. Although Conservative politicians have met Trump, as has his great ally Nigel Farage, Monday’s meeting was the first between a senior UK minister and Trump since he left office insisting that the presidential election had been stolen from him. Trump has said he can negotiate a peace deal on Ukraine in 24 hours. His allies say the deal will involve ceding Crimea and the Donbas region to Russia, formalising the land grab that Putin started in 2014 and continued with the full-scale invasion in 2022. “Success for Ukraine and failure for [Vladimir] Putin are vital for American and European security,” Cameron said before his trip. “This will show that borders matter, that aggression doesn’t pay and that countries like Ukraine are free to choose their own future. The alternative would only encourage Putin in further attempts to redraw European borders by force, and would be heard clearly in Beijing, Tehran and North Korea.” Earlier this year, he warned Congress not to show “the weakness displayed against Hitler” in the 1930s. Cameron is also arguing that Ukraine has shown time and again that if it is given the resources it can succeed and would be ready to “go on the offensive” in 2025. Aware that Trump believes Europe does not pull its weight in defending itself, Cameron is armed with statistics to show more than $184bn (£145bn) has already been committed to Ukraine by European nations including more than $15bn (nearly £12bn) from the UK. Cameron will say in DC that nothing can match the pace and scale of US support, which remains “the keystone in the arch” in the fight for democracy, the Foreign Office said. The US sent its final tranche of munitions and equipment in December, using the last of its funding from a previous supplemental to assist Ukrainian forces. On a previous trip to the US, the rightwing congresswoman and staunch Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene told Cameron to “kiss my ass” and “worry about his own country”. A key test for Cameron’s trip is whether he gains meetings with the swing Republican congressmen including Johnson. At present no meeting with Johnson is slated for Tuesday. Talks will also focus on the Middle East, with the foreign secretary expected to set out the UK’s reasoning for not suspending arms sales to Israel. Ministers face Labour pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. Downing Street said it had no plans to publish the advice but that it wanted to be transparent about its decision to continue exporting arms during the Gaza conflict. Cameron will also be pressed on whether the UK supports an Israeli offensive in Rafah, the southern hold-out town in Gaza, if the current round of talks between Hamas and Israel being staged in Cairo fail.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,645,"Michael Palin on the loss of his wife of 57 years: ‘I’d love Helen to still be here, telling me off’","The strange thing about Michael Palin is you feel you know him; that he’s an old friend or much-loved uncle you’ve not seen for a while. He decides to come to Guardian HQ for our interview, and nobody seems surprised to see him, despite the fact that it’s his first time in the building. People smile at Palin with easy familiarity: ah, Michael’s popped in. He smiles back with that fabulously genial smile: a little bit cheeky, a little bit shy, and very warm. We have never met before. But he’s been in my life for 50-odd years. First as part of Monty Python, the surrealist comedy troupe I quoted ad nauseam as a youngster (“Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition!”), then as star of the wonderful TV series Ripping Yarns, which I also quoted ad nauseam (“Oh shut up, you boring little tit!”). There were also the films: Time Bandits, A Private Function, A Fish Called Wanda and, more recently, The Death of Stalin. For the past 35 years, he has travelled the globe for TV shows, and written books to accompany his odysseys. In 2019, he was knighted for services to travel, culture and geography – the only Python to receive a knighthood. Now he has got a new three-part TV series about Nigeria, where he meets young people hoping to make their fortune: a young woman trying to rebuild her life after being kidnapped by Boko Haram; an environmentalist fighting government corruption; and a woman who berates him for the sins of British colonialism in Benin. It is fascinating to observe the dynamics between the diffident, eternally apologetic Palin and the more direct Nigerians. He is visibly shocked when the woman shouts him down in the street and makes him take the rap for Britain’s brutal Benin Expedition of 1897. The series is important for him as an exploration of Nigeria, as well as a means of confronting Britain’s past. But it is also important in a more personal way. This is the first major project he has taken on since his wife Helen died 10 months ago. They had been married for 57 years, having first met in 1959, on a family trip to Southwold in Suffolk, when he was 15 and she was 16. Their holiday romance was fictionalised in his 1987 BBC drama East of Ipswich. Although Helen rarely accompanied him on his travels, he worried he wouldn’t be able to do the Nigeria trip without her. “I was quite concerned about whether I could physically and mentally deal with it just a few months after Helen had died. But I enjoyed the experience tremendously. I felt I can do this, I can get out there. It’s not someone giving me a job because my wife’s just died. Actually, it regenerated me in a way.” Helen, a teacher and then a bereavement counsellor, was 80 when she died of kidney failure, after stopping her dialysis treatment because she was in so much pain. It was Helen, he says, who encouraged him to do the travel documentaries in the first place. Palin was 45 when he was offered Around the World in 80 Days, a seven-part BBC series inspired by the Jules Verne novel. “Helen was quite clear that if I didn’t do this I’d be sort of moodily staring across the kitchen table at someone else doing it. She knew I’d be happier if I did the travels and avoided staying at home.” His expeditions included the 23,000-mile trip from the north to south pole, North Korea, and Ethiopia mid-coup. Did Helen worry for him? He laughs. If she did, she didn’t show it. “She was quite calm about wherever I was.” Palin is a master of understatement, opinions usually qualified by “quite”. He could be away for five months at a time. Sometimes he would find it hard, he says, but he’s convinced his travels helped their marriage. How? “Well, they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it’s true. Our relationship was very loving, but it was very practical. Very pragmatic.” Although they valued their independence, they shared so much: values, confidences, sense of humour, friends. During Helen’s final two years she suffered huge discomfort. “She told me how ill she felt, how unhappy she felt at not being able to live the life she wanted. Most of my time was spent just trying to assuage her pain. She was amazing how she dealt with it.” Helen died at the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead, north London, last May. Palin says the final couple of weeks, with their three children there, too, could not have been happier. “Just before she died, when she knew she was going to die, were actually some of the best times we’ve had. I was prepared for it. Helen had taken the decision that she wasn’t going to carry on having dialysis. She was amazingly well looked after, and all the family were there. And that was the payoff for all those years, those 60 years.” He talks so tenderly about Helen and the end of her life. Then he comes to an abrupt stop, as if clicked out of hypnosis. “Sorry, I’m waffling,” he says. No you’re not, I say. I ask what he means by the payoff. “Well, because we’d spent so long together, we knew each other pretty well.” He pauses. Even he knows this is an understatement too far. “Very, very well. It didn’t all have to be stated why we’d like this or that. We didn’t have to say a lot. It was just there. So knowing that she had two weeks to live, somehow everything that had been part of our relationship made it much easier to deal with her departure.” There were no scores to settle, confessions to make, or misunderstandings to iron out. They knew everything about each other. So there wasn’t even much need for talking. “The most important thing to me in her last days was making sure she had access to the family and friends I knew she loved and would not see again. I was just sort of shepherding her through and making sure she was able to talk to the people she wanted to talk to; or, if she just wanted peace and quiet, she’d have peace and quiet.” Does it still seem very recent? “Yes. I mean, I’m quite surprised. I’ve been working quite hard since she died, and that’s been a distraction. But every now and then, the house seems empty and you feel you’ll never have a friend as close as that; you’ll never have someone who knows as much about you as Helen did about me. There are things I can’t talk about in the same way to anybody else. I’ve got lots of good friends, and we can chat about things, but, you know, the rapport between the two of us over all these years was quite singular. And I miss that. I sometimes think: she lived to be 80, I’m 80 now, so what’s next? What do you do with the rest of the time? Partly, I think, well, at 80 you’re on your way to the departure lounge.” He doesn’t say this in a maudlin way. It feels more as if he’s thinking aloud. You are an incredibly youthful 80, I say. Would you like to find somebody you could share things with in the same way? “Oh, I just can’t imagine anybody else taking Helen’s place.” Anyway, he says, in some sense she’s still with him. “I always listen to Helen. I mean, I’m kind of in touch with her on a daily basis because I know what she would think about all the various things that I do.” Do you talk to her? “Well, yeah, I do occasionally.” When? “Well, I just do it coming into an empty room after you’ve had a long session or something, doing a long interview for the Guardian, whatever, something that really kind of wears you out! You get in and you’re going through the door, and I always speak and say: ‘Whoa, wow, that was something!’ It’s just as a little moment, which helps me when I get into the house, rather than just going in and it’s all key in the lock and silence.” Look, he says, he’s not complaining. He knows he’s been lucky to experience such love. Come to think of it, he says, he’s been lucky in life. Palin grew up in Sheffield. Like his father (an engineer who worked for a steel company) and his grandfather, he went to the private school Shrewsbury and was Oxbridge educated. His father, Edward, had a good sense of humour, but his jokes were impeded by a terrible stammer. “He was quite an angry man, and he had quite a short fuse. It was difficult in the house to talk about things, generally. And he was picking arguments all the time with my mother. I think he rather took it out on people around him. He was very confrontational, which has made me unconfrontational. I try anything to avoid confrontation.” Typically of Palin, rather than rejecting his father, he sought to understand his frustration and gave his name to the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering. He never dared to dream of making a career out of comedy, acting, travelling or writing. (The project he says he’s proudest of is his 2018 book, Erebus: The Story of a Ship, about the eponymous vessel that ventured farther south than any human had ever been on its first voyage, and vanished with its 129-strong crew in the wastes of the Canadian Arctic on its second.) Palin assumed he was destined for a regular, respectable job. But, he says, he has always been in the right place at the right time. At Oxford, he met the cultural historian Robert Hewison, who suggested his humour was a gift and potentially a lucrative one. He was introduced to future fellow Pythons, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman, who had all studied at Cambridge, and they decided to work as a team. Perhaps luckiest of all was the day they visited the BBC in 1969 on the off-chance of getting some work. “It was remarkable. We were chaperoned by Barry Took who was very keen on the work we’d done individually. He said: ‘Well, I’ve got a suit on and I can take you to the BBC and find you someone we can talk to. We were ushered into a small room and Michael Mills, who was head of comedy, came in after quite a good lunch I think, because he was in quite a good mood, and he asked us various questions about what we wanted to do. None of which we were able to adequately respond to. It was the world’s worst job interview. Was there going to be music? We don’t know. Were there going to be guest artists? Well, we don’t know. Were there going to be women in the show? We don’t know. At the end, Mills stood up and looked down the table at us and said: ‘I’ll give you 13 shows but that’s all.’ It was the best sentence anybody’s ever said to me in my life.” Does he think that could happen at the BBC today? “No. The BBC was much more buccaneering back then. There were individuals who could make decisions on their own if they wanted to take a chance with something others didn’t like. And, to be honest, most people in the BBC hierarchy didn’t like Monty Python to start with at all. But you could do it and it would be respected. Now there would be far more investigations into what you wanted to do, people checking content and that you’re not being rude about people. I don’t think it would have gone anywhere today. It would have been censored at source.” Palin shares some of the concerns Cleese has expressed about topics increasingly being considered off limits in comedy. “At the moment it’s getting a bit ridiculous, when there are strictures over what you can say. I don’t think the outside world should impose on comedy. Comedy should subvert. Comedy’s got to make you feel freer.” Why does he think Python proved so influential? “People found it quite bracing. You were able to make jokes about the prime minister and the army and the church, which you’d never been able to do before. It’s very important that people can escape, in comedy, from the conformity they’re forced into.” He says it is dangerous to be rose-tinted about the past, but he does worry that the country has become more intolerant and less caring. “Political discourse has become very unpleasant. The country is run on the basis of getting as much money out of people as we can everywhere. It’s all about marketing and selling.” Does he think he has changed over the years? “Not really. I’m a cautious and slightly shy person and always have been. But I’ve been given a chance to do things I never expected. All that is quite surprising to me.” There have been profoundly bleak moments in his life. He lost too many friends early, including former Pythons Terry Jones (his main collaborator) and Chapman, as well as ex-Beatle George Harrison. His sister Angela killed herself when she was 52, something he has never come to terms with. “She was absolutely terrific. But she had this long-term depression. I could never quite understand where it came from, how deep it was, but it was there. That was a loss I’ve never really quite understood. I can’t understand why somebody, who had such talent and ability and was so liked, should have … why there should have been such a dark space there …” He trails off. Fortunately, he says, his disposition is sunny, and the stability in his life has kept him grounded. Again, he returns to Helen. “My horizons are fairly local. Helen and I were together for 60 years, we lived in the same part of London a long time; I have never wanted to change the basics of my life: the relationships, the friends, the house. It’s been essential for them to be there so I could not get totally deluded by fame and success.” Palin is all talked out. He tells me, apologetically, that he is exhausted, and again mentions his age. “I’m 80-plus now,” he says. What’s with the plus? “OK, 80 and 11 months!” He grins. “It’s time to go walking off the end of a pier.” I tell him I don’t think he’s ready for the departure lounge, or the end of the pier. He nods, and says I’ve got a point. In 2019, he had open-heart surgery: one valve replaced, one repaired. “Now that’s sorted, and I’m more cautious about what I eat and drink, I feel fitter than I have done in ages.” All things considered, he says, he’s pretty content. “You’ve got to keep doing things. I’d love Helen to still be with me, telling me off, but yes, I’m very happy where I am.” Michael Palin in Nigeria starts on 16 April at 9pm on Channel 5.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,646,The world court will rule on Germany’s support for Israel. That shows how geopolitics has changed | Steve Crawshaw,"The case brought by Nicaragua against Germany at the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague this week is a powerful example of the unprecedented political impact that the Gaza conflict is having around the world. Most obviously, Israel’s continuing assault after the 1,200 brutal murders and about 240 kidnappings by Hamas on 7 October has had a deadly impact on Palestinians. More than 30,000 people in Gaza have been killed, and a famine is now looming. The conflict has also opened up a division between the global north and south in a way not seen before. Nicaragua’s case focuses on Germany’s supply of arms to Israel – the country supplied more than €326m (£258m) last year, which equated to more than a quarter of Israel’s military imports. It also calls on Germany to restore Gaza funding to Unrwa, the UN agency that provides Palestinians with humanitarian aid. Nicaragua says the arms sales mean Germany is “facilitating” genocide. On Monday, it accused Germany of doing “business as usual – or better than usual” because of its burgeoning weapons sales. Germany, which is due to respond today, says Israel has breached “neither the genocide convention nor international humanitarian law” and that it remains “calm”. In some respects, its calmness is justified: Nicaragua’s accusation of complicity in genocide sets a high burden of proof. But Germany is under pressure, too. After 7 October, chancellor Olaf Scholz said that “there is only one place for Germany: at Israel’s side”. It was, he said, “a perpetual task for us to stand up for the security of the state of Israel”. The good intentions that underlie that philosophy – Israel as Germany’s “raison d’état”, in the words of Scholz’s predecessor Angela Merkel – are clear. But Germany’s unquestioning support for Israel is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. Germany sees itself as a global voice for human rights, yet it has continued to sell arms to Israel, and has silenced the voices of Jewish people and members of the public who have condemned the Israeli assault. Nicaragua’s court challenge puts this into sharp perspective. South Africa’s case at the ICJ in January challenged one taboo by accusing Israel itself of inciting or committing genocide – a word created by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer, in 1944 in direct response to the Holocaust. This week, Nicaragua is challenging another taboo by suggesting that Germany, whose very identity is built around taking responsibility for that earlier genocide, is now paving the way for that same crime. As Der Spiegel puts it: “Germany’s international reputation, after all, is partially based on the fact that it has drawn credible lessons from its criminal past … But since 7 October, accusations have been swirling that Berlin is applying a double standard.” German opinion polls have swung dramatically in ways that no politician can ignore. Critics of the Gaza assault have more than doubled to 69%; support for Israel’s conduct of the war has collapsed to just 18%. Almost nine in 10 Germans now think there should be more pressure on Israel. Germany’s Green foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, sounded impatient when she said that aid must immediately get into Gaza with “no more excuses”. The Social Democrat Scholz has begun to sound critical, too, asking on a visit to Israel last month: “No matter how important the goal, can it justify such terribly high costs? Or are there other ways to achieve your goal?” German lawyers have brought a case calling for Germany to end its arms sales to Israel. Britain and other governments are facing the same pressures, while a Dutch court found a “clear risk” that exported F-35 jet parts could be used in breaches of international humanitarian law. Nicaragua is hardly a poster child when it comes to respect for human rights. Its 78-year-old president, Daniel Ortega, seen as a liberal darling when rebels defeated a dictatorship 45 years ago, presides over what a recent UN report described as “serious systematic human rights violations, tantamount to crimes against humanity”, including “a spiral of violence marked by the persecution of all forms of political opposition”. Nicaragua was one of just four governments – along with Syria, North Korea and Belarus – that backed Russia’s illegal annexation of eastern Ukraine in 2022. But Nicaragua’s hypocrisy on human rights doesn’t take away from the double standards that Germany and others have displayed. The UN security council remains a lost cause for enforcing human rights because of America’s continuing veto mindset (a matching pair to Moscow’s veto on Syria). The ICJ is therefore becoming a place where pressure can be exerted. Some of that pressure is on Israel itself. But especially susceptible are those governments that are caught between a rock and a judicially hard place – reluctant to argue with Israel, but equally eager not to pick fights with the world court, whose other current cases include Ukraine and potential genocide in Myanmar. This week’s Nicaragua case is one of three Israel cases all running in parallel in The Hague (four, if you count the international criminal court, which recently appointed a former British military prosecutor to lead its Gaza investigations). In February, the ICJ held hearings on the request from the UN general assembly to examine the legal consequences arising from Israeli policies in the occupied territories. Last month, the court followed up on its January finding of a “plausible” risk of genocide, in response to the case brought by South Africa. (South Africa, too, is selective about whose human rights it cares about; Pretoria has rolled out the red carpet for a Sudanese warlord accused of grave war crimes.) In their most recent rulings, judges unanimously demanded the “unhindered provision at scale” of humanitarian aid in Gaza, and also demanded, by a majority of fifteen to one, that Israel ensure “with immediate effect” that its military does not commit acts of genocide. Cumulatively, these court cases, thousands of miles from New York, are a reminder that the rules of geopolitics have changed. Once upon a time, western governments could always be confident of protecting their friends, no matter what crimes they were alleged to have committed. As this week’s hearings remind us, those days are gone.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,647,Australia says military collaboration with Japan is not about creating ‘Jaukus’,"Aukus partners are set to collaborate with Japan on military technology but they are not creating “Jaukus”, Australian leaders say. In a joint statement released on Tuesday, the Aukus triumvirate of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States confirmed it was considering teaming up with Japan for the second stage of the Aukus strategy. The Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, the UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, and the US defence secretary, Lloyd J Austin, said they were seeking advanced military capability “in support of regional stability and security”. The idea has drawn the ire of China, which said it was “gravely concerned” about a plan that was “stoking bloc confrontation”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia insists its plan to buy up to three Virginia-class submarines from the US while the local industry gets up to speed does not mean it is obliged to help the US in any military efforts in the region. However, the US deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, last week suggested they could be deployed against China in any military conflict over Taiwan. China has always been a vocal critic of Aukus and its implied mission to push back against Chinese power. While Aukus talk often focuses on Australia’s planned procurement of nuclear-powered submarines, the boats are “pillar 1”. Pillar 2 will include underwater drones, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, electronic warfare and hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Tuesday that Japan was a “natural candidate” for collaboration. “We’ve already stepped up our defence relationship with Japan in agreements I’ve signed with prime minister [Fumio] Kishida, including access by Japan for Australian bases,” he said. “We have had recently joint naval operations with Japan, including here in Australia, but, when we look at pillar 2, that project-by-project approach is there. What is not proposed is to expand the membership of Aukus.” Marles said Japan had a “very advanced technological industrial base” and did “a lot of incredible work in defence industry as well” but would not be part of the three-nation team. The Australian defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said any projects would be “about technological collaboration where it makes sense for all parties involved”. “It’s not about Japan joining Aukus. It’s not about Japan being part of the Five Eyes intelligence community,” he told ABC’s Radio National. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said the US, UK and Australia were “sending signals of Aukus expansion” and “escalating [an] arms race in the Asia-Pacific to the detriment of peace and stability in the region”. “China is gravely concerned about it,” Ning said. “We oppose relevant countries cobbling together exclusive groupings and stoking bloc confrontation. “Japan needs to earnestly draw lessons from history and stay prudent on military and security issues.” Japan became a pacifist nation after the second world war, when the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and enforced a constitution that the nation never maintain military forces. About a decade later, it created the Self-Defense Forces. More recently, in reaction to China’s belligerence and North Korea’s aggressive tactics, it has been increasing its defence spending and capability. The Aukus defence ministers said the “acquisition of a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability is a necessary response to the rapidly evolving strategic environment”. “Strengthening our trilateral defence capabilities and our industrial capacity will enable Aukus partners to deter coercion or aggression in the region more effectively,” the statement said. It went on to say that the Aukus nations had been clear they planned to “engage others” in pillar 2 projects, and were “considering cooperation with Japan”. “Our objective remains to further the delivery of advanced military capabilities to our respective defence forces in support of regional stability and security; we are confident that engaging like-minded partners in the work of pillar 2 will only strengthen this pursuit,” the statement said. “Recognising Japan’s strengths and its close bilateral defence partnerships with all three countries, we are considering cooperation with Japan on Aukus Pillar II advanced capability projects.” The US president, Joe Biden, is set to meet with Kishida this week, and the pair will reportedly discuss the collaboration. Since Aukus was announced in 2021, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea have also been mentioned as potential partners.",2024-04-09 06:27:08,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/australia-says-military-collaboration-with-japan-is-not-about-creating-jaukus,The Guardian,647,set collaborate japan military technology say joint statement triumvirate united kingdom united confirmed considering teaming japan second stage strategy defence minister defence secretary grant u defence secretary j said seeking advanced military capability support regional stability security idea drawn ire china said gravely concerned plan bloc confrontation sign guardian free morning afternoon daily news roundup plan buy three u local industry speed mean obliged help u military region however u deputy secretary state last week could china military conflict china always vocal critic mission push back power talk often procurement pillar 1 pillar 2 include underwater quantum artificial intelligence electronic warfare hypersonic prime minister said japan natural candidate collaboration weve already stepped defence relationship japan prime minister access japan base said recently joint naval japan look pillar 2 approach expand membership said japan advanced technological industrial base lot incredible work defence industry well would part team defence industry minister pat said would technological collaboration sense involved japan joining japan part five intelligence community told radio national foreign ministry mao said u sending expansion arm race detriment peace stability region china gravely concerned said oppose relevant cobbling together exclusive bloc confrontation japan need earnestly draw history stay prudent military security japan pacifist nation second world war u atomic enforced constitution nation never maintain military decade later recently reaction belligerence north aggressive tactic increasing defence spending capability defence said acquisition conventionally armed submarine capability necessary response rapidly strategic environment strengthening trilateral defence industrial capacity enable deter coercion aggression region effectively statement said went say clear engage pillar 2 considering japan objective remains delivery advanced military respective defence support regional stability security confident engaging work pillar 2 strengthen pursuit statement said close bilateral defence three considering japan pillar advanced capability u president joe set meet week pair reportedly discus collaboration since 2021 new canada south korea also potential military collaboration japan
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,648,Tuesday briefing: What to expect from the next phase of the Post Office inquiry,"Good morning. It is, in the words of the prime minister, “one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history”. The Post Office Horizon scandal led to 236 innocent subpostmasters being sent to prison, and more than 4,000 others suffering – whether it be losing jobs, bankruptcy, family breakdowns or homelessness. At least four of those accused have since killed themselves. Starting today – 25 years after the first post office operators were convicted for theft, fraud and false accounting that we now know was caused not by them but by the Post Office’s faulty IT system – the former subpostmasters’ stories will be heard at the public inquiry into the scandal. At 10am today Alan Bates – the real life hero of the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, in which he is played by Toby Jones – will take the stand at Aldwych House, in central London, and tell the inquiry his story. Then, in the coming weeks and month’s the Post Office’s bosses, including former chief executive Paula Vennells, will be called to give evidence under oath about what they really knew about the faulty Horizon IT system – and, crucially, when. For today’s newsletter, my colleague Jane Croft, who has been covering the scandal since 2018, provides a primer of what to expect. That’s after the headlines, but spoiler alert: expect the sudden onset of “amnesia” to continue, with many ex-bosses saying: “I do not recall.” Israel-Gaza | David Cameron will set out the UK’s reasoning for continuing to export arms to Israel on Tuesday as ministers face ongoing pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. On Monday evening, the foreign secretary held talks with Donald Trump in Florida amid a push to shore up support for Ukraine. Carers | Ministers are facing calls to abandon the “cruel and nonsensical” fines levied on tens of thousands of unpaid carers for unwittingly breaching earnings rules by just a few pounds a week. The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), a centre-right thinktank, said the government should accept that it was to blame for allowing overpayments to run up to huge sums. Fossil fuels | The world’s biggest economies have continued to finance the expansion of fossil fuels in poor countries to the tune of billions of dollars, despite their commitments on the climate. Canada, Japan and South Korea were the biggest sources of such finance in the three years studied, according to campaigning groups Oil Change International (OCI) and Friends of the Earth US. Home Office | Families in Gaza have won a legal case against the Home Office after a judge found it had reached “irrational and unreasonable” conclusions to justify its refusal to consider the families’ reunion applications. Two challenges were brought against the government department after it refused to decide on reunion applications from families in Gaza without biometric data. Politics | Downing Street has urged MPs to be cautious when responding to unsolicited messages, after the “spear-phishing” attack that targeted more than a dozen MPs, staff and journalists working in Westminster. On Tuesday evening it was reported that William Wragg, the Conservative MP who divulged colleagues’ personal phone numbers as part of the scandal, had stepped down from two Commons roles. It’s a scandal that has been ruining lives across the country for decades, but it only really hit the wider public consciousness when the ITV drama came out over the Christmas holidays. “Suddenly, the Post Office scandal was leading the news bulletins,” Jane says. “And politicians were falling over themselves to talk about how awful it was.” Less than a week after the final episode of the drama, Rishi Sunak announced legislation for a new law to “swiftly exonerate and compensate” all the victims. “People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and their reputations destroyed through absolutely no fault of their own. The victims must get justice and compensation,” he said on 10 January. The inquiry, chaired by retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, has been trying to get to the truth since it launched on 29 September 2020. It is phases five and six, covering “redress”, “oversight” and “whistleblowing”, that begin today. What has the inquiry heard so far? “The impact this scandal has had on thousands of people’s lives has been truly devastating,” Jane says. “These are ordinary people, without money and connections that have been caught up in this real David and Goliath battle.” In personal impact statements to the inquiry, the victims have spoken about losing everything. “It’s not just their money,” Jane says. “It’s their liberty, their partners, their families, their homes. Some spoke about their children being bullied at school, being shunned by their local community, and being referred to as ‘the postmaster who stole old people’s pensions’.” Jo Hamilton, who ran a post office in a village shop in South Warnborough, Hampshire and was played by Monica Dolan in the TV series, pleaded guilty to false accounting. She had to pay back a supposedly missing £36,000, though the grandmother-of-three did avoid jail. But the trauma continued. One day, while making Easter bonnets at her granddaughter’s school, the headteacher told her she would have to leave the premises as she could not be alone with the children because of her conviction. “Jo, and the other subpostmasters, have had or will get compensation,” Jane says. “But their lives have been absolutely ruined. You can’t compensate for lost time, you can’t buy back time.” What do the post office operators want the inquiry to find out now? “They want justice and for the truth to come out,” Jane says. “It feels like the Post Office knew the Horizon IT system wasn’t working properly, but they continued to prosecute these innocent people anyway.” The subpostmasters want to know what Post Office bosses, executives from Fujitsu (the Japanese company that developed the IT software), and government ministers knew about the faulty Horizon system. The judge in a high court case in 2019 concluded that “bugs, errors and defects” meant there was a “material risk” Horizon was to blame for the money missing from post office operators’ accounts.Paula Vennells – who was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019, for which she earned about £5m – is likely to be asked why she decided to spend millions prosecuting the post office operators when the company was aware of the Horizon problems. Who knew what about Horizon – and when? Whether the Horizon system could be used to remotely access post office operators’ accounts is key to the scandal, and alleged cover-up. In 2015 the Post Office told a House of Commons inquiry: “There is no functionality in Horizon for either a branch, Post Office or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or remove transaction data once it has been recorded in a branch’s accounts.” This was untrue, a high court judge ruled in a landmark court case four years later. In fact, staff at Fujitsu were capable of remotely accessing branch accounts, and had “unrestricted and unaudited” access to those systems, the inquiry heard. A recording from 2013, unearthed by Channel 4 News, shows Susan Crichton, the Post Office’s head lawyer, confirm that Vennells had been briefed about a “covert operations team” that could remotely access the Horizon system and adjust branches’ accounts. The recordings suggest Vennells was aware of claims that remote access to branch accounts was possible two years before prosecutions were halted against post office operators. In 2015 Vennells told the Commons business select committee that “we have no evidence” of miscarriages of justice. Vennells, an ordained Anglican priest, refused to comment when Channel 4 News tracked her down at her parish church over the weekend. In a statement released by her lawyers, she said: “I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system. “I now intend to continue to focus on assisting the inquiry and will not make any further public comment until it has concluded.” Vennells, who has handed back a CBE awarded to her for “services to the Post Office and to charity”, will give evidence, live-streamed here, for three days from Wednesday 22 May. Is the public inquiry enough, or should the police be called in? Nadhim Zahawi, the former chancellor who was one of the MPs questioning Vennells in 2015, has called for a “thorough police investigation”. “I don’t think it’s good enough that we keep falling back on ‘let the inquiry do its work’ – this is much more serious,” he said. “There needs to be an investigation into corporate manslaughter and individuals at the Post Office.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Kevin Hollinrake, the Post Office minister, on Monday told a group of 50 post office operators who reconvened at the village hall in Fenny Compton (where they founded the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance campaign group in 2009) that those responsible “should go to jail”. “People should be prosecuted,” he said. “That’s my view. And I think you and other people I’ve spoken to certainly feel that people within the Post Office and possibly further afield should go to jail.” How much coffee is too much?

For the likes of Laura López, who trades in soft toys and handmade jewellery, the mercaditas are more than simply an income, but an essential community in a country where women spend two-thirds of time on domestic chores or childcare duties, and more than 3,000 women are murdered each year. “The political act of putting ourselves on the streets makes me feel I am not alone,” López says. “On the streets, we are all one.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,649,From the frying pan to the fire: green onions ignite voter anger in South Korea’s elections,"Yoon Suk Yeol is hardly the first elected politician to appear out of touch with ordinary voters during a cost-of-living crisis. But as South Korea prepares for key national assembly elections on Wednesday, its conservative president has been tripped up by a humble vegetable. In recent weeks, green onions have gone from a simple staple of Korean cooking to a powerful symbol of voter anger over rising prices in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy. Its ascent from the kitchen into politics came during Yoon’s recent visit to a supermarket in Seoul that was intended to portray him as someone who understands the financial pressures faced by ordinary families. Yoon said he had been to many markets and described as “reasonable” the store’s 875 won (51p) price tag for a bundle of green onions. Observers were quick to point out, however, that the items had been only temporarily discounted thanks to government subsidies, while the supermarket had made a further price cut. The actual retail price is three to four times higher, hovering at 3,000-4,000 won in recent weeks. Yoon’s People Power party is hoping to take control of the 300-seat assembly from a liberal majority led by the opposition Democratic party but the trip to the shops has added to criticism that Yoon appears aloof. It has fuelled a surge in support for smaller parties that could upset the balance of power and render Yoon a lame-duck leader just two years into his presidency. His party has already been grappling with low approval ratings before the vote, which is being seen as a midterm referendum on Yoon’s administration. It is not just the price of green onions that has seen significant rises. The price of agricultural products in March increased by more than 20% from the same month last year. The price of apples increased by nearly 90%, marking the largest one-year-jump since 1980. Nevertheless, opposition candidates have used green onions as props during campaign speeches to draw attention to Yoon’s hapless attempt to court the average man and woman on the Seoul omnibus. Social media was awash with onion memes, with some users posting photographs of green onions outside polling stations after the National Election Commission banned green onions from the locations, citing concerns over “electoral interference”. “While people’s expression of political views should be respected to the maximum level, using a certain item as a means of expression other than for their original purpose has great potential to affect the election,” the commission said. Hyun Jung, 36, said she hadn’t initially thought about the green onion issue, “but after I heard about the ban, I bought a green onion hairband and I’m determined to wear it on election day”. If Yoon’s party fails to win more seats and take control of the assembly, Yoon risks seeing out the remaining three years of his term struggling to pass his policy agenda. “If the People Power party is still a minority party after the general election … cooperation with the National Assembly will be very difficult,” Kang Joo-hyun, a professor of political science and international relations at Sookmyung Women’s University, told Agence France-Presse. “The president will become a lame duck quickly and … the power of state affairs will be greatly reduced.” In a Gallup survey on 31 March, the opposition Democratic party, led by Lee Jae-myung, was polling slightly ahead of Yoon’s party – 37% to 35%. The opposition parties are framing the votes as “judgment day”, suggesting that it is not just about choosing political candidates but also an opportunity for the public to send a strong message to the government over its handling of the economy. Yoon, whose scandal-hit wife has been conspicuously absent from the campaign, is battling low approval ratings. His popularity did, though, gain momentum after he announced an increase in medical school trainees. The move was criticised by thousands of trainee doctors who have been on strike since February but voters who are worried about the country’s ability to care for its fast-ageing population have supported the move. Disaffection with the political establishment has given smaller parties a rare opportunity to gain ground, including the Rebuilding Korea party, led by former justice minister Cho Kuk. On the eve of the election Cho, whose party is competing only for the 46 seats contested through proportional representation, was polling neck-and-neck with the ruling party, despite being launched only four weeks ago, and is forecast to win between 10 and 15 seats. Securing about 15 seats would enable Cho’s party to potentially form a coalition that could prevent the People Power party from regaining control of the assembly. “If the opposition parties gain a significant number of seats … Yoon regime’s system will be shaken, and cracks will appear,” said Cho. “The People Power party will be divided. The president will become a lame duck, and then a dead duck,” said Cho, who was forced to abandon his presidential ambitions by a 2019 university admissions scandal. Suh Pureunhaneul, a restaurant employee in Seoul, summed up popular disaffection with the established parties, especially over the prohibitive cost of housing in the capital. “It feels like they’re just promoting measures to maintain land prices rather than addressing what I really need,” he said. “Looking at the election, it feels like there’s no one I want to vote for. I wonder if voting would even make a difference.”",2024-04-09 04:55:28,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/09/south-korea-national-assembly-elections-2024-green-onions-supermarket-crisis-cost-of-living,The Guardian,649,hardly first politician appear touch ordinary crisis south korea key national assembly conservative president humble vegetable recent green gone simple staple cooking powerful symbol voter anger rising economy ascent kitchen politics came recent visit supermarket intended portray someone financial faced ordinary said many reasonable 875 51p price tag bundle green quick point however temporarily thanks government supermarket made price cut actual retail price three four time higher hovering 30004000 recent people power party take control 300seat assembly liberal majority led opposition democratic party trip added criticism aloof surge support smaller could upset balance power render lameduck leader two presidency party already grappling low approval vote seen referendum administration price green seen significant price agricultural march 20 month last year price nearly 90 marking since 1980 nevertheless opposition used green prop campaign draw attention hapless attempt court average man woman omnibus social medium awash onion posting green outside polling national election commission green electoral interference expression political maximum level certain item expression original purpose great potential affect election commission said 36 said initially thought green onion issue ban bought green onion hairband determined wear election day party win take control assembly seeing three term struggling pas policy agenda people power party still minority party general election … national assembly difficult kang professor political science international university told president become lame duck quickly … power state greatly reduced survey 31 march opposition democratic party led lee polling slightly ahead party 37 35 opposition framing judgment day suggesting choosing political also opportunity public send strong message government handling economy whose wife conspicuously absent campaign low approval popularity though gain momentum increase medical school move trainee strike since worried ability care population move disaffection political establishment given smaller rare opportunity gain ground korea party led former justice minister cho eve election cho whose party 46 proportional representation polling ruling party despite four ago forecast win 10 15 15 would enable party potentially form coalition could prevent people power party control assembly opposition gain significant number … system shaken appear said cho people power party divided president become lame duck dead duck said cho forced abandon presidential 2019 university scandal restaurant employee summed popular disaffection established especially prohibitive cost housing capital like theyre maintain land rather really need said looking election like there one want vote wonder voting would even make difference pan fire green ignite voter anger south
TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,650,World’s biggest economies pumping billions into fossil fuels in poor nations,"The world’s biggest economies have continued to finance the expansion of fossil fuels in poor countries to the tune of billions of dollars, despite their commitments on the climate. The G20 group of developed and developing economies, and the multilateral development banks they fund, put $142bn (£112bn) into fossil fuel developments overseas from 2020 to 2022, according to estimates compiled by the campaigning groups Oil Change International (OCI) and Friends of the Earth US. Canada, Japan and South Korea were the biggest sources of such finance in the three years studied, and gas received more funding than either coal or oil. The G7 group of biggest economies, to which Japan and Canada belong, pledged in 2022 to halt overseas funding of fossil fuels. But while funding for coal has rapidly diminished, finance for oil and gas projects has continued at a strong pace. Some of the money is going to other developed economies, including Australia, but much of it is to the developing world. However, richer middle income countries still receive more finance than the poorest. The most recent G7 pledge, in the study, is to phase out all overseas fossil fuel funding by the end of 2022. The OCI study concentrates on the period from the beginning of the fiscal year of 2020-21 for each country, to the end of the fiscal year of 2022-23. However, the researchers also found that Japan had continued to make new fossil fuel investments overseas in the past few weeks, up to mid-March 2024, exploiting loopholes in its promise to end fossil fuel funding. The World Bank provided about $1.2bn a year to fossil fuels over the three-year period, of which about two-thirds went to gas projects. The US, Germany and Italy also provided billions in funding a year to overseas fossil fuel projects before the end of 2022-23, according to the report published on Tuesday. The UK supplied about $600m a year on average. Canada supplied just under $11bn a year on average, in the 2020-22 period studied, while South Korea put forward $10bn and Japan about $7bn. Over the same three-year period, the G20 economies put about $104bn into clean energy developments overseas, according to the report. Claire O’Manique, a public finance analyst at OCI, said: “While rich countries continue to drag their feet and claim they can’t afford to fund a globally just energy transition, countries like Canada, Korea, Japan and the US appear to have no shortage of public funds for climate-wrecking fossil fuels. “We must continue to hold wealthy countries accountable for their role in funding the climate crisis, and demand they move first and fastest on a fossil fuel phase-out, to stop funding fossil fuels, and that they pay their fair share of a globally just transition, loss and damage and adaptation finance.” Makiko Arima, a senior finance campaigner at OCI, called on Japan particularly to stop supporting fossil fuels. Japan has lobbied behind the scenes to stop G7 countries adopting a stronger stance on fossil fuels, and in favour of some key projects. Arima said: “Japan is derailing the transition to renewable energy across Asia and globally. Despite its G7 commitment to end fossil fuel financing, its public financial institutions like the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) continue to support new fossil fuel projects, including the Scarborough gasfield in Australia and gas power plants in Mexico. “JBIC is currently investigating a claim that it failed to follow its social and environmental safeguards in developing the Philippines’ first LNG [liquefied natural gas] terminal in Batangas. Japan needs to put people and planet over profit, and shift its finances from fossil fuels to renewables.”",2024-04-09 04:00:43,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/09/worlds-biggest-economies-pumping-billions-into-fossil-fuels-in-poor-nations,The Guardian,650,biggest continued finance expansion fossil poor tune despite climate g20 group multilateral development fund put 142bn £ 112bn fossil fuel overseas 2020 2022 according oil change international earth u canada japan south korea biggest finance three studied gas received either coal oil g7 group biggest japan canada belong 2022 halt overseas fossil coal rapidly finance oil gas continued strong pace money going much world however middle income still receive finance recent g7 pledge study phase overseas fossil fuel end 2022 study period beginning fiscal year 202021 country end fiscal year 202223 however also found japan continued make new fossil fuel overseas past 2024 promise end fossil fuel world bank provided 12bn year fossil period went gas u also provided year overseas fossil fuel end 202223 according report 600m year average canada 11bn year average 202022 period studied south korea put forward 10bn japan 7bn period g20 put 104bn clean energy overseas according report public finance analyst said rich continue drag claim cant afford fund globally energy transition like canada korea japan u appear shortage public fund fossil must continue hold wealthy accountable role climate crisis demand move first fossil fuel stop fossil pay fair share globally transition loss damage adaptation finance senior finance campaigner japan particularly stop supporting fossil japan behind stop g7 stance fossil key said japan transition renewable energy across globally despite g7 commitment end fossil fuel public financial like japan bank international continue support new fossil fuel gas power currently investigating claim follow social environmental first natural gas terminal japan need put people planet profit shift fossil biggest fossil poor
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,651,David Cameron to set out UK basis for continuing arms sales to Israel,"David Cameron will set out the UK’s reasoning for continuing to export arms to Israel on Tuesday as ministers face ongoing pressure to disclose the official legal advice on the trade. The foreign secretary will discuss the Middle East crisis with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken, on a visit to Washington where he is also expected to give an update on the UK’s arms export regime. Downing Street said it had no plans to publish the legal advice but that it wanted to be transparent about its decision to continue exporting arms during the Gaza conflict. “We are obviously aware of the interest in this issue and we will always look to be transparent about our decisions on these matters whilst respecting the longstanding convention that we don’t publish legal advice on these issues,” the prime minister’s official spokesperson said. Rishi Sunak has come under mounting pressure from senior Conservatives – including the veteran peer Nicholas Soames and the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, Alicia Kearns – to suspend weapons exports in light of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The calls follow an attack that killed seven aid workers, including three Britons, who worked for the food charity World Central Kitchen. Keir Starmer also faces pressure to back an end to arms sales after calls for the government to consider immediate action made by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan; the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar; and the Labour MP Margaret Beckett, who was foreign secretary under Tony Blair. The UK’s arms exports regime would prevent the supply of weapons to Israel if there was a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. UK companies provide about 0.02% of Israel’s overall arms imports. The No 10 spokesperson insisted the government was “completely united” over the conflict despite claims of a cabinet split, with Lord Cameron taking a more strident approach to criticism of Israel than some of his colleagues. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, had suggested there was a “bit of relish from some people” about the opportunity to criticise Israel, although No 10 rejected the notion he was referring to Cameron. Mel Stride, a close ally of Sunak, said on Monday that Israel “abides by the rule of law” but – echoing the foreign secretary’s remarks – stressed that UK support for the country was not unconditional. The work and pensions secretary said: “We expect Israel not to do the kinds of things that happened with the aid workers, and we have made it very clear that we are appalled by what happened there.” The Israeli military has withdrawn its forces from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis but could still mount an offensive against Hamas’s last stronghold in Rafah despite the UK and US leading international pleas for restraint. After six months of conflict triggered by the 7 October massacre by Hamas in southern Israel, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Rafah. Any large-scale assault would be likely to lead to a high death toll.

He will hold talks with the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and is hoping to meet the House speaker, Mike Johnson, whose colleagues are preventing the vote on Ukraine aid. “Success for Ukraine and failure for [Vladimir] Putin are vital for American and European security,” Cameron said before his trip. “This will show that borders matter, that aggression doesn’t pay and that countries like Ukraine are free to choose their own future. “The alternative would only encourage Putin in further attempts to re-draw European borders by force, and would be heard clearly in Beijing, Tehran and North Korea.” The UK announced another £2.5bn in aid earlier this year to help Ukraine fight the Russian invasion and the EU has pledged another £43bn.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,652,Nothing beats a good chat – so long as you can walk away when things get awkward | Nell Frizzell,"While on my way to look at an iguanodon skeleton the other day, at the Museum of Natural History in Oxford, I bumped into three people I knew. Each time, I spent about two minutes in the street with them, bathed in watery spring sunshine, having the lightest sort of conversation possible. You know the sort of thing: “How was your Easter? Did you go to that ceilidh on Monday? Aren’t these sunny evenings nice? Did you know you can eat magnolia flowers?” It was perfect. Larry David may hate the stop-and-chat, but I adore it. As someone who is as easy with small talk as I am qualified to perform dentistry in North Korea, I am grateful for the fact that I can just walk away when things, inevitably, get awkward. It’s not a party, I’m not at work; I’m unlikely to get caught with this person for any longer than about five minutes. Moreover, there are buildings, trees and people around to comment on if I forget the person’s name or ask after their boyfriend, who turns out to be their ex-boyfriend, or spit in the air while trying to say the word “sophisticated”. I first bonded with my friend Zuhura over our love of the stop-and-chat. At the time, she was living on a boat; the entire Thames footpath was essentially her doorstep so she spent her life having golden nuggets of social interaction with people who were in transit. It could be political, flirtatious, heartfelt or polite, but it was always on the hoof. To have a preplanned, static conversation can sometimes be a little too intense, a bit staged. You think too much about what you are wearing, what time you will be able to eat, if you have something caught in your nostril and whether you should have sat outside. With the stop-and-chat, you each get the other as they are. It is what embeds you in a community, a landscape and a language. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get going.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,653,"A show to relish: Tomato, the dance spectacular about lust that’s a bit like a food fight","‘How to choose tomatoes?” asks the voiceover, as three bodies writhe around the stage. “How to find the fake, acquired and invented tomato? First, the leaves. Second, the shape. Third, feel with your hand. Fourth, check the bottom. Good luck and enjoy your tomato.” The dancers twist and turn, squeezing and sucking tomatoes, throwing them or pouring a bucket of them over themselves. A live camera brings the audience into the show as the performers dance together in movements that are abstract, absurd, lustful, funny and confronting. “Every time we’re on stage,” says Chou Kuan-Jou, the Taiwanese dancer-choreographer who created the show, “we can really feel the energy from the audience because we have a lot of eye contact with them.” The show, named Tomato, is an experimental dance piece exploring sexuality, gender and desire, all influenced by how sexism, shyness and feminism affect her home country. Tomato drew rave reviews at its 2022 Edinburgh fringe festival debut, and is now returning to the UK for two shows at the Taiwan festival in London. Its creator is a young Taiwan-born artist who teaches schoolchildren and elderly women dance, as well as working with disability advocacy groups. Speaking from Taipei, Chou says Tomato was first inspired by discussions about menstruation, pregnancy, sexuality and social expectations. But as she began exploring her own sexuality, the show has morphed and the lineup has changed. Reviewers have noted the “sudden shifts” in the mood of the show, which seem to have left audiences delightfully shocked, but also a little confused by the multiple themes and the chaotically abstract performance. Chou suggests that this is a fair reflection of her own changing experience in terms of the subject matter. “Tomato is about exploring lust with a sexualising body and experimenting with the fluidity of it. In these three years, the show has been changing with my life, my personal body experience.” Tomato has also taken on darker themes, as Chou learned of disturbing online trends in Taiwan and Korea, from the sharing of videos showing violence against women to Taiwan’s belated #MeToo movement. The latter has drawn in dozens of high-profile figures, sparked a nationwide conversation and prompted changes in the law. The conversation was good and necessary, Chou says, but she would have liked to see it go further, pushing against social conservatism to more freely discuss sex and desire, particularly for women, groups such as the LGBTQ+ community and people with disabilities. Instead, it was framed around victims and perpetrators. “What about the complexity of sexuality?” she says. “That’s my goal right now, to open the discussion.” Chou says the show received a very different reception in Edinburgh, where it was met with laughter. “Sometimes I feel it’s too much,” she says. As for her more conservative home country, she says: “In Taiwan, I can feel the insecurity and intense atmosphere in the audience. They are like a big wall I have to punch through. A lot of people stay for the Q&A section, but I sense they don’t know how to transform their feelings and thoughts into words because the discussion of desire or sexuality is not really familiar in Taiwan.” Chou says her school pupils sometimes come to her for advice, or let her know they’ve seen her work online. Members of her Chinese cultural dance class have come to her shows, but they are often too shy to talk about what they saw. Another work, Free Touch, invites members of the public to sit with her and be open to making and receiving physical contact. She recently took it to Perth, Australia, setting up in a corner of Hyde Park, where some extraordinary moments of interaction occurred. “It’s a play on boundaries and trust, of intimacy in the public space. It also reminds me of a Tinder date, because sometimes you can really feel the connection.” Chou acknowledges that there is an element of risk involved. “Yeah, it’s dangerous,” she says. “But I want to see the dangers and understand them.” She pauses then adds: “I’ve also signed up for martial arts.”  The Taiwan festival runs for 15 days from 12 April at London’s Coronet theatre.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,654,"Ex-defence ministers ‘wrong’ to say UK unprepared for war, deputy PM says","Former defence ministers are wrong to issue a stark warning that the UK is unprepared for war as a “whole-nation endeavour”, the deputy prime minister has said. The outgoing defence minister, James Heappey, called on ministers to do more to prepare for conflict just weeks after resigning from his Ministry of Defence (MoD) post, saying the UK has failed to prepare for war. His former boss Ben Wallace echoed his sentiments, suggesting some in government are just hoping threats to the UK “will go away”. Labour has described it as “an alarming admission”, adding: “The cost of Tory chaos is a government that doesn’t take the UK’s defence seriously.” Oliver Dowden hit back, saying “they are wrong”. He told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg show: “We are taking action across the board. We have set up a national cybersecurity centre in respect of cyber. I now take dozens of decisions daily about investment to protect our economic security. “This world is going to get more dangerous as time goes on. We see a combination of hostile states, not least Russia, Iran, North Korea and China. “We need to be taking action across those areas. Of course there is always more to do, but I believe we are making good progress against rising threat.” Heappeywrote in the Sunday Telegraph that the UK was behind its allies who have taken steps to reinforce citizens’ preparedness for war. He wrote that he had urged ministers to prepare for conflict and take part in a “whole of government” exercise, first championed by Wallace, to practice evacuating to a bunker because of the “growing instability and insecurity directed at Britain”. But only MoD officials took part, despite certain cabinet ministers having access to reserved beds and desks in the UK’s wartime bunker. “It’s a stark reminder that war is a whole-nation endeavour and, to be frank, in the UK we’re a very long way behind,” he wrote. Wallace echoed his criticisms in the newspaper, saying there were too many people in the government relying on hoping the current instability would go away. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He said: “The growing instability and insecurity directed at Britain and her allies means that the whole of society needs to make a step change towards recognising that our core duty is to think about our defence and our resilience. “It’s how we used to think during the cold war, and everyone from local government to the MoD played their part.” A Labour spokesperson said: “Since 2010, the Conservatives hollowed out our armed forces, cut the army to its smallest size since Napoleon, wasted billions of pounds in defence procurement, and overseen service morale fall to record lows.“Labour knows the first duty of any government is to keep the nation safe and protect our citizens. We will always do what’s required to defend this country.” The government has belatedly started reviewing its national plan for the defence of the UK in the event of a war, after mounting threats of conflict. Heappey has called for a focus on strategic resilience including securing food and energy supples, more money for defence, and repurposing industry to build weapons.

The jury delivered the verdict in federal court after a two-week trial after hearing closing arguments earlier in the day. The Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon did not attend the trial, as he has been detained in Montenegro since March 2023. He was intercepted while on his way to Dubai on the lam from authorities in multiple countries, traveling using forged Costa Rican travel documents. The SEC accused both Terraform and Kwon of duping investors in 2021 about the stability of TerraUSD, a stable coin designed to maintain a value of $1. The regulator also alleged both had falsely claimed Terraform’s blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app. The regulator is seeking civil financial penalties and orders barring Kwon and Terraform from the securities industry. Laura Meehan, the SEC attorney, said during closing arguments that the platform’s success story was “built on lies”. “If you swing big and you miss, and you don’t tell people that you came up short. That is fraud,” Meehan said. Louis Pellegrino, an attorney for Terraform, told the jury on Friday the SEC’s case relied on statements taken out of context and that Terraform and Kwon had been truthful about their products and how they worked, even when they failed. The company issued a statement after the verdict: “We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.” Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, did not attend the trial, which began 25 March. Both the US and South Korea, where Kwon is a citizen, have sought his extradition on criminal charges. Montenegro’s top court is evaluating the competing calls for his extradition. Kwon’s attorneys have advocated for extradition to South Korea in hopes of a lighter sentence. However, Montenegro’s government plans to approve extradition to the US, Bloomberg reported. Kwon designed the cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and Luna, a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD. The SEC estimates investors lost more than $40bn on the two tokens combined when the TerraUSD peg to the dollar could not be maintained in May 2022. Their collapse also dragged down the value of other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, and caused wider havoc in the crypto market, leading several companies to file for bankruptcy in 2022. Terraform itself filed for bankruptcy protection in January. The SEC has said Kwon and Terraform secretly arranged to have a third party purchase large amounts of TerraUSD to prop up the price when the stable coin slipped from its peg a year earlier, in May 2021. Kwon falsely attributed the recovery to the reliability of TerraUSD’s algorithms, according to the regulator. Terraform’s attorney said on Friday that Terraform had disclosed TerraUSD’s peg needed to be defended in May 2021. He said the Korean payments app had used the company’s blockchain, but the technical details of how it did so were not important to investors. US financial regulators have been keen to crack down on shady crypto moguls in recent months. The ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money late last week. His company is still in the thick of contentious bankruptcy proceedings. Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said in a statement on Friday: “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance.”",2024-04-06 15:50:10,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/05/ceo-crypto-crash-fraud-terraform-do-kwan,The Guardian,655,jury found former liable civil fraud agreeing u exchange commission firm misled 2022 collapse namesake jury verdict federal court trial hearing day founder attend trial since march 2023 way lam multiple traveling forged costa travel sec accused 2021 stability stable coin designed maintain value 1 regulator also falsely used popular mobile payment regulator seeking civil financial barring industry laura sec attorney said success story built swing big miss dont tell people came short fraud said attorney told jury case taken context truthful worked even company statement verdict disappointed verdict believe evidence continue maintain sec legal authority bring case carefully weighing next march 2023 attend trial 25 march u south korea citizen sought extradition criminal top court extradition extradition south korea lighter sentence however government approve extradition u designed luna traditional token value closely linked sec lost 40bn two combined peg dollar could may 2022 collapse also dragged value havoc market leading several file bankruptcy 2022 bankruptcy protection sec said secretly third party purchase large prop price stable coin slipped peg year may 2021 falsely recovery reliability according regulator attorney said disclosed peg may 2021 said used technical important u financial keen crack shady recent sam 25 federal prison wire fraud conspiracy launder money late last week company still thick contentious bankruptcy director division enforcement said statement devastating market value nearly overnight lack registration compliance real real people hard work team continue use disposal protect public high time come compliance fugitive center 2022 crash found liable fraud
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,656,"Russia-Ukraine war live: 20 members of Russian airfield personnel killed or injured in drone attack, Kyiv says – as it happened","Ukrainian officials claimed on Friday that the drone strike targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia had killed or injured 20 members of personnel. The officials, speaking on anonymity to the AP because they were not authorised to publicly discuss the operation, had also said the attack destroyed at least six military aircrafts and badly damaged eight others. However, Russian defence officials claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. It has just turned 6pm in Ukraine and Russia. Here are the key events you might have missed from the day: A Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia has killed or injured 20 members of airfield personnel and destroyed six Russian warplanes, as well as badly damaging eight others, according to officials in Kyiv. Russian defence officials, however, have claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged in the barrage. The Guardian could not independently verify either side’s claims. A Russian airstrike on Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia has killed two people and injured six others, according to local governor. A series of blasts had been reported in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday. Reuters reported earlier in the day that Ukraine’s air force shot down all 13 drones used in Russia’s overnight attack on the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk, though nothing had been said about the missiles. Russian investigators claimed to have found pro-Ukraine data on the phone of one of the Moscow terror attack suspects, despite evidence that an offshoot of the Islamic State (IS) was responsible. Russia’s investigative committee said that data from one of the suspects’ phones showed that on the morning of 24 February this year – the second anniversary of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine – he had trawled for photographs of the Crocus City Hall and sent it to others. It said the suspect “had confirmed all this in his statements” and also said they had found photos showing men in camouflage holding the Ukrainian flag in front of destroyed buildings. Human rights experts however have warned that any statements or confessions from the suspects should be met with scepticism given that the men appeared to have been repeatedly tortured, according to gruesome videos and photographs circulating of their interrogations. A Russian governor was hospitalised after being stabbed, a spokesperson has said. Andrey Chibis, governor of far northern Murmansk was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in the town of Apatity, where he had been holding a meeting. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had “come around” after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. Chibis is a member of the United Russia ruling party and has governed Murmansk region since 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin’s Ukraine offensive. Russian forces have taken control of a settlement named Vodyane in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, according to a Russia’s defence ministry statement. The ministry provided no further ddetails of the settlement. Authorities in Russia’s eastern city of Khabarovsk declared a state of emergency in an area where a “radiation source” was found, according to Russian news agency TASS reports. It said elevated radiation levels were detected near a power pylon, approximately 2.5km (1.5 miles) from residential buildings. It also said radiation levels would be monitored for the next two days and the source of the radiation would be investigated, but nobody has been injured or exposed to radiation so far. The Kremlin called French President Emmanuel Macron’s assertions that Russia plans to disrupt the Olympics “absolutely unfounded.” Macron said on Thursday that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. When asked about Russia’s threat to the games by a reporter, Macron said, “I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information.” The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organisation said that a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian-held town of Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. In a post on X, MSF said it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”. Ukrainian military drones attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, but no serious damage was detected, Russian state media has reported, citing the plant’s press service. The Guardian could not independently verify the alleged incident. In the past, both sides have accused one other of shelling the plant, none of whose six reactors are operating. Japan announced new sanctions against Russia. Japan’s trade ministry announced the decision to ban exports of 164 goods to Russia, including automobile engine oil and optical equipment. They are also expected to ban imports of Russian nonindustrial diamonds. The Ukrainian military denied that Russian forces had entered the suburbs of Chasiv Yar, a town in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, but said there was fighting ongoing in the area. “The situation there is very difficult, the fighting continues, but they are not there,” Andriy Zadubinnyi, spokesman for Ukraine’s eastern command told Reuters. Russia’s RIA news agency cited an adviser to the Russian-appointed regional head earlier as saying that Russian forces were in the suburb of Chasiv Yar. A Russian air attack on Ukraine’s southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed two people and injured six more, the regional governor said on Friday afternoon. A nine-year-old boy and his mother were among the injured, Ivan Fedorov added on Telegram. An image posted by the governor showed a cafe with shattered windows. A series of blasts was reported in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday. The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) humanitarian organisation said on Friday that a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian-held town of Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. In a post on X, MSF said it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”. “This attack on our office is far from being an isolated incident. The destruction of civilian infrastructure has been a hallmark of this war for a long time,” says Vincenzo Porpiglia, emergency coordinator for MSF in Ukraine.” Ukrainian police said five civilians were wounded in the strike. 🔴 BREAKING: Today, on 5 April at around 3 am, our office in Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, was bombed and completely destroyed.

Five civilians who were close to the office were injured... 🧵#WarInUkraine pic.twitter.com/hkFlP4ekWB Arsenal defender Oleksandr Zichenko says he would leave the Premier League to fight in Ukraine if he were called up by his country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week signed into law a measure lowering the country’s army mobilisation age from 27 to 25, the country’s parliament said on its website. Professional footballer Zinchenko, who has won 60 caps for Ukraine, told BBC’s Newsnight programme he would answer a call-up. “I think it’s a clear answer. I would go (to fight)“, he said. He added that former school friends were involved in the conflict. “It’s tough to understand that just recently we’ve been in the same school, we were playing in the playground or on the football pitch, and now they have to defend our country,” he said. The 27-year-old former Manchester City player told the BBC he had donated about £1m ($1.25m) to help people in his country since Russia’s invasion in 2022. “I know maybe some people might think that it’s much easier … for me being here (in London) rather than being there (in Ukraine),” he said. “I really hope that this war will end soon.” Ukrainian military drones have attacked Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, but no serious damage has been detected, Russian state media reports, citing plant’s press service.

More updates to come … Russia has summoned the South Korean ambassador to protest over sanctions by Seoul against Russian individuals and legal entities, the Russian foreign ministry said on Friday. South Korea has imposed sanctions against two Russian vessels which it says were carrying military cargo to North Korea. Seoul said on Tuesday that it had also sanctioned two Russian organisations and two Russian citizens linked to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Russia considers South Korea’s decision as an unfriendly move and will respond in due course. Russia is very likely to have been behind disturbances affecting GPS navigation in the Baltic region, Germany’s defence ministry said today. “The persistent disruptions to the global navigation satellite system are very likely of Russian origin and are based on disruptions in the electromagnetic spectrum, including those originating in the Kaliningrad Oblast,” a spokesperson for the ministry told Reuters. Three civilians have been injured in Kherson, Ukrinform reported. “The Russian troops attacked Beryslav again using a drone. Three people sustained injuries from the explosives that were dropped,” Kherson’s regional military administration said. A former city councillor and member of the Massachusetts national guard who is wanted in the US on child sexual abuse image charges has fled the country and joined the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Wilmer Puello-Mota, 28, former city councillor of Holyoke, Massachusetts, went missing on 7 January, two days before he was scheduled to appear in court in Rhode Island in possession of child sexual abuse images and obstruction of justice charges. This week, Puello-Mota resurfaced at an enlistment centre in the Russian region of Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, where he was captured on film signing a military contract. Read the rest of the story here: The governor of Russia’s far northern Murmansk region was in hospital on Friday after being stabbed by a man, his spokesperson said. Andrey Chibis, 45, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in the town of Apatity, where he had been holding a meeting. “Now he is in post-operative condition. It is too early to make predictions on his recovery and how long it will take,” Liliya Sechkina told Russian state TV. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had “come around” after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. The attacker was detained and is expected to undergo “psychiatric examinations”, investigators said. They added, “During interrogation, the man explained that he had committed the attack because he felt dislike for the governor, although he did not know him personally,.” Chibis is a member of the United Russia ruling party and has governed Murmansk region since 2019.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,657,Israel to reopen Erez crossing into Gaza | First Thing,"Good morning. The office of the Israeli prime minister has said that the Erez crossing, which lies in northern Gaza and for years served as the only passenger terminal for people to move in and out of the territory, will be temporarily reopened in an effort to increase the flow of humanitarian aid. More aid will also be allowed through the port of Ashdod, which lies about 25 miles north of Gaza, and authorities will further allow “increased Jordanian aid through Kerem Shalom”, a border crossing in southern Israel. Today’s announcement came just hours after Joe Biden called for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza, telling Benjamin Netanyahu in a testy meeting that future US support for Israel would depend on it taking concrete action to protect civilians and aid workers. How did the US react to today’s announcement? Antony Blinken welcomed the steps, but remained cautious. The US secretary of state said: “These are positive developments but the real test is results.” What’s going on at the UN regarding this conflict? The UN Human Rights Council was today debating whether to demand a halt in arms sales to Israel “to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights”. A report by Microsoft’s threat intelligence team said Chinese state-backed cyber groups would probably target high-profile elections in 2024 with artificial intelligence-generated content. China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January – the first time Microsoft has seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft. Voting rights groups have filed a federal lawsuit against Alabama to block enforcement of a new law that criminalizes some kinds of voter assistance with absentee ballots. A federal judge has ruled that a group of migrants who were sent to Martha’s Vineyard in 2022 by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, can sue the plane company that transported them. Prostate cancer cases worldwide are projected to double to 2.9m a year by 2040, with annual deaths predicted to rise by 85%, a study has found. A federal judge has denied Donald Trump’s attempts to have his classified records case dismissed on the contention that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to transform them as personal property and possess them at his Mar-a-Lago club. Despite efforts to improve air quality before the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, air pollution is still far worse in China than in many developed countries. About half of China’s cities failed to meet their own national standards in 2019 – let alone those from the World Health Organization. Despite the country’s comprehensive action plans, researchers have said air pollution deaths in China will begin to rise soon without accelerated action. “For China to even just tread water, it needs to reduce air pollution even more aggressively,” said Prof Michael Brauer from the University of British Columbia. In Tennessee, Republicans have accelerated their attacks on democratic norms, most recently expelling two Black Democratic lawmakers calling for gun reform from the state House of Representatives. They’ve maintained conservative domination in the state with gerrymandered districts, disenfranchised voters and an increasing sense of political despair – in many cases, insulating themselves from political consequences. “The leadership in the state is not the old guard,” said Dr Sekou Franklin, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University. “They’re an extreme version of conservatives who believe that they have broad sovereignty to govern, in many respects irrespective of what goes on in the national government.” In many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, hyenas are feared and denigrated. In the folklore of the Ethiopian highlands, people with the “evil eye” turn into hyenas at night and attack their neighbors. But in Harar, a walled city in eastern Ethiopia, hyenas are welcomed, acting as the city’s garbage-disposal system, entering at night through a series of “hyena doors” built into the walls and eating entrails dumped in the streets. US banks are sabotaging their climate commitments to cut back on emissions by continuing to finance meat, dairy and feed corporations, a report has found. The report has linked more than 24m metric tonnes of CO2 – about equal to the annual emissions from 5m cars – to animal protein and feed company financing by what it calls the “big three” livestock lenders: Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. “Banks have committed to pathways to net zero, but they are ignoring a huge cow-shaped hole in their plans,” said Monique Mikhail at Friends of the Earth. Adrienne Matei took on the 30-plants-a-week challenge, inspired by a 2018 study that found that those who eat a wide variety of plant foods have better gut health and that instead of the classic “five a day” goal people should strive to eat 30 plants a week. But could the challenge be easier for Adrienne than it seems, given that even a small quantity of the plant counts – and substances like coffee and tea technically go toward the tally?

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,658,"China will use AI to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India, Microsoft warns","China will attempt to disrupt elections in the US, South Korea and India this year with artificial intelligence-generated content after making a dry run with the presidential poll in Taiwan, Microsoft has warned. The US tech firm said it expected Chinese state-backed cyber groups to target high-profile elections in 2024, with North Korea also involved, according to a report by the company’s threat intelligence team published on Friday. “As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections,” the report reads. Microsoft said that “at a minimum” China will create and distribute through social media AI-generated content that “benefits their positions in these high-profile elections”. The company added that the impact of AI-made content was minor but warned that could change. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line,” said Microsoft. Microsoft said in the report that China had already attempted an AI-generated disinformation campaign in the Taiwan presidential election in January. The company said this was the first time it had seen a state-backed entity using AI-made content in a bid to influence a foreign election. A Beijing-backed group called Storm 1376, also known as Spamouflage or Dragonbridge, was highly active during the Taiwanese election. Its attempts to influence the election included posting fake audio on YouTube of the election candidate Terry Gou – who had bowed out in November – endorsing another candidate. Microsoft said the clip was “likely AI generated”. YouTube removed the content before it reached many users. The Beijing-backed group pushed a series of AI-generated memes about the ultimately successful candidate, William Lai – a pro-sovereignty candidate opposed by Beijing – that levelled baseless claims against Lai accusing him of embezzling state funds. There was also an increased use of AI-generated TV news anchors, a tactic that has also been used by Iran, with the “anchor” making unsubstantiated claims about Lai’s private life including fathering illegitimate children. Microsoft said the news anchors were created by the CapCut tool, which is developed by Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok. Microsoft added that Chinese groups continue to mount influence campaigns in the US. It said Beijing-backed actors are using social media accounts to pose “divisive questions” and attempt to understand issues dividing US voters. “This could be to gather intelligence and precision on key voting demographics ahead of the US Presidential election,” said Microsoft in a blog post accompanying the report. One post on X, formerly Twitter, referred to a $118bn bipartisan bill in the US that combined a $20bn of investment in the US-Mexico border with a $75bn package for Ukraine and Israel. It asked: “What’s your reaction?” Another flagged the loss of an F-35 fighter in South Carolina last year, saying “only under the Biden administration” could a valuable piece of military hardware be lost – although debris was found soon after – and asked “what do you think about this?” The report was published in the same week that a White House-appointed official review board said “a cascade of errors” by Microsoft let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior US officials. Last month, the US and UK governments accused China-backed hackers of waging a years-long cyber campaign targeting politicians, journalists and businesses, as well as the UK’s election watchdog.",2024-04-05 04:00:04,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/05/china-using-ai-disrupt-elections,The Guardian,658,china attempt disrupt u south korea year artificial content making dry run presidential poll u tech firm said target 2024 north korea also involved according report threat intelligence team south korea united head likely see influence extent north work toward report said minimum china create distribute social medium content company added impact content minor could change impact content swaying remains low increasing experimentation audio continue may prove effective line said said report china already campaign presidential election company said first time seen entity content bid influence foreign election group storm 1376 also known highly active election influence election included posting fake audio election candidate terry bowed another candidate said clip likely ai removed content many group series ultimately successful candidate lai candidate opposed baseless lai state fund also use news tactic also used anchor making unsubstantiated private life illegitimate said news tool company owner added continue mount influence u said social medium pose divisive attempt understand dividing u could gather intelligence precision key voting ahead u presidential election said post report one post x formerly twitter 118bn bipartisan bill u combined 20bn investment border 75bn package whats reaction another loss f35 fighter south last year saying administration could valuable piece military hardware lost although debris found soon think report week white official review board said cascade let break senior u last month u accused campaign well election watchdog china use ai disrupt u south korea
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,659,"Russia-Ukraine war: We need to do more to help Ukraine, Nato chief says – as it happened","Wrapping up a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that the situation in the battlefield in Ukraine remains serious and that Ukraine needs more air defences and assistance. We need to do even more, he said, adding that support needs to be put on a more enduring basis. Nato foreign ministers met for a second day in Brussels, marking the 75th anniversary of the alliance’s founding. The ministers held talks with Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister. Kuleba stressed Ukraine’s call for more air defences. “Saving Ukrainian lives, saving Ukrainian economy, saving Ukrainian cities depends on the availability of Patriots and other air defence systems in Ukraine. He also emphasised that “providing Patriots depends on allies, they have plenty of them.” The Ukrainian minister also said he spoke with the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and “urged our American partners to find ways to provide additional ‘Patriot’ air defence systems as soon as possible.” The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that “we heard loud and clear what the foreign minister said” and that Berlin will ask allies to check if they can provide more air defences. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, has said that “without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also reiterated the need for air defences. “Strengthening Ukraine’s air defence capabilities directly translates into saving lives,” he said on social media. After the ministers’ meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, emphasised that more needs to be done to help Ukraine. Allies will now go back and look into their inventories to see if there’s any way to provide more air defence systems, Stoltenberg. The Nato chief also said allies should be able to establish a stronger, more robust framework for long-term support for Ukraine, so aid can continue on a more predictable basis. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, said that four people were killed and 12 were wounded in Russian drone attacks. Around 350,000 residents were without power in the Kharkiv region following the overnight drone attack, the Ukrainian energy ministry said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. Stoltenberg also said he opposes any attempt by Georgia’s government to introduce a law on foreign agents. The situation on the battlefield is difficult, Jens Stoltenberg said, stressing that there is an urgency when it comes to mobilising ore support for Ukraine. If more support is not mobilised, there is a risk that Russia captures more territory, he warned. The Ukrainians have demonstrated they are extremely capable of using the equipment provided by Nato allies, he said. The Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said allies need to do two things: mobilise more support for Kyiv in the coming days and weeks, and but then also ensure that we’re able to establish a stronger, more robust framework for long-term support, so aid can continue on a more predictable basis. The Nato chief reiterated that the alliance’s military leadership has been tasked with coming up with a structure, which would have to be underpinned by a financial commitment. He declined to go into more detail about plans. Asked about Ukraine’s ask for more air defences, Jens Stoltenberg said allies understand the urgency. Allies will now go back and look into their inventories to see if there’s any way to provide more systems, including Patriots, he said. It’s partly a question of systems, and partly a question of delivering interceptors, the Nato chief said, stressing recent announcements of extra support. Wrapping up a two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers, the alliance’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that the situation in the battlefield in Ukraine remains serious and that Ukraine needs more air defences and assistance. We need to do even more, he said, adding that support needs to be put on a more enduring basis. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, has said that “without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism.” In a sharply-worded thread on social media, the outspoken minister said that “comforting stories can help win elections. But if they are false they immobilise us, prevent us from taking real action, while Ukrainians continue to die for us.” He added: “There is little mystery about what can happen if we keep waiting for a miracle. Territories can be lost, countries can be occupied. There is no positive spin to this story, no happy ending, unless we choose to rewrite this scrip.” Nice stories don’t win wars. Without significant deliveries of weapons and real security guarantees the glorious narrative of unity and solidarity with Ukraine is wearing thin and rapidly approaching cynicism. 🧵👇 Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, will soon address reporters. Stay tuned. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke with the American secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and “urged our American partners to find ways to provide additional ‘Patriot’ air defense systems as soon as possible.” Kuleba also noted that they “discussed next steps in the coming days and weeks to unlock supplemental US aid for Ukraine.” I was pleased to meet with @SecBlinken in Brussels to express my gratitude to the United States for all of its assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale aggression.I briefed Secretary Blinken on Russia's increased air terror against Ukrainian cities and… pic.twitter.com/8WcdgBwF1D Speaking alongside her Ukrainian counterpart, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said at Nato headquarters that “we heard loud and clear what the foreign minister said and I also would like to underline, we see what’s happening in Ukraine, realising that you need this air defence now.” She added: “We will call in Europe again that everybody has to check where their air defence is, what they can provide for Ukraine.” Together with @ABaerbock we have just attended the NATO-Ukraine council meeting in Brussels. Ukraine’s greatest need right now is to urgently strengthen air defense. I thank Germany and other allies for answering the call and taking action right away. pic.twitter.com/wgfs96Mv9k Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said China has proposed the most reasonable peace plan so far for resolving the Ukraine conflict, Reuters reported. “The most important thing for us is that the Chinese document is based on an analysis of the reasons for what is happening and the need to eliminate these root causes. It is structured in logic from the general to the specific,” state news agency RIA quoted Lavrov saying. “This plan was criticized for being vague... But this is a reasonable plan that the great Chinese civilization proposed for discussion,” he said. The EU has fired a warning shot at the Georgian government after it announced it was resurrecting a bill on “foreign agents” that it abandoned last year after critics compared it to current Russian laws silencing criticism in the media. In a statement the EU’s external service reminded Georgia that “ensuring media freedom” was one of the “crucial” conditions of the EU membership process. “The European Union recalls the public pledge of the Georgian government and the ruling party from last year to “unconditionally withdraw” such legislation. The EU regrets that it is once again being considered despite strong public and international reactions in March 2023,” it said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that critics of the draft law “need to more actively explain the absurdity of considering this a Russian project”. Peskov added that Russia wants “stability and predictability” in Georgia, and defended the proposed law, saying: “No state wants interference from other countries in domestic politics; this is normal practice.” Romania’s foreign minister, Luminița Odobescu, has called for “ambitious actions” to support Ukraine.

Our purpose at the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership,” Blinken told reporters in Brussels on Thursday. Russian troops launched a wave of Shahed drones against Ukraine’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, overnight. Four people were killed and 12 were wounded, the regional governor has said. Watch the latest footage from the attack: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Paris Olympics this summer. When asked about Russia’s threat to the Olympics by a reporter, Macron said, “I have no doubt whatsoever, including in terms of information.” His comment, delivered at an event in Paris for the inauguration of the new Olympics aquatic centre, is the most explicit acknowledgement to date of foreign threats to the security of the games. Macron has recently adopted a tougher stance on the war, vowing that Moscow must be defeated, although he has made clear that France has no intention of instigating hostilities against Russia. Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said France will propose EU-wide level sanctions on those behind spreading “disinformation”. The Finnish government will extend the closure of border crossings with Russia until further notice, the government said today, Reuters reported. “We are working with our partners to strengthen the protection of our cities and villages and to protect our citizens,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said this morning. “Strengthening Ukraine’s air defense capabilities directly translates into saving lives,” he stressed.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,661,"Australia faces postwar-style reconstruction to reach net zero target, Greg Combet says","Australia faces a postwar-scale reconstruction costing hundreds of billions of dollars in private and public investment to reach net zero emissions by mid-century, according to the former Labor climate minister and incoming Future Fund chair, Greg Combet. Speaking at the National Press Club, Combet said the Net Zero Economy Authority – a new government agency proposed to help manage the country’s transformation from a dirty to a clean economy – was putting together a “pipeline” of clean industrial projects and would be “figuring out how to help bring them to concrete investment decisions”. Combet was speaking as the chair of the Net Zero Economy Agency, which was set up to design the authority and begin its work. Legislation to create the authority was tabled in parliament last week. A former union boss and cabinet minister in the Gillard government, Combet will leave the agency next month to succeed Peter Costello as the chair of the Future Fund, the country’s $212bn sovereign wealth fund. He said the authority had been designed to play a coordinating role in helping Australia become a renewable energy “superpower”, initially focusing on emissions-intensive parts of the country that were home to ageing coal-fired power plants that were near the end of their life. A key part of its job would be ensuring workers and communities were supported through the change and shared in the benefits, he said. “If we do this well, Australia has the opportunity to develop numerous new clean industrial projects, involving billions of investment dollars and providing thousands of jobs,” he said. “Neither government funding nor private capital alone can meet this challenge.” Combet said the agency had been involved “in the policy discussion” in the lead-up to next month’s budget, and the government had indicated it would “look to capitalise on Australia’s comparative advantage in minerals and renewable energy, aiming to encourage large-scale investment in green industrial production”. He suggested that the government and its funding bodies would need to look beyond grants and concessional loans, and should consider direct investments in “particularly large transformative projects” when necessary. “Governments may need to consider being significant equity players, helping to de-risk projects and adopting a long-term view before recovering capital,” he said. Anthony Albanese has indicated the government plans to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act, which includes A$570bn in clean incentives, but acknowledges it cannot compete with it on dollar terms. The government promised $2bn for green hydrogen production in last year’s budget and last week announced $1bn for solar manufacturing. Some economists have questioned whether these investments were well targeted given the scale of investment under way elsewhere, particularly in China and the US, and suggested Australia should focus on industries in which it could have a natural advantage, such as green iron. Combet said the US legislation had “changed the game”, and the European Union, Japan and Korea had followed with “unprecedented investments in their industrial base”. “The race is on to secure the industries of the future,” he said. “Australia needs to respond, and we are.” Sign up to Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion He said the agency had begun work in Gladstone and the central Queensland region, which produces more than 40% of the state’s energy and is home to nearly half of the country’s coalmines. He said it was an example of a place that would feel the impact of what was coming but where there could be new opportunities. “It’s a major producer of key industrial products like cement, alumina, aluminium and ammonia, and it’s a major trade hub, with the Port of Gladstone facilitating tens of billions of dollars of trade every year in exports of coal, gas and aluminium to our trading partners,” he said. “In my view, successfully transforming the region around Gladstone, and similar regions around the country, must be a key national endeavour.” He said the authority legislation included a funded redeployment scheme. The body would support workers “to acquire skills, to access new employment if needed, to help create jobs in new businesses and industries”, he said. “The touchstone will be how well we handle the closure of coal-fired power stations,” he said.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,662,"Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators review – boisterous, blues-soaked rock’n’roll","A 2011 episode of South Park took playful aim at Slash, parodying the Guns N’ Roses guitarist as a mythical Dutch legend called Vunter Slaush with the ability to perform everywhere at once. There’s truth in every joke. Between shows in South Korea and the Philippines, Slash made an impromptu appearance at the Academy Awards, flanking Ryan Gosling with a honeyburst Les Paul guitar for a performance of I’m Just Ken from the Oscar-nominated Barbie. While testament to his enduring mainstream appeal, tonight is a more orthodox setting for the legendary, top-hatted guitarist. Wolfgang Van Halen – son of late guitar hero Eddie – also rubbed shoulders with Gosling in Hollywood, and it’s his band Mammoth WVH supporting Slash and co on this latest global trek. Their brand of muscular, belligerent rock showcases Van Halen’s supreme talent, but they fail to fully ignite in a confusingly short, six-song set. Not to be confused with Slash’s other, snappier solo namesake, simply “Slash” – with which he’s recently announced an all-star blues covers album called Orgy of the Damned – “Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators” encompasses a body of work written with Alter Bridge’s Kennedy, the American hard-rock heavyweights’ much-lauded vocalist. What Kennedy lacks in attitude and the unpredictability of an Axl Rose or a Scott Weiland, he makes up for with a supple, powerhouse range perfectly suited to Slash’s bluesy pomp. Taken from the band’s latest album, 4, C’est la Vie marries Kennedy’s honeyed vocals with the guitarist’s wah-wah-heavy riffs, as he stomps around the drum riser in his Converse shoes. Since Slash cowrote it, a breezy cover of Lenny Kravitz’s Always on the Run fits in seamlessly with its swaggering rhythms. If tonight is mainly about the guitarist, then soaring power ballad Bent to Fly is all about Kennedy, as he unleashes his spectacular caterwaul. Bassist Todd Kerns has a decent set of pipes himself – he takes lead vocals for a few songs, including GNR’s Bad Apples from 1991. Wicked Stone is the band’s best song, on account of its bluesy brawn and devil-may-care riffs – it’s mesmerising to watch him in full flow, but Slash’s extended 10-minute solo is excessive. “This is why we do it,” Kennedy says, “for crowds like you. You guys are outstanding.” Born Saul Hudson in London and partly raised up the road in Stoke-on-Trent, Slash obviously has a knack for side hustles. The irony is that whether by accident or design, he’s cultivated a brand in that wherever the frizzy-haired man wearing the top hat and aviator sunglasses goes, boisterous, blues-soaked rock’n’roll is never far behind.

Zelenskiy was in Bucha today alongside prime minister Denys Shmyhal and several foreign ambassadors to mark two years since the city and surrounding areas’ were liberated from a brutal month-long occupation by Russia at the start of the war. The Ukrainian leader laid a lamp at the town’s Wall of Remembrance, which names the 509 civilians who have so far been identified of those killed during Bucha’s occupation. Russia launched 16 missiles and 11 drones at Ukraine in an overnight air attack, Ukraine’s air force said. In a statement on Telegram, the air force said it had managed to down nine of the drones and nine of the missiles. It did not identify their targets. The Russian air force conducted a massive strike on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and gas industry overnight, the Russian defence ministry said. Thousands in Ukraine’s Odesa region were temporarily left without power after debris from a downed Russian drone caused a blaze at an energy facility. Ukraine launched ten Czech-made Vampire rockets at the Russian border region of Belgorod, according to Russia’s Ministry of Defence. And Ukrainian shelling killed a woman in the village of Dunayka, Belgorod Oblast, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. France will deliver hundreds of old armoured vehicles and new surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine in its war against Russia. French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu told a French newspaper that president Emmanuel Macron had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. Protesters in Kyiv are calling for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war from the notorious Azov brigade. Relatives and friends of captured soldiers, some dressed in military clothing, waved placards at passing traffic. The Azov brigade has often been criticised for its links with Nazism and the far-right. Russia launched a “counter-terrorism operation” regime in the southern region of Dagestan, detaining three people by Sunday morning. “Security agencies detained three bandits who were planning a number of terrorist offences. During the inspection of the places where the criminals were detained, automatic weapons, ammunition and an improvised explosive device ready for use were found,” Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said, according to Russian news agencies. AP provides some more detail on president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Bucha today. Zelenskiy was in Bucha alongside prime minister Denys Shmyhal and several foreign ambassadors, to commemorate the second anniversary of the area’s liberation from Russian forces. The Ukrainian leader laid a lamp at the town’s Wall of Remembrance, the president’s website said. The monument names the 509 civilians who have so far been identified of those killed during the occupation, which lasted just over a month. Bucha’s name has come to evoke savagery by Moscow’s military since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Ukrainian troops who retook the town two years ago today found the bodies of men, women and children on the streets, in gardens and homes, as well as buried in mass graves. Some bodies showed signs of torture. Ukrainian shelling killed a woman in the Russian border village of Dunayka, the latest in a series of deadly cross-border attacks by Kyiv, AFP reports, citing the local governor. “The village of Dunayka, in the Graivoron urban district, came under Ukrainian fire. To much grief, a civilian was killed,” governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media. “She died of her wounds on the spot before the ambulance crew arrived. I express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased,” he added. Dunayka, in Belgorod oblast, is about four miles from the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian forces launched over a dozen drone and artillery strikes at the region in the past 24 hours, Gladkov said. Russian authorities said yesterday they had evacuated five thousand children from the border territory following weeks of deadly strikes that killed over a dozen people. Protesters in Kyiv are calling for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war from the Azov brigade. Relatives and friends of captured soldiers, some dressed in military clothing, waved placards at passing traffic. At its inception in 2014, the Azov brigade included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, though some have suggest fits far-right links and symbolism have remained. Speaking to commemorate the liberation of Bucha, which took place two years ago today, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said of Ukraine’s war with Russia: “This is a war for our state’s right to exist, as well as for everyone’s right to life. This is a war for the dignity of our people and every nation seeking its own destiny”. Bucha was the scene of a savage occupation by Russian forces for just over a month at the start of the invasion. After Ukraine retook the city and surrounding areas, hundreds of bodies of civilians were found, some in mass graves. “The bodies of our people, which were found on the streets of Bucha, demonstrated that no one in the world can stay away from this battle,” Zelenskiy said. “Because it is here, in Ukraine, through the defense our people, our lives, and our state, that humanity is prevailing. “To unleash such aggressions against others, Russia first destroyed its own morality and turned violence and hatred into its ideology. Such systems do not simply stop. They are brought to a stop by force. Unity stops them. Determination and an understanding of what they want to destroy is what stops them. I thank everyone in the world who really helps us.” This is a war of global significance. This is a war for our state's right to exist, as well as for everyone's right to life. This is a war for the dignity of our people and every nation seeking its own destiny.

The Guardian was unable to independently verify Ukraine’s claims. Earlier this month, Ukraine released footage purporting to show the sinking of the patrol ship, the Sergei Katov. March was a bad month for the russian Black Sea Fleet. On March 5, Magura V5 naval drones attacked the patrol ship ""Sergei Kotov"".

More than 200 Russian tourists have visited the pariah state so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Pjotr Sauer reports on why Pyongyang is has opened its arms to Russian visitors. Gliding down pristine, untouched mountain runs, Olga Shpalok said she was “getting 100% satisfaction”. After a full day of skiing, the Russian designer from Vladivostok wound down with a visit to her hotel’s well-equipped spa and sauna. “They said it was very hard to get into the country. But fate smiled upon us,” she said. Shpalok was part of the first group of foreign tourists to visit North Korea since it shut down its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020. In early February, she travelled to the country with 100 other Russian tourists on a four-day skiing trip summed up by the Russian embassy as “Pyongyang opens its doors”. More than 200 Russian tourists have visited North Korea so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Their interviews and accounts give a rare insight into life in Kim Jong-un’s regime. Closely watched by government “minders”, who restricted what they could see and where they could go, the Russian tourists described spending time in otherwise empty luxurious ski resorts. Some said they felt deep unease over the poverty and total control they witnessed. Russia’s access to the pariah state is no coincidence. It comes at a time when the two countries have been moving closer at an unprecedented pace, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. North Korea has emerged as Russia’s largest supplier of weapons, shipping artillery shells, missiles and other equipment for Moscow’s continuing war. In exchange, Russia appears to be sending North Korea food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, bypassing international sanctions imposed on the country. The Russian tourist groups visiting North Korea illustrate another way Moscow can help Pyongyang. Before the pandemic, an estimated 5,000 westerners visited North Korea every year as part of pricey tours but since Covid-19 the borders have been sealed. Read the full piece here: A 19-year-old man was killed by Russian air attacks overnight in the Kharkiv region, according to local officials. The man was killed in the village of Borova, close to Izyum, Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram. It’s just gone 2.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s a roundup of today’s developments: Russia launched 16 missiles and 11 drones at Ukraine in an overnight air attack, Ukraine’s air force said on Sunday morning.

Pope Francis called for a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine in his Easter message: “In calling for respect for the principles of international law, I express my hope for a general exchange of all prisoners between Russia and Ukraine: all for the sake of all,” he said. France will deliver hundreds of old armoured vehicles and new surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine in its war against Russia. French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu told a French newspaper that president Emmanuel Macron had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. Russia launched a “counter-terrorism operation” regime in the southern region of Dagestan, detaining three people by Sunday morning. “Security agencies detained three bandits who were planning a number of terrorist offences. During the inspection of the places where the criminals were detained, automatic weapons, ammunition and an improvised explosive device ready for use were found,” Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said, according to Russian news agencies. Pope Francis led some 30,000 people in Easter celebrations, AP reports, appealing for a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, as well as a ceasefire in Gaza.“Peace is never made with weapons, but with outstretched hands and open hearts,” Francis said, to applause from the wind-swept crowd below.Francis said his thoughts went particularly to people in Ukraine and Gaza and all those facing war, particularly the children who he said had “forgotten how to smile.”“In calling for respect for the principles of international law, I express my hope for a general exchange of all prisoners between Russia and Ukraine: all for the sake of all,” he said. The Russian air force has conducted a massive strike on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and gas industry, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry said that it used “high-precision long-range air-based weapons” and drones, Reuters reports. “As a result of this strike, the operation of defence industry enterprises involved in the manufacture and repair of weapons, equipment and ammunition has been disrupted. All the goals of the strike have been achieved. The assigned objects were hit,” the ministry said. Earlier today Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 16 missiles and 11 drones in an overnight air attack. In a statement on Telegram, the air force said it had managed to down nine of the drones and nine of the missiles. France will deliver hundreds of old armoured vehicles and new surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine in its war against Russia, Reuters reports. In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche, a French Sunday newspaper launched last year, French defence minister Sebastien Lecornu said that president Emmanuel Macron had asked him to prepare a new aid package, which will include old but still functional equipment, as well as new missiles. “The Ukrainian army needs to defend a very long front line, which requires armoured vehicles; this is absolutely crucial for troop mobility and is part of the Ukrainian requests,” he said. He said France was looking at providing hundreds of VAB (Véhicule de l’Avant Blindé) front-line troop carriers in 2024 and early 2025.",2024-03-31

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,664,‘Luxury’ skiing in North Korea: the Russians allowed behind the border,"Gliding down pristine, untouched mountain runs, Olga Shpalok said she was “getting 100% satisfaction”. After a full day of skiing, the Russian designer from Vladivostok wound down with a visit to her hotel’s well-equipped spa and sauna. “They said it was very hard to get into the country. But fate smiled upon us,” she said. Shpalok was part of the first group of foreign tourists to visit North Korea since it shut down its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020. In early February, she travelled to the country with 100 other Russian tourists on a four-day skiing trip summed up by the Russian embassy as “Pyongyang opens its doors”. More than 200 Russian tourists have visited North Korea so far this year in total across three trips in February and March. Their interviews and accounts give a rare insight into life in Kim Jong-un’s regime. Closely watched by government “minders”, who restricted what they could see and where they could go, the Russian tourists described spending time in otherwise empty luxurious ski resorts. Some said they felt deep unease over the poverty and total control they witnessed. Russia’s access to the pariah state is no coincidence. It comes at a time when the two countries have been moving closer at an unprecedented pace, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. North Korea has emerged as Russia’s largest supplier of weapons, shipping artillery shells, missiles and other equipment for Moscow’s continuing war. In exchange, Russia appears to be sending North Korea food, raw materials and parts used in weapons manufacturing, bypassing international sanctions imposed on the country. The Russian tourist groups visiting North Korea illustrate another way Moscow can help Pyongyang. Before the pandemic, an estimated 5,000 westerners visited North Korea every year as part of pricey tours but since Covid-19 the borders have been sealed. Faced with increasingly tightening international sanctions and a reported food crisis triggered by the pandemic isolation, any hard currency is a welcome addition to Pyongyang’s cash-strapped coffers. “It’s a telling reflection of the regime’s priorities that North Korea has opted to allow Russian tourists access, yet continues to rebuff appeals from humanitarian organisations pleading for entry,” said Hanna Song, of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights in Seoul. The group tours, first announced in January by several Russian tourist agencies, cost $750 (£600). This includes the round-trip air fare to Pyongyang, North Korea’s sole international airport in the capital. Also covered were the domestic flight to the ski resort on North Korea’s eastern coast, the hotel stay, and meals. The $40 daily ski pass, souvenirs and other expenses, including alcohol and cigarettes, were paid out of pocket in cash. The tours begin with a two-hour flight from the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok to Pyongyang, operated by the North Korean state-owned Air Koryo airlines. It is made up of an ageing fleet of mostly Russian-made Tu-154 aircraft. “When I boarded the plane, I wondered if we were going to make it at all,” recalled Alexandra Daniyelko, a PR manager from Moscow who joined one of the tours. On arrival at Pyongyang, the Russian tourists visited central Kim Il-sung Square, bowed to the bronze statues of the late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il on Mansu Hill and attended a youth musical performance at the Mangyongdae Children’s Palace, where members of communist youth groups put on patriotic music and dance performance. These carefully staged shows are traditionally steeped in government propaganda aimed at instilling North Koreans with national pride and loyalty to Kim’s family, which has ruled ruthlessly since it came to power in 1948. “I cried at the purity, kindness and talent of these kids,” said Daniyelko, describing the performance. Another Russian tourist described the children as “perfectly disciplined and obedient”, adding that the local minders confiscated the chocolates that some Russian tourists brought for the children. But for many on the trip, the holiday truly kicked off on the second day, when the tourists boarded an internal flight to the coastal town of Wonsan near the Masikryong ski resort. The resort is one of the large-scale construction projects built at the behest of Kim in recent years, thought to have cost £24m. Guests are ferried to the slopes on old Austrian-made gondolas imported from China. Ahead of the resort’s opening in 2014, a ski-less Kim was photographed in a lift chair smoking a cigarette. The Russian tourists were told they would be staying at a “five-star Swiss Alps-style resort” which was built on the orders of Kim, himself educated in Switzerland. Images published on Instagram showed polished hotel rooms, a modern swimming pool, a sauna, a massage area and a hair salon. “There weren’t any people on the main slopes, which was just perfect,” said Yekaterina Kolomeetsa, a travel blogger from Vladivostok. Empty ski pistes are hardly surprising considering that there are reportedly just 5,500 skiers among a population of 24 million. Despite North Korea’s best efforts to present a highly curated image of their country, some Russian tourists said they left disturbed. “You could sense hopelessness and constant control in the country during the entire trip,” said Shpalok. In Pyongyang, as she rode on a bus with other tourists, she said she rarely saw any cars or people on the roads. “We asked our guides where everyone was. They told us people were happily at work.” The tourists were strictly forbidden from filming ordinary houses or people and couldn’t venture on walks alone. The few people Shpalok did see looked “short and hungry”, while some children were “barely dressed” despite the cold. Yulia Mishkova, another Russian tourist, said the trip was worth it for those “looking for a dose of absurdity”. “I just felt sorry for the frightened North Koreans,” Mishkova said, adding that it was hard to ignore the fact that her daily ski pass cost more than the average monthly salary. “I will not go again for moral and ethical reasons.” Still, both countries appear to have big plans for the future. According to a report by the government of Primorsky Krai, a region in Russia’s far east on the border of the two countries, North Korea is also building another mass ski resort for Russian tourists that will include 17 hotels, 37 guesthouses and 29 shops. Tatyana Markova, a representative of the Vostok Intur travel agency, said two hiking trips to North Korea have already been planned for the Russian holidays in May. “This is just the start,” said a recent advertisement promoting the May tours to North Korea. “Make sure you book your spot fast!”",2024-03-31 12:02:11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/31/luxury-skiing-in-north-korea-the-russians-allowed-behind-the-border,The Guardian,664,gliding pristine untouched mountain said getting 100 satisfaction full day skiing designer wound visit spa sauna said hard get country fate upon u said part first group foreign visit north korea since shut start pandemic 2020 early travelled country 100 skiing trip summed embassy 200 north korea far year total across three march give rare insight life kim regime closely watched government restricted could see could go spending time otherwise empty luxurious ski said felt deep unease poverty total control access pariah state coincidence come time two moving closer unprecedented pace triggered invasion north korea supplier shipping artillery equipment war exchange russia sending north korea food raw used international country tourist visiting north korea illustrate another way help pandemic 5000 north korea every year part since covid19 sealed faced increasingly international food crisis triggered pandemic isolation hard currency welcome addition telling reflection north korea allow access yet rebuff humanitarian pleading entry said hanna song center north human group first several tourist cost 750 £ 600 air fare north sole international airport capital also covered domestic flight ski resort north eastern coast hotel stay 40 daily ski pas alcohol pocket cash begin flight city north air made fleet mostly tu154 aircraft plane going make manager one arrival central kim square bowed bronze late kim kim hill youth musical performance palace communist youth put patriotic music dance performance carefully staged traditionally government propaganda north national pride loyalty family ruthlessly since came power 1948 cried purity kindness talent said performance another tourist perfectly obedient local brought many trip holiday truly second day internal flight coastal town near ski resort resort one construction built behest kim recent thought cost £ 24m old china ahead opening 2014 kim lift chair smoking cigarette told would swiss resort built kim educated polished hotel modern swimming pool sauna massage area hair salon werent people main perfect said travel empty ski hardly surprising considering reportedly 5500 among population 24 million despite north best present highly image country said left disturbed could sense hopelessness constant control country entire trip said rode bus said rarely saw people everyone told u people happily work strictly forbidden ordinary people venture alone people see short hungry barely dressed despite cold another tourist said trip worth looking dose absurdity felt sorry frightened north said hard ignore fact daily ski pas cost average monthly salary go moral ethical still appear big future according report government region far east border two north korea also building another mass ski resort include 17 37 29 representative travel agency said two north korea already may start said recent advertisement may north korea make sure book spot fast luxury skiing north korea behind border
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,665,‘My jaw dropped’: Annie Jacobsen on her scenario for nuclear war,"Annie Jacobsen was a high school student in 1983, when ABC television broadcast the film The Day After, about the horrors of nuclear war. She never forgot the experience. More than 100 million Americans watched and were terrified too. One of them lived in the White House. According to his biographer and his own memoirs, it helped turn Ronald Reagan into a nuclear disarmer in his second term. Not long after, the world’s stockpile of nuclear warheads peaked and began to decline rapidly, from 70,000 to just over 12,000 currently, according to the Federation of American Scientists. That is still enough however to reduce the Earth to a radioactive desert, with some warheads left over to make it glow. Meanwhile, the global situation is arguably the most dangerous since the Cuban missile crisis, the Russian invasion of Ukraine grinding on mercilessly and China contemplating following Moscow’s example by making a grab for Taiwan. The danger of nuclear war is as immediate as ever but it has faded from public discourse, which is why Jacobsen, now a journalist and author, felt driven to write her new book, Nuclear War: A Scenario. “For decades, people were under the assumption that the nuclear threat ended when the Berlin Wall went down,” Jacobsen said, before suggesting another reason the existential threat of nuclear weapons has been filtered out of mainstream discourse – it has been turned into a technical debate. “​​Nuclear weapons and the whole nomenclature around them have been so rarefied it’s been reserved as a subject for those in the know,” she said. In her book, Jacobsen seeks to break through jargon and details in order to tell a terrifying story in a devastatingly straightforward way. The spoiler alert is that it doesn’t end well. As the book promises on the cover, it presents a single scenario for a nuclear war, set in the present day. North Korea, perhaps convinced it is about to be attacked, launches a surprise missile strike against the US, leading Washington to respond with a salvo of 50 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These are aimed at North Korea’s weapons sites and command centres, but in order to reach their intended targets the missiles have to fly over Russia, because they do not have the range to use any other route. All too aware of the danger of miscalculation, the US president tries to get hold of his Russian counterpart. But the two men and the countries they run are not getting on, and he fails. Making things even worse, Russia’s dodgy satellite early warning system, Tundra, has exaggerated the scale of the US salvo, and from his Siberian bunker, the Russian president (Vladimir Putin in all but name) orders an all-out nuclear attack on the US. The scenario is based on known facts concerning the world’s nuclear arsenals, systems and doctrine. Those facts are all in the public domain, but Jacobsen believes society has tuned them out, despite (or perhaps because of) how shocking they are. Jacobsen was stunned to find out that an ICBM strike against North Korea would have to go over Russia, and that Russia’s early warning system is beset with glitches, an especially worrying fact when combined with the knowledge that both the US and Russia have part of their nuclear arsenals ready to launch at a few minutes’ notice. Both also have an option in their nuclear doctrine to “launch on warning”, without waiting for the first incoming warhead to land. A US president would have a few minutes to make a decision if American early warning systems signaled an incoming attack. In those few minutes, he or she would have to process an urgent, complex and inevitably incomplete stream of information and advice from top defence officials. Jacobsen points out that in such circumstances the president is likely to be subject to “jamming”, a chorus of military voices urging he or she follows protocols which lead inexorably towards a retaliatory launch. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “My jaw dropped at so much of what I learned, which was not classified but had just been removed or rather sanitised from the public discourse,” she said. “I found myself constantly surprised by the insanity of what I learned, coupled with the fact that it’s all there for the public to know.” Ultimately, only presidents can make the decision and once it is made, no one has the authority to block it. It is called sole authority, and it is almost certainly the most frightening fact in the world today. It means a handful of men each have the power to end the world in a few minutes, without having to consult anyone. It is not a group anyone would choose to have that responsibility, including as it does the likes of Putin and Kim Jong-un. In Washington it is a choice this year between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They all bring a lot of human frailty, anger, fear and paranoia to a potential decision that could end the planet. “You would want to have a commander-in-chief who is of sound mind, who is fully in control of his mental capacity, who is not volatile, who is not subject to anger,” Jacobsen said, referring to this year’s presidential election. “These are significant character qualities that should be thought about when people vote for president, for the simple reason that the president has sole authority to launch nuclear weapons.” Nuclear War: A Scenario is published in the US by Dutton Nuclear War is published in the UK by Transworld Publishers Ltd, £20.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,666,Israel alone? Allies’ fears grow over conduct – and legality – of war in Gaza,"When Gilad Erdan, the Israeli envoy to the UN, sat before the security council to rail against the ceasefire resolution it had just passed, he cut a lonelier figure than ever in the cavernous chamber. The US, Israel’s constant shield at the UN until this point, had declined to use its veto, allowing the council’s demand for an immediate truce – even though it contained, as Erdan furiously pointed out, no condemnation of the Hamas massacre of Israelis that had begun the war. That had been a red line for the US until Monday, as had making a ceasefire conditional on a release of hostages. But after nearly six months of constant bombing, with more than 32,000 dead in Gaza and a famine imminent, those red lines were allowed to fade, and the American ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, kept her hand still when the chair called for votes against the resolution. The message was clear: time was up on the Israeli offensive, and the Biden administration was no longer prepared to let the US’s credibility on the world stage bleed away by defending an Israeli government which paid little, if any, heed to its appeals to stop the bombing of civilian areas and open the gates to substantial food deliveries. “This must be a turning point,” the Palestinian envoy, Riyad Mansour, told the security council, mourning those who had died in the time it had taken its members to overcome their differences. For the next few days, there were other signs that the west was changing its position, at least in terms of its rhetoric. On Tuesday, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, announced that Berlin would be dispatching a delegation to remind Israel pointedly of its obligations under Geneva conventions, and warned the country not to proceed with a planned offensive on the city of Rafah, in the very south of Gaza. It was a notable change in tone from a country that has been Israel’s second biggest supporter and arms supplier. Meanwhile, in the UK, foreign secretary David Cameron has been ratcheting up his criticism of Israel – particularly over its blocking of aid into Gaza – while at the same time being ultra-careful to deflect questions as to whether the Foreign Office now believes Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has been breaching international humanitarian law. Trying to strike that balance has created real and increasingly obvious strains within the British government, and the Tory party. This definite shifting of international positions has, however, changed nothing as yet for the 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza. The bombing and sniping have not stopped. The politicians may be recalibrating, but not fast enough for those in the line of fire. In the 48 hours after the security council applauded itself for passing the ceasefire resolution, 157 ­people in Gaza were killed. Eighteen of them, including at least nine children and five women, died when a house full of displaced people was bombed in northern Rafah. Twelve people drowned trying to reach airdropped food parcels that had fallen into the sea. The number of trucks crossing into Gaza rose slightly to about 190 a day – less than half the peacetime daily total. Israeli inspectors were still turning back 20 to 25 each day, NBC News reported, citing an Egyptian aid official, on grounds as arbitrary as the wooden pallets bearing the food not being exactly the right dimensions. Israel has banned Unrwa, the main UN relief agency in the region, from using the crossing. A US state department official told Reuters on Friday that famine had already taken hold in some parts of Gaza, echoing a similar finding last week by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Four days on from the passing of the security council resolution, more US arms deliveries were being reported by the Washington Post, including 1,800 MK84 2,000lb bombs – massive munitions that are implicated in numerous mass ­casualty events over the course of the Gaza war. Furthermore, despite the UN vote just days before, the Biden administration has made it clear to its allies that threatening to stop weapons supplies to Israel as leverage is off the table, at least for now. The president told a fundraising event on Thursday: “You can’t forget that Israel is in a position where its very existence is at stake.” In the UK, however, there is a growing sense that the legal issues, and related questions about arms sales, cannot be avoided, or fudged, for much longer. As the Observer reports this weekend, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Alicia Kearns – a former employee of the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence – told a Tory fundraising event in north London on 13 March that Cameron’s department has been given legal advice that Israel has broken international humanitarian law, but has chosen not to make it public. That claim will send shudders through London and Washington, as it strikes at the heart of one of the most sensitive issues in international diplomacy. In January, appearing before Kearns’s committee, Cameron dodged questions on the issue of whether he had seen such legal advice, saying “I cannot recall every single piece of paper that has been put in front of me … I don’t want to answer that question.” Even then, in that same hearing – and before he became as vocal as he is now – he did concede that he was “worried” that Israel might have been in breach. It is not difficult to understand why the Foreign Office and Cameron may be being opaque. The existence of such advice, and any open acknowledgment of it, would trigger a series of requirements on ministers, not the least of which would be the duty to halt all British arms sales to Israel. Indeed, even if the legal advice suggested there was a “risk” of Israel having been in breach, it would have to stop exports. Some say the UK would even have to cease sharing intelligence with the US because the US might hand it on to Israel. In a recent letter to Cameron, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, homed in on this same point about arms exports, referring to criterion 2c of the UK’s Strategic Export Licensing Criteria, which requires the government to “not grant a licence if it determines there is a clear risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law”. Criterion 2c adds that “the government will also take account of the risk that the items might be used to commit or facilitate gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women or children”. Lammy said that this was “particularly relevant, given that women and children constitute a majority of the victims of the war in Gaza”. Many Tory MPs are worried that Cameron might be about to announce an embargo on the sale of arms to Israel. At a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers on Monday, the foreign secretary denied he was thinking anything of the sort, although Foreign Office officials say it cannot be out of the question if Israel carries out its threat to attack Rafah. Just as in the US, the UK’s tone may be shifting to one that is more critical of Israel. But creating the political space to match this with openness about the legal advice being given, and then taking ­consequent action, will prove far more difficult. For its part, Israel has been roundly criticised, but it is still far from a pariah. Netanyahu and his war cabinet continue to insist that Israel will press ahead with an offensive on Rafah, where more than a million displaced civilians have taken shelter, shrugging off US warnings that it would be a “mistake” which would backfire on Israeli security. Two Israeli ministers are due in Washington to discuss the planned offensive in the coming week, on a visit which Netanyahu had initially cancelled in protest at the Biden administration’s abstention at the security council. American officials say they will use the meetings to present an alternative blueprint for counter-insurgency against Hamas in Rafah, focusing on precision raids on senior Hamas figures, but they admit they have no way to oblige their visitors to take the suggestions seriously. “They are a sovereign state. We will not interfere with their military planning, but we will outline in general terms what we think is another way to go to better achieve the same aims,” a US official said. In further apparent defiance of Washington’s views, the Israeli military are carving out a buffer zone around Gaza’s borders which would take up 16% of the whole coastal strip, according to Haaretz. Israeli public opinion has to date shown itself largely impervious to US and other international pressure, and support for the Gaza war currently hovers at around 80%. Even more concerning for Washington’s hopes of containing the conflict, there is also more than 70% Israeli public support for a large-scale military operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon – something Washington has so far managed to forestall. In Israel itself, pro-war demonstrators are far more in evidence than anti-war ones. Israeli settlers and rightwing activists have focused their protests on Unrwa over the past week, blocking the entrances to its Jerusalem office. The protesters portrayed the UN ceasefire resolution as an attack against Israel. “If you look at the number of UN condemnations against Israel versus the number of condemnations against North Korea or Syria, you can see how they are obsessed with us, and this is another proof of their obsession,” said Roei Ben Dor, a 21-year-old from the central Israeli town of Gedera. “We should be in Gaza, not just because of Hamas but because Gaza is ours. We have every right to take Gaza, to take Rafah. This is our land.” Aynat Libman, a 52-year-old Israeli settler from Efrat, argued the resolution simply proved the UN’s inherent antisemitism. “How could the UN possibly say we should stop the war before we are done protecting ourselves?” Libman said. “We can do this on our own. But, of course, it would be nice if we had the support.’’ The absence of bite in the international community’s reprimands has emboldened the current Israeli coalition’s sense of immunity from global public opinion, but the onset of full-scale famine, or an offensive on Rafah, could bring a much sharper response from Israel’s friends and adversaries. And there are signs that the real damage done to Israel’s global standing could worsen over time, with possibly far-reaching consequences. Michael Sfard, an Israeli Human Rights lawyer and expert in international humanitarian law says the “international community has miserably failed to prevent the deterioration of the Israeli Palestinian conflict to the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza today’’. He added: “The security council resolution is an important step in the right direction. The question is whether the parties to the conflict will be held accountable if they fail to abide to it.’’ As in the UK, tension in the US is building around the question of international law. Last week, a state department human rights official resigned, saying that the government was flouting domestic legislation prohibiting military assistance to any foreign army units implicated in atrocities, or to any country which impedes “the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance”. The official, Annelle Sheline, said the state department had evidence of violations, but it was being suppressed. “I think some of these internal processes are not going to become public until the White House is willing for them to come out,” Sheline said. The state department has said in the past week that its review process had so far provided no reason to doubt that formal Israeli assurances that it is complying with international humanitarian law, as required under US statute, are “credible and reliable”. But a full report on those assurances is not due until 8 May, which could become a point of leverage on Israel if there is no breakthrough in the provision of food relief to Gaza. “That is what you have to look for,” said Aaron David Miller, a former state department negotiator now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But Miller added: “I would be stunned if the administration made a judgment that the Israelis are out of compliance.” But the other potential shift with long-term ramifications for Israel’s future is the changing attitudes of young Americans, many of whom have jettisoned the pro-Israel reflexes of their parents, and have made Gaza an issue with protest votes in the Democratic presidential primary. A recent Gallup poll found 63% of Americans aged 18-34 disapproved of Israeli military action, as did 55% overall of those questioned. “We are witnessing an unprecedented moment of collective awareness about the ongoing occupation and apartheid conditions in Israel-Palestine,” said Rae Abileah, a progressive US Jewish activist. “I have never seen this level of people consistently taking to the streets. For years, you could say: ‘You can be progressive except on Palestine.’ We can’t say that any more.” She added: “The writing is more on the wall than it’s ever been.”",2024-03-31

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,667,"Le Crookie: after the cronut and the cruffin, latest croissant hybrid takes Paris by storm","It was 3 February when the queues started forming at Boulangerie Louvard in Paris. Even in the sort of downpour that usually empties streets, clued-up teenagers gathered outside the family-run bakery in the 9th arrondissement, desperate to get their hands on one thing: its owner Stéphane Louvard’s invention, le crookie. It’s a crisp croissant filled with American-style cookie dough, then baked to achieve a soft, gooey centre, and a video of the Frankensteined pastry had gone viral on TikTok. Arriving a decade after the New York-based French pastry chef Dominique Ansel revealed the recipe for his cronut, the crookie is the latest in a long line of hybrid croissant offerings to cause international fervour. “We were very surprised,” says Louvard, who now sells up to 2,200 crookies per day. “We had to hire two additional people to be able to produce the necessary quantities. It was a little stressful.” Bakeries across Paris have now started selling them. “My local is doing it, even though it’s not very trendy at all,” says Houssine Bouchama, director of Time Out Paris. Meanwhile, from Singapore to Toronto, copycats are making their own versions. Cookie Crumble, a micro-bakery in London, has been getting orders from across the country. Rhiain Gordon, founder of Babyfaced Baker in Edinburgh tells me it’s “unusual to see any left by 10am”. To say that cross-bred takes on classic breakfast pastries have captured public imagination is an understatement. In 2013, when Ansel first brought the cronut, with its glazed doughnut outside and flaky pastry inside, to New York, they sold out so quickly that a black market arose on advertising website Craigslist. By the time it landed in the UK in 2016, it was with so much fanfare that Londoners skipped work to try it. A muffin-croissant hybrid, the cruffin, was next, causing such a stir at Mr. Holmes Bakehouse in San Francisco that in 2015 the recipe was reportedly stolen. Then came the croloaf (croissant dough baked in a bread tin, debuted by M&S in 2016). There have been tacros (pulled pork filled taco-shaped croissants created by San Francisco’s Vive La Tarte) and cretzels (salted pretzels made with croissant dough, by Seattle’s Coyle’s Bakeshop). Since the global launch of TikTok in 2017, the appetite for these hybrid snacks has accelerated. In 2022, the suprême – a spiral of croissant dough stuffed with the pastry creme-filling of an Italian bomboloni doughnut – became a global sensation. Next came the croffle; croissant dough pressed in a waffle machine, popularised in South Korea by cafe chain Aufglet. What is it about hybrid croissants that have captured global public imagination for so long? Meg Palmer, a research manager at market research agency Verve, thinks it’s because “there’s something about the merging that makes it more permissible to be indulgent”. Pastries are also perfect for TikTok, she explains, because they look and sound great. “[In videos of] the crookie you see hands breaking through the croissant. You hear that initial crunch, and you see whether it’s got filling if it oozes out. It’s very sensorial.” She ties the constant invention of hybrids to small businesses trying to stand out on social media. “They’re always thinking ‘what can be our hook?’ People do latch on to these trends, and they don’t just want a flat white and a croissant any more.” Bouchama has seen the impact of this in Paris. “There’s an Americanisation of French patisserie going on; the desire to reach an international audience on TikTok,” he says. Bakery Philippe Conticini in Islington is London’s main purveyor of novelty croissants. The chain launched in London in 2020 with classic French patisserie, but found it hard to survive. “We’ve found we have to be creative all the time and follow the trends,” says Ludovic Carassi Del Villar, operations manager. The shop soft-launched its £5.90 crookie last week and is already getting calls demanding more. Back in Paris, TikTokers are already moving on, says Bouchama: “Some bakeries are now experimenting with the pain au chocolat-brownie.”",2024-03-30 15:00:11,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/mar/30/le-crookie-after-the-cronut-and-the-cruffin-latest-croissant-hybrid-takes-paris-by-storm,The Guardian,667,3 forming even sort downpour usually street outside bakery 9th desperate get one thing owner invention crisp filled dough baked achieve soft video pastry gone viral decade new pastry chef revealed recipe latest long line hybrid cause international 2200 per day hire two additional people able produce necessary little stressful across selling local even though director time meanwhile making crumble getting across country founder baker unusual see left 10am say crossbred classic breakfast public imagination understatement 2013 first brought glazed doughnut outside flaky pastry inside new york sold quickly black market arose advertising time landed 2016 much fanfare work try hybrid next causing stir bakehouse san 2015 recipe reportedly stolen came dough baked bread tin 2016 pork filled san vive la salted made dough bakeshop since global launch 2017 appetite hybrid accelerated 2022 spiral dough stuffed pastry doughnut global sensation next came dough waffle machine south korea chain hybrid global public imagination long palmer research manager market research agency verve there something permissible indulgent also perfect look sound great see breaking hear initial crunch see whether got filling sensorial constant invention small trying stand social medium theyre always thinking hook people latch dont want flat white seen impact there patisserie going desire reach international audience bakery main purveyor novelty chain 2020 classic patisserie found hard survive weve found creative time follow villar manager shop £ 590 last week already getting demanding back already moving pain latest hybrid storm
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,668,"‘I’m just having fun’: Mohammed Kudus on goals, Ghana and his celebrations","Some defenders bounce off Mohammed Kudus and most end up bewitched by his footwork. West Ham’s Ghanaian sensation is an intriguing mix of strength, skill and imagination. His technique makes him one of the most dangerous players in the Premier League but Kudus believes his steely edge owes much to his upbringing in Nima, a place that teaches you to stand up for yourself from an early age. “Mentally it’s a very tough area,” he says. “You have to be very tough to live there. If you are soft people walk on you. It has an impact on how I play. In 50-50 challenges I don’t want to lose it. I work on my body and make sure I am very strong on the ball.” Kudus, who has been outstanding since joining West Ham last summer, laughs when he remembers the football back home. “There are no rules over there!” he says. “It’s all in. You have to be very strong.” Nima, a market town in the greater Accra region of Ghana, has a difficult reputation. “When you say Nima it’s like there’s a lot of violence happening there, it’s like a ghetto and you need to be street smart and tough to stay there,” Kudus says. He is out to change perceptions. “There’s a lot of professional players from there,” the 23-year-old adds. “It’s why I always keep mentioning where I come from. There can be talent as well.” Kudus is a role model. He loves connecting with his roots but it is no longer possible for him to live his old life when he visits home. He is too famous to do normal stuff – “like going by the roadside to get some food” – but his heart is there. A mural of Kudus went up in Nima after he scored in Ghana’s win over South Korea in the 2022 World Cup; he does not feel weighed down by being a champion to so many. “It’s my responsibility to share my story and represent where I’m from,” he says. “I don’t feel it’s a burden. It’s a responsibility that comes with the position that God has put me into. I’m just trying to put more light on to this area, get more scouts there and engage more young footballers there.” Kudus, whose footballing journey began when he joined Strong Tower FC at the age of 10, wants to give back. “Any time I’m in Ghana I visit my old club,” he says. “I have my project with Puma. We had a partnership where I got kits and boots at the end of every season and take it back to my home town. When I was growing up not all the guys had football boots and they couldn’t play. Some played in bare feet. I try to help.” Kudus is funny, smart and confident, but he is humble. He thinks about his family – his mother, Mariam, his brothers, Rahman and Fatawu, and his sister, Miyuna. He remembers being away from them after joining Ghana’s Right to Dream academy. “It comes down to sacrifices,” Kudus says. “I moved to the academy when I was 11 or 12, and I had to stay far away from home. Sometimes I’d go home just two times a year. “It was very difficult not to see my family. I remember sometimes wanting to go back home. As time went on I realised everything I was doing was for them. It would definitely have an impact on their lives. That kept me going.” The hard work was worth it. Kudus moved to the Danish club Nordsjaelland in 2018. “Very cold,” he says of Denmark. “But there was no turning back. “I was there for two seasons and in my first season I wasn’t playing much. I needed time to get used to everything. I played a little bit at the end of the season and the following season I was really settled. I needed time to get used to the culture, the weather. It was snowing, your boots are freezing, you don’t even feel it when you touch the ball.” Kudus used the ball well enough to earn a move to Ajax in 2020. He impressed in the Netherlands, grabbing attention when he scored at Anfield when Ajax faced Liverpool in the Champions League last season. Arsenal, Brighton and Chelsea looked at Kudus but West Ham made the strongest pitch. Tim Steidten, the club’s technical director, got a £37m deal over the line. “I was ready to make that step after the season I had at Ajax,” Kudus says. “I’m a player who doesn’t want to be in my comfort zone. I could have stayed at Ajax. I knew the league, I knew the club. But I don’t want to be complacent and comfortable. I always want to challenge myself. “All the clubs you mentioned, it’s true they were in contact. But when West Ham came it moved fast and I made my decision based on speaking to people around the club, their project and how they see me as a player. “I made the decision based on my gut feeling. That’s how I make my decisions. Whatever the ramifications are, I take it upon myself.” Kudus’s hunch looks good so far. David Moyes bedded him in slowly, waiting until October to give the Ghana international his first start, but there was no holding Kudus back once he was in the team. He scored his 13th goals in all competitions in West Ham’s visit to Newcastle on Saturday. “At Ajax, it was one of the biggest clubs in the league and if you went in 60%, 70% you were still going to win,” Kudus says. “But here even the small teams can surprise. You can’t switch off. I love it, it keeps me on my toes and I want it that way.” Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Kudus calls Luke Shaw, the Manchester United defender, his toughest opponent. He thinks about scoring a stunning overhead kick against Brentford in November. “Stuff like that is just instinct, you know,” he says. “It’s in two or three seconds. When the ball was coming – ‘Bicycle kick – yeah!’ It’s beautiful when it works.” Was it better than running from his own half and scoring a solo goal when West Ham thumped Freiburg in the last 16 of the Europa League last month? “No, no … I watched Messi do that a lot so, doing it one time, it’s in my books! When I took the ball I didn’t think I was going all the way to goal. But it was getting closer and closer and after the last defender I was thinking: ‘Yeah, I have to score this’. If I didn’t score that … nah. I’m glad I calmly finished it off.” At this stage it is worth pointing out that Kudus is not a luxury player. Moyes loves his workrate. Kudus understands the game. His favourite position is midfield but he has mostly played as a winger for West Ham. He says being wide makes him unpredictable. He has linked brilliantly with Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paquetá. “He is like the magnet between the back and the forwards,” Kudus says of Paquetá. “When he is on I know I can run and the ball will come.” Kudus is thinking big. West Ham are seventh in the league and face Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League quarter-finals next month. “We’re challenging for Europe in the league and we’re going for the cup,” Kudus says. He is ready for the run-in. He was low after Ghana’s early exit in the African Cup of Nations and he was not at his best after returning to West Ham. “As human beings we need some time to shake stuff off,” Kudus says. “I was injured before Afcon and had to put all my effort into being there to help the team. It was my first Afcon and it didn’t go as planned. When you go back straight into playing nobody ever gives you time to change gear. It had an impact because it was a big disappointment.” Kudus is revving up again, although he likes to slow down when he scores a goal. His trademark celebration is to sit on the advertising hoardings and wait for his teammates to mob him. “I just thought about something out of the box and then some other people followed it up,” Kudus says. “Now there’s a conversation about whose is better. I’ll have to come up with another juice and put more spices in the tin. It’s all about resting after scoring a goal. “There’s no deeper meaning. I just see it as entertainment, something to make people happy and worth the ticket that they bought. I’m still just having fun in the playground.” Did he notice Manchester United players copying him when West Ham lost at Old Trafford in January? “They’re allowed to do it,” Kudus says. “But soon they will have to start paying taxes.”",2024-03-29 20:00:49,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/29/west-ham-mohammed-kudus-on-goals-ghana-and-his-celebrations,The Guardian,668,bounce end footwork west sensation intriguing mix strength skill imagination technique one dangerous premier league steely edge much place stand early age mentally tough area tough live soft people walk impact play 5050 dont want lose work body make sure strong ball outstanding since joining west ham last summer football back home strong market town greater region difficult reputation say like there lot violence happening like ghetto need street smart tough stay change there lot professional 23yearold always keep come talent well role model longer possible live old life home famous normal stuff like going roadside get food heart mural went scored win south korea 2022 world cup feel weighed champion many responsibility share story represent dont feel burden responsibility come position god put trying put light area get engage young whose journey strong tower age 10 give back time visit old club project puma partnership got boot end every season take back home town growing football boot play bare try help funny smart confident humble family mother sister away joining right dream academy come academy 11 12 stay far away home sometimes id go home two time year difficult see family remember sometimes wanting go back home time went everything would definitely impact kept going hard work worth club 2018 cold turning back two first season wasnt much time get used everything little bit end season following season really settled time get used culture weather boot freezing dont even feel touch ball used ball well enough earn move 2020 attention scored faced league last season arsenal west ham made pitch technical director got £ 37m deal line ready make step season player doesnt want comfort zone could stayed knew league knew club dont want complacent comfortable always want challenge true contact west ham came fast made decision based speaking people around club project see player made decision based gut feeling thats make whatever take upon hunch good far bedded slowly waiting give international first start holding back team scored 13th west visit one biggest league went 60 70 still going win even small surprise cant switch love want way sign football daily kick take world football newsletter promotion luke shaw united defender opponent scoring stunning overhead kick stuff like instinct know two three ball coming bicycle kick yeah beautiful work better running half scoring solo goal west ham last 16 league last month … watched lot one time took ball didnt think going way goal getting closer closer last defender thinking yeah score didnt score … glad calmly finished stage worth pointing luxury player game position mostly winger west ham wide unpredictable linked brilliantly like magnet back forward know run ball come thinking big west ham seventh league face league next month league going cup ready low early exit cup best west ham human need time shake stuff injured put effort help team first didnt go go back straight nobody ever time change gear impact big disappointment although slow goal celebration sit advertising wait mob thought something box people there conversation whose better ill come another juice put tin resting scoring goal there meaning see entertainment something make people happy worth ticket bought still fun playground notice united west ham lost old theyre soon start paying fun

Russia has been striking targets in western and central Ukraine with missile and drone attacks conducted at night. “In the evening of 28 March 2024, fragments that seem to come from an aerial device (drone) were identified on an agricultural land in Insula Mare a Brailei,” Romania’s defence ministry said in a statement. “The Ministry of National Defence, together with specialized structures within the National Defence System, public order and national security, is conducting an investigation of the incident.” Nato has a mutual defence commitment if one of its members comes under attack, but the Atlantic alliance and Romanian officials have said following similar such incidents in the past that they have found no evidence of any deliberate attack targeting Romania. Russia is outgunning Ukrainian forces sixfold on the front lines, causing losses of troops and positions, Ukraine’s recently appointed commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a rare interview published on Friday. Ukraine has received a $1.5 billion (£1.19 billion) tranche of funding under a World Bank programme, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday, helping it pay for its budget and social spending as it defends itself against the Russian invasion. Nato member Romania said it had found fragments of what appeared to be a drone on a farm near the river Danube and the border with Ukraine late on Thursday. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said in a statement that energy facilities in six Ukrainian regions had been attacked in Russian missile and drone attacks. Ukraine’s foreign minister concluded his visit to New Delhi on Friday after talks on bolstering trade and the war with Russia, India’s traditional ally. India has shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, even as it has pursued greater security ties with the United States. But Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar said on social media that talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba had “reiterated our commitment to strengthen the overall relationship with Kyiv”. “Our immediate goal is to get trade back to earlier levels,” he added. Russian prosecutors have asked the justice ministry to consider labelling Alla Pugacheva, the queen of Soviet pop music, as a “foreign agent”, a move that would officially designate Russia’s most famous star a foe of the Kremlin. Pugacheva, known across generations for hits such as the 1982 song “Million Scarlet Roses” and the 1978 film “The Woman who Sings”, has expressed disgust with the Ukraine war. In 2022, she said the war was killing soldiers for illusory aims, burdening ordinary people and turning Russia into a pariah. Earlier this month, the 74-year-old said that no normal person would return to Russia. She is currently abroad. Vitaly Borodin, an activist who heads an anti-corruption group and who regularly appears on state television, submitted an official request to recognise Pugacheva as a foreign agent. Then Borodin published a letter from the prosecutor general’s office showing that a request had been made to the justice ministry to consider that. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had heard no official statements about the issue. Pugacheva, thought to be in Cyprus, did not immediately comment. Russia is outgunning Ukrainian forces sixfold on the front lines, causing losses of troops and positions, Ukraine’s recently appointed commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a rare interview published on Friday. “A few days ago, the enemy’s advantage in terms of ammunition fired was about six to one,” Syrsky told the Ukrinform news agency. “The defence forces are now performing tasks along the entire vast front line, with little or no weapons and ammunition,” he warned, saying the situation was “tense” in some areas. Syrsky took over as commander-in-chief in February after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his popular predecessor, Valery Zaluzhny. The European Parliament came under pressure on Friday to investigate a Russia-financed network that wielded influence across Europe and involved EU lawmakers. The Czech Republic said on Wednesday its spies discovered the network had been spreading Russian propaganda through the Prague-based Voice of Europe news site. The Greens said there needed to be a “swift and thorough” investigation. “This is how (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is trying to get away with his war in Ukraine.... It’s a direct attack on the very fabric of our democracy,” said Terry Reintke, one of the lead candidates for the Greens in the European elections in June. “The politicians who have received money from Russia should be severely punished, both politically and legally,” she added in a statement. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine’s Kaniv and Dnister hydropower plants had been attacked in overnight Russian strikes. “The terrorist country wants to repeat the environmental disaster in the Kherson region. But now not only Ukraine, but also Moldova is under threat,” Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app. One person was killed and two were injured in the Russian city of Belgorod as a result of a Ukrainian drone attack, Belgorod Region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Friday. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said he held “sincere” talks with his counterpart in India and “agreed to restore the level of cooperation between our countries that existed prior to the full-scale war launched by Russia.” In New Delhi, I had sincere and comprehensive talks with @DrSJaishankar about Ukrainian-Indian bilateral relations, the situation in our regions, and global security.

Ukraine has received a $1.5 billion tranche of funding under a World Bank programme, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday, helping it pay for its budget and social spending as it defends itself against the Russian invasion. Ukraine is reliant on financial aid from its Western partners but foreign financing dwindled in the first two months of this year, and a U.S. aid package has been blocked by Republicans in Congress for months. The new block of World Bank aid was funded by Britain and Japan, Shmyhal said. “984 million dollars come from Japan and 516 million dollars from the UK. The funds will cover budget spending for social and humanitarian needs and reconstruction,” he wrote on X. Ukraine has received 1.5 billion dollars from @WorldBank as part of the Development Policy Loan (DPL). 984 million dollars come from Japan and 516 million dollars from the UK.

We are… Russia said on Friday that major powers needed a new approach to North Korea, accusing the United States and its allies of ratcheting up military tensions in Asia and seeking to “strangle” the reclusive state. Since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has gone out of its way to parade a renaissance of its relationship - including military ties - with Pyongyang. Washington says North Korea has supplied Russia with missiles that it is using against Ukraine, assertions which have been dismissed by the Kremlin and Pygonyang. For Putin, who says Russia is locked in an existential battle with the west over Ukraine, courting Kim allows him to needle Washington and its Asian allies while securing a deep supply of artillery for the Ukraine war. Ukraine claims to have shot down 84 aerial targets during the Russian drone and missile offensive. The defence Ministry of Ukraine said it had shot down 58 Shahed UAVs, 17 Kh-101 cruise missiles, five Kh-59 guided air missiles and four Iskander-K cruise missiles.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in December that his military had proposed mobilising up to 500,000 more Ukrainians into the armed forces as Russia stepped up attacks along the 1,000-km (621-mile) front line. Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, who was appointed last month, said in an interview with Ukrainian media published on Friday that the figure had been “significantly reduced” after a review of resources. He did not name a new figure. “We expect that we will have enough people capable of defending their motherland,” he told the Ukrinform news agency. “I am talking not only about the mobilized but also about volunteer fighters.” Despite the war, the Ukrainian government continues to spend money on the Vernadsky base, an Antarctic research station. Some Ukrainians believe government funds would be better spent on the war in Ukraine. But its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appreciates that the Vernadsky base reminds the world that Ukraine is a global player in science, which contributes to our understanding of the climate crisis, and not just a victim of Russia’s invasion. Read more about those working on the base: Nato member Romania said it had found fragments of what appeared to be a drone on a farm near the river Danube and the border with Ukraine late on Thursday. Russia has been striking targets in western and central Ukraine with missile and drone attacks conducted at night. “In the evening of 28 March 2024, fragments that seem to come from an aerial device (drone) were identified on an agricultural land in Insula Mare a Brailei,” Romania’s defence ministry said in a statement. “The Ministry of National Defence, together with specialized structures within the National Defence System, public order and national security, is conducting an investigation of the incident.” Nato has a mutual defence commitment if one of its members comes under attack, but the Atlantic alliance and Romanian officials have said following similar such incidents in the past that they have found no evidence of any deliberate attack targeting Romania. Romanian authorities found fragments of what appeared to be a drone on a farm near the river Danube and border with Ukraine on Thursday evening, the defence ministry said in a statement. Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said in a statement that energy facilities in six Ukrainian regions had been attacked in Russian missile and drone attacks. The barrage hit thermal and hydro power plants in central and western Ukraine, power grid operator Ukrenergo said on Friday. Shmyhal said Ukraine needs more air defence systems to secure critical infrastructure and protect the population. Ukrainian state-run Naftogaz oil and gas firm also said its facilities had come under attack on Friday morning. “(Russian attacks) targeted Naftogaz Group’s facilities, but there was no serious damage,” it said in a statement, giving no more details. Russian missile and drone attacks overnight damaged Ukrainian thermal and hydro power plants, electricity grid operator Ukrenergo said on Friday. There were emergency shutdowns in the south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region. The Dnipropetrovsk governor, Serhii Lysak, said “critical infrastructure” was bombed and a man taken to hospital. Explosions were heard in Ukraine’s Ivano-Frankivsk and Khmelnytskyi regions and the city of Dnipro after Russian cruise missiles were spotted, national media outlet Suspilne reported. Poland scrambled planes as Ukraine came under missile attack on Friday morning, the Polish defence force said. The operational command said Polish and allied aircraft were activated due to “intense activity of long-range aviation of the Russian Federation” related to missile strikes against targets in Ukraine. A Russian SU-35 Flanker fighter jet has crashed into the sea off Sevastopol, Crimea. Footage online showed a jet on fire, spiralling into the ocean and exploding. The Russian-installed governor of the illegally occupied region, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Thursday the pilot ejected and was picked up by rescuers but gave no details as to the cause of the crash. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, told the speaker of the US House of Representatives during a phone call on Thursday that it was vital for Congress to pass a new military aid package for Ukraine. Mike Johnson, the speaker, has held up a bill for months that would supply $60bn in military and financial aid.“We recognise that there are differing views in the House of Representatives on how to proceed, but the key is to keep the issue of aid to Ukraine as a unifying factor,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said he briefed Johnson about the situation on the battlefield and also spoke about “the dramatic increase in Russia’s air terror”. The Ukrainian military later said that its top commander, Oleksander Syrskyi, spoke to the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Charles Brown, about battlefield issues. Zelenskiy, in a CBS interview, has warned that Vladimir Putin will push Russia’s war “very quickly” on to Nato soil unless he is stopped in Ukraine. Zelenskiy acknowledged that his troops are not prepared to defend against another imminent major Russian offensive, and highlighted the urgency for American Patriot missile defence systems and more artillery. The US is telling American companies making and selling parts that can be used in missiles and drones to stop shipping their goods to more than 600 foreign parties who might divert them to Russia. The parts have been found in Russian munitions recovered in Ukraine. A Russian court on Thursday sentenced journalist Mikhail Feldman to two years in prison for denouncing Moscow’s full-scale military offensive on Ukraine. Against the backdrop of war in Ukraine, several central and eastern European countries began marking on Thursday the 20th anniversary of the largest expansion of Nato when formerly socialist countries

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,671,A nimble New York grocery store follows Latino immigration to the south,"Iván Almonte has been in the US for almost 25 years years, but he still takes photos of the perfect produce – bouquets of epazote, mountains of chiles and perfectly ripe tunas from the prickly pear cactus – in his favorite Durham, North Carolina, grocery store. The 45-year-old remembers when those items were hard to find in this bustling New South city, when he first arrived in 1999 from California after emigrating from Michoacán, Mexico. “It used to be such a challenge when I first came to North Carolina,” Almonte said. “Every Friday or Saturday, we would have to drive 30 or 40 minutes to a carnicería in Burlington or Greensboro to get our ingredients. This went on for maybe 10 or 15 years before we started to see grocery stores that serve our communities. Compare Foods changed everything for us.” He was referring to the grocery store that serves as a community hub for many newly arrived immigrants to the US south. The expansion of this New York City-based chain into smaller markets across the region signals the changing demographics of the south-east, which once had relatively low numbers of foreign-born residents. But that started changing in the 1990s, when North Carolina, specifically, led the nation in the growth of its Latino population; between the 1990 and 2000 censuses, that demographic jumped almost 400%. And according to Census Bureau projections, more than one in four Americans will be Latino by 2060, with Latino buying power having tripled. This shift – in which many immigrants were recruited by agricultural operations or otherwise left traditional destinations in the west and south-west for other points in the sun belt – inspired Compare Foods and its parent company, Aurora Grocery Group, to similarly relocate southward from New York. A family business, Compare Foods started after Eligio Peña came to New York City from the Dominican Republic in 1970. A bodega job eventually led him to purchase his own corner store with his brothers, effectively serving as the family’s entry point into the business. In 1989, Eligio’s brother, Manuel, opened the first Compare Foods in Freeport, New York. The chain now has dozens of locations across the east coast and the south-east, many of which are run by family members – descendants of Eligio, Manuel and their 13 siblings who also helped launch the business. North Carolina’s first Compare Foods opened in Zebulon, a small town outside Raleigh, in 2003. In the years since, the state has become central to the grocery store’s operations. Omar Jorge Peña, the CEO of Aurora Grocery Group’s Compare Foods business in North Carolina, said there were multiple reasons for the company’s moves in the south. First, the surging Latino population ensured a large pool of potential customers. Then, the departure of grocery retailers like Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo opened up available real-estate locations. And North Carolina particularly is in a prime location, close to priority future markets as the company plans to expand “northwards towards Washington DC, southwards towards Atlanta, or westward towards Nashville”. That it’s taken a few decades for a grocery chain like Compare Foods to find its foothold in the south isn’t entirely a surprise. In her book Making the Latino South: A History of Racial Formation, Dr Cecilia Márquez, Duke University assistant professor, traces the growth of Latino populations in places like North Carolina and Georgia. “On the one hand, we’ve been in the south for decades,” Márquez said. “On the other, if you think about it historically, it’s only been a relatively short amount of time. And it takes a long time to build infrastructure for communities.” Between 2010 and 2022, North Carolina saw another 45% growth in the state’s Latino population, according to Carolina Demography, the applied demography unit of the Carolina Population Center at UNC-Chapel Hill. The organization’s executive director, Nathan Dollar, said understanding demographic change is essential so that communities are best served and that demographic change is related to “just about everything” – including grocery stores. What sets Compare Foods apart from competitors large and small is that its selection is tied to the tastes – and composition – of the places where the stores are located. Depending on where you are shopping – whether it’s in Baltimore or one of its Charlotte locations – that location might cater more to Caribbean communities or to those from Central America. Omar Jorge Peña says this is by design because the chain is structured to respond to local communities. Each store is individually owned and operated, usually by a member of the Peña family, though there are also independent operators trained in Compare Foods’ systems. “We can respond to changing demographics much more quickly than our competitors because we’re not being dictated from the corporate office down,” the CEO said. “When the store owner or manager realizes that the demographics in the store neighborhood have changed from Ecuadorian to Honduran, they can make the decision to update the merchandising and product selection in that store to match those changes. It’s part of the beauty of our system that we can adapt quickly to what’s happening around us.” North Carolina isn’t the only state where you can track Latino migration through the proliferation of markets that serve newly arrived immigrants. In the 1990s, California saw a boom of Mexican markets like Northgate González, due to one of the largest arrivals of migrants to the US. Immigrants from the Korean peninsula represent the 10th largest immigrant population in the United States, and the origin story and evolution of the beloved Korean-American grocery store chain H Mart is broadly similar to that of Compare’s. The store’s founder, Il Yeon Kwon, left South Korea in the late 1970s and opened the first H Mart in Queens, New York, in 1982. So-called “ethnic markets” that primarily offer foreign products are estimated to be worth $46.1bn and they are a growing percentage of the US grocery industry. But it’s unclear if small, immigrant-run tiendas and carnicerías are counted as part of this larger market landscape. Even in deeply rural areas across the south, before the advent of larger supermarkets like Compare, these small businesses have offered a place to find familiar ingredients and for newly arrived immigrants to send remittances to family back home. The Guatemalan cookbook author Sandra Gutierrez recalls what it was like to live in North Carolina before “the new southern-Latino movement”. Gutierrez coined the term in her 2011 cookbook The New Southern-Latino Table. Back in 1985 when she first moved to the south, Gutierrez said she could only find cilantro in Asian stores sold as “Chinese parsley”, and she had to special-order black beans. She made do with substituting similar ingredients. Gutierrez transformed grits into masa for tamales. Now, Gutierrez says she can go to Compare Foods and find products from Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Brazil and just about every other Latin American country. The ingredients are easy to find because the grocery store’s aisles are often broken down according to country, speaking to Latino immigration that’s not just larger but increasingly more diverse. “Before Compare was here, little mom-and-pop tiendas owned by Mexican and Central American families helped feed us,” Gutierrez said. “Now that Compare is here, we can find food from all over Latin America. It’s a phenomenal way to shop, and the south is a wonderful place to be right now” due to culinary cross-pollination. In the 1990s, when Gutierrez joined the Cary News to pen a weekly southern food column, making her the first Latin American food columnist in the country, she quickly realized that the southern-Latino crossover happening in her home kitchen was occurring region wide. Readers wrote in to ask about chipotle mayonnaise and a friend’s “southern dinner” included potato salad, deviled eggs and a roasted cabrito served with tostones. This is why when she wrote The New Southern Latino Table, she didn’t focus on a state like Texas. When immigration to North Carolina rose in the 1990s, it wasn’t just immigrants from Mexico who settled in the area; it was Central American laborers, refugees from Venezuela and Cuba and Colombian students. Gutierrez added: “It really is something incredible to live during a period of time in a particular place where you can actually see a movement being born, being adopted and being accepted to such a point that entire grocery stores and entire food industries are coming out of it. In our modern days, I don’t think there’s anywhere else in the world outside of the south where we have been able to see it from the moment it was born and to see how it’s growing and how it’s being transformed.”",2024-03-29 12:00:41,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/mar/29/new-york-grocery-store-latino-immigration,The Guardian,671,u almost 25 still perfect produce perfectly ripe prickly pear favorite north grocery store 45yearold hard find bustling new south city first 1999 used challenge first came north said every would drive 30 40 get went maybe 10 15 see grocery serve compare everything u grocery store community hub many newly u south expansion new york chain smaller across region southeast relatively low 1990s north specifically led nation growth population 1990 2000 demographic almost 400 according census bureau one four 2060 power shift many agricultural otherwise left traditional west southwest sun belt inspired compare parent company aurora grocery group similarly relocate southward new york family business compare came new york city republic 1970 bodega job eventually led purchase corner store effectively serving entry point business 1989 brother first compare new york chain across east coast southeast many run family 13 also launch business north first compare small town outside 2003 since state become central grocery aurora grocery compare business north said multiple south first surging population large pool potential departure grocery like bilo available north particularly prime location close priority future company expand northward towards southward towards westward towards taken grocery chain like compare find foothold south entirely surprise book making south history racial formation duke university assistant professor growth like north one hand weve south said think historically relatively short amount time long time build infrastructure 2010 2022 north saw another 45 growth population according demography applied demography unit population center hill executive director dollar said understanding demographic change essential best demographic change related everything grocery compare apart large small selection tied composition depending shopping whether one location might cater central design chain structured respond local store individually usually member family though also independent trained compare respond much quickly corporate office said store owner manager store neighborhood make decision update product selection store match part beauty system adapt quickly whats happening around u north state track migration proliferation serve newly 1990s saw boom like due one u peninsula represent 10th immigrant population united origin story evolution beloved grocery store chain h mart broadly similar founder left south korea late 1970s first h mart new york 1982 ethnic primarily offer foreign worth 461bn growing percentage u grocery industry unclear small part market landscape even deeply rural across south like compare small place find familiar newly send family back home cookbook author like live north new movement term 2011 cookbook new table back 1985 first south said could find sold parsley black made substituting similar grit masa go compare find republic brazil every country easy find grocery often broken according country speaking immigration thats increasingly diverse compare little central feed u said compare find food phenomenal way shop south wonderful place right due culinary 1990s news pen weekly southern food column making first food columnist country quickly crossover happening home kitchen region wide wrote ask mayonnaise southern dinner included potato salad deviled wrote new southern table didnt focus state like immigration north rose 1990s wasnt settled area central added really something incredible live period time particular place actually see movement born adopted accepted point entire grocery entire food coming modern day dont think there anywhere else world outside south able see moment born see growing nimble new york grocery store immigration south
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,672,Rust to riches? Ohio city’s fortunes set to rise with flying taxi startup,"For a decade, Dayton in south-west Ohio has fought to shed its rust belt past. New apartment blocks, hotels and breweries have cut into a landscape dominated by derelict warehouses and general industrial decline. But today, that transformation is shifting gears and taking to the skies. A town that 120 years ago produced the pioneers of human flight the Wright brothers is set to build hundreds of futuristic flying taxis each year. It’s here in Dayton – rather than in its home state of California – that Joby Aviation is planning to manufacture its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Joby’s Didier Papadopoulos cites a couple of reasons for the company’s plans to employ up to 2,000 people at a $500m facility north of Dayton scheduled to open next year. For one, it “has a tremendous history in aviation – it’s the birthplace of flight”, Papadopoulos said recently. Also, he remarked, “Ohio is home to a talented and skilled manufacturing workforce, and we expect to hire and train a mixture of both local and national applicants.” The aircraft, slated to appear at the Olympics in Paris this summer, are expected by some to reshape not just air travel but the wider mobility industry. A host of startups and established companies have dived into electric flying vehicles in recent years, and the global eVTOL market is expected to be worth $1tn by 2040. Joby has positioned itself as the “Uber of the skies”. Its aircraft have space for a pilot and four passengers and can reach speeds up to 200mph (322km/h); in November it held a test flight in lower Manhattan and the company says it can reach JFK international airport from Manhattan in just seven minutes compared with the hour it can take by taxi or subway. The company hopes to launch commercial flights in New York City and Los Angeles in 2025 and has signed a home-to-airport taxi service with Delta Air Lines. With the Joe Biden White House committing billions of dollars to a new era of manufacturing, part of a wider move to reduce the US’s dependency on other countries for key technological products, much of that money is landing in the industrial midwest. Millions of dollars of government incentives have been committed to new semiconductor and other mobility projects in Ohio, Michigan and other states that are often more commonly associated with socio-economic decline. For Dayton, a city that has lost close to half its population since the 1960s, the move could spark a major turnaround. “Ohio was the first state to put together an advanced air mobility plan,” said a Joby liaison, Ted Angel, of the Dayton Development Coalition. “No other state had been leaning that far forward.” Several miles east of Dayton, the Wright-Patterson air force base is the largest single-site employer in Ohio and boasts huge federal military research and development spending power that has, in turn, attracted a growing ecosystem of aviation and aerospace partners and startups to the area. In nearby Springfield, a city of 60,000 people that has also suffered through years of manufacturing closures, the US air force has been helping build a new National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence, which is expected to serve as a working home for aviation companies from South Korea and elsewhere. “For a product like the one [Joby] is producing, there is both a defense and security market, and a consumer market,” said the Ohio State University’s Jennifer Clark, an expert in regional planning. “That’s pretty normal for the aviation sector. Almost every aviation company you can think of has both defense and civilian manufacturing. The Dayton area is very familiar with that.” While the creation of thousands of new skilled jobs in economically challenged regions such as Dayton has broadly been welcomed, some in those communities are likely to bear a cost. Known for years as a place with ample affordable housing, Dayton’s rising rental prices last year prompted residents to form a tenants’ union. In other cities, large manufacturing plants have fueled large property price increases. Ohio’s state government is expected to deploy up to $325m in taxpayers’ dollars to help Joby build its facilities. Dayton’s Montgomery county has also proposed giving $1m to the company to help it with “development costs”. “There is a school of thought among economic development people that it is not the best use of taxpayer money to do these recruitment-retention-expansion deals with individual firms because it is risky,” Clark said. “Most of the research indicates that if you want to do sustainable economic development, you want to invest in your institutional infrastructure overall. But that’s the long game.” And while Joby’s initial announcement suggested that 2,000 jobs would be created, that number is now expected to be closer to 1,200, with the potential to rise. Still, for a region whose population has declined for decades, investment from companies at the cutting edge of mobility is seen as a welcome shot in the arm. The fact that the new plant sits atop a former US post office airmail facility is evidence of that. Angel of the Dayton Development Coalition said a host of community colleges and universities around the region have adjusted by opening training programs to establish a pipeline of technicians for Joby and other aviation firms. “I couldn’t count how many tours with schoolchildren we have done,” he said. “The [new] revolution of flight is happening right here.”",2024-03-29 11:00:37,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/29/flying-taxi-joby-aviation-ohio,The Guardian,672,decade southwest fought shed rust belt past new apartment cut landscape dominated derelict general industrial decline today transformation shifting taking sky town 120 ago produced human flight wright set build futuristic flying taxi year rather home state aviation manufacture electric vertical landing aircraft couple employ 2000 people 500m facility north open next year one tremendous history aviation birthplace flight said recently also home talented skilled expect hire train mixture local national aircraft appear summer reshape air travel mobility industry host established electric flying recent global market worth 1tn 2040 positioned sky aircraft space pilot four reach 200mph 322kmh test flight lower company reach international airport seven hour take taxi subway company launch commercial new york city 2025 taxi service delta air joe white house new era part move reduce dependency key technological much money landing industrial million government new semiconductor mobility michigan often commonly associated socioeconomic decline city lost close half population since 1960s move could spark major turnaround first state put together advanced air mobility plan said liaison ted angel development coalition state leaning far forward several east air force base employer huge federal military research development spending power turn growing ecosystem aviation area nearby city 60000 people also u air force helping build new national advanced air mobility center excellence serve working home aviation south korea elsewhere product like one defense security market consumer market said state clark expert regional thats pretty normal aviation sector almost every aviation company think defense civilian area familiar creation new skilled economically broadly likely bear cost known place ample affordable housing rising rental last year form union large large property price state government deploy 325m help build county also giving 1m company help development school thought among economic development people best use taxpayer money individual risky clark said research want sustainable economic development want invest institutional infrastructure overall thats long game initial announcement 2000 would number closer 1200 potential rise still region whose population declined investment cutting edge mobility seen welcome shot arm fact new plant atop former u post office airmail facility evidence angel development coalition said host community around region opening training establish pipeline aviation count many done said new revolution flight happening right rust rich set rise flying taxi
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,673,Russia-Ukraine war: White House says US passed written warning of Moscow attack to Russia – as it happened,"The White House on Thursday described Russia’s allegation that Ukraine was involved in the attack on the Crocus city concert hall as “nonsense”, saying it was clear that Islamic State was “solely responsible”. According to Reuters, in a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow. Here’s a recap of today’s latest developments: Russian investigators claimed on Thursday they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow last week were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”. While it described the nature of the alleged evidence, it did not publish it. In a statement, the state investigative committee claimed the attackers had received significant amounts of cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine, and that another suspect involved in terrorist financing had been detained. The White House on Thursday described Russia’s allegation that Ukraine was involved in the attack on the Crocus city concert hall as “nonsense”, saying it was clear that Islamic State was “solely responsible”. In a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow. Russia vetoed on Thursday the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme. The move comes amid US-led accusations that North Korea has transferred weapons to Russia, which Moscow has used in its war in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the accusations. The White House called Russia’s veto of the renewal of North Korea sanctions monitors a “reckless action” that “further undermines” the UN security council’s actions on North Korea. South Korea’s UN ambassador Joonkook Hwang said the veto was “almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed”, while the deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told the council that Moscow had “undermined the prospect of the peaceful, diplomatic resolution of one of the world’s most dangerous nuclear proliferation issues”. Russia has no designs on any Nato country and will not attack Poland, the Baltic states or the Czech Republic but if the west supplies F-16 fighters to Ukraine then they will be shot down by Russian forces, president Vladimir Putin said late on Wednesday. “The idea that we will attack some other country – Poland, the Baltic States, and the Czechs are also being scared – is complete nonsense. It’s just drivel,” Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript released on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has warned that Vladimir Putin will push Russia’s war “very quickly” on to Nato soil unless he is stopped in Ukraine. In an interview with CBS, Zelenskiy acknowledged that his troops are not prepared to defend against another imminent major Russian offensive, and highlighted the urgency for American Patriot missile defense systems and more artillery. Poland’s prime minister on Thursday hosted his Ukrainian counterpart for long-awaited talks designed to ease friction over Ukrainian farm imports and border blockades by disgruntled Polish farmers. On Thursday, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk welcomed his counterpart Denys Shmyhal to Warsaw. Putin’s foreign intelligence chief paid a visit to North Korea this week to deepen bilateral cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang and discuss broader regional security, Russia’s spy service said on Thursday. Sergei Naryshkin, the head the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, visited Pyongyang on 25-27 March, the SVR said. North Korea’s KCNA state media first reported the visit, said Reuters. The Kremlin gave no indication on Thursday that Russian president Vladimir Putin plans to visit family members of those killed in last Friday’s attack on a Moscow concert hall, which killed 143 people. “If any contacts are necessary, we will inform you accordingly,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, when asked if Putin planned to meet family members of the dead. Security measures in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv will be tightened after a spate of Russian ballistic missile attacks and threats of escalation, a city official said on Thursday. Russia staged concerted airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy system last week in what Moscow said was part of a series of “revenge” strikes in response to Kyiv’s bombardment of Russian regions. Russia struck the north-eastern city of Kharkiv with aerial bombs on Wednesday for the first time since 2022, killing at least one civilian and wounding 16 others, local officials said. The airstrikes caused widespread damage, hitting several residential buildings and damaging the city’s institute for emergency surgery. Authorities in the Mykolaiv region, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, said 12 people were injured and six residential buildings were damaged in a Russian strike on the city on Wednesday afternoon with a ballistic missile. In an overnight attack on the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, Shahed drones struck a residential area, injuring two women aged 72 and 74, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Rescue services said seven buildings were damaged. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has appointed Oleh Ivashchenko as the new head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. A Russian military aircraft crashed into the sea on Thursday off the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the Russian-installed governor of the region, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said. The pilot safely ejected and was picked up by rescuers, he added. The Kremlin said on Thursday complete silence was needed when it came to discussions about possible prisoner exchanges involving Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter arrested in Russia a year ago on suspicion of espionage. Gershkovich, 32, became the first US journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the cold war when he was detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on 29 March. The reporter, the Wall Street Journal and the US government all deny he is a spy. Ukraine asked western allies for additional air defences in an extraordinary meeting of the Nato-Ukraine Council that took place at ambassadors’ level on Thursday. Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian defence minister, briefed the ambassadors and “called on Nato member states to provide additional air defence systems and missiles to protect Ukrainian cities and citizens”. Ukraine’s foreign minister arrived in New Delhi on Thursday for a two-day visit to boost bilateral ties and cooperation with India, which considers Russia a time-tested ally from the cold war-era. Poland’s Internal Security Agency (ABW) has carried out searches as part of an investigation with other European security services into alleged Russian espionage, the agency said on Thursday. French authorities uncovered a website containing a fake recruitment drive for French volunteers to join the war in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Thursday. The site has now been taken down by French services, a government source, who asked not to be named, told AFP without giving further details on the nature of the operation. The Moscow attacks appear to have been the work of the group’s branch in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP). ISKP, which was founded in 2015, has targeted propaganda and outreach to central Asia and previously has made multiple efforts to launch recruits into Europe and Russia. Turkey has also been a focus of activity. The four suspects presented in court by Russia were from Tajikistan. Islamic State (IS) remains defeated in its core strongholds of the Middle East but has made significant progress in Africa and parts of south Asia, winning territory and resources that could serve as a launchpad for a new campaign of extremist violence, analysts and officials believe. European governments have moved to their highest levels of alert for years after the attack on a concert hall in Moscow last week by militants from IS that killed 140 people. The attack in Moscow, the most lethal Islamist extremist operation ever in Europe, was claimed by IS, which, officials believe, has been planning new operations against European targets for several years. Between 2015 and 2019, when IS ran a so-called caliphate across a swath of land it controlled in eastern Syria and western Iraq, the group’s central leadership had little need of its newly established affiliates to launch operations in Europe, as it had all resources to hand with foreign recruits, money and training camps. This led to a series of lethal attacks in France and Belgium. However, years of counterterrorism operations by local security forces, the US and others, have degraded IS in its former strongholds, and the group is fragmented and weak. Western security officials with close knowledge of IS in Iraq and Syria said the group had abandoned its project of rebuilding the so-called caliphate but that successful strikes against international targets were seen as “good for morale and the IS brand and compensate for failure closer to home”. Here’s more from the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, who has dismissed as “nonsense” Russia’s allegations of Ukraine’s involvement in last week’s attack on Moscow’s Crocus City concert hall. In a briefing to reporters on Thursday, Kirby said the US passed to Russian security services a written warning of an extremist attack on large gatherings in Moscow, one of many provided in advance. Kirby said: It is abundantly clear that Isis (Islamic State) was solely responsible for the horrific attack in Moscow last week. In fact, the United States tried to help prevent this terrorist attack and the Kremlin knows this. He was speaking shortly after Russian investigators claimed they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in last week’s attacks were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”. Kirby described the Russian allegations as “nonsense and propaganda”, adding that the US had provided multiple advance warnings to Russian authorities of extremist attacks on concerts and large gatherings in Moscow. The US passed, “following normal procedures and through established channels that have been employed many times previously ... a warning in writing to Russian security services”, he added. At least five independent journalists in Moscow have been detained by police over the past 24 hours, according to OVD-Info, a leading Russian human rights organisation. SOTAvision journalist Antonina Favorskaya was taken for interrogation late Wednesday after serving 10 days’ jail for laying flowers at late opposition politician Alexei Navalny’s grave, AFP reported. Her colleagues, Alexandra Astakhova and Anastasia Musatova, who came to meet her at the detention centre where she was set to be released, were also detained by police, SOTAVision said. SOTAvision reporter Ekaterina Anikievich and Konstantin Zharov from RusNews were arrested by police early on Thursday while filming near Favorskaya’s home, it said. Zharov told RusNews that he was beaten while in custody: They kicked me, put a foot on my head, twisted my fingers, mocked me when I tried to get up, demanded to show my rucksack as if it might contain explosives. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he has spoken with the US speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, in which he urged him to hold a vote approving US military aid for Ukraine. Posting to social media, the Ukrainian president wrote: Quick passage of US aid to Ukraine by Congress is vital. We recognize that there are differing views in the House of Representatives on how to proceed, but the key is to keep the issue of aid to Ukraine as a unifying factor. I spoke with @SpeakerJohnson and thanked him personally, both parties, the American people, and President Biden for their critical support of Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.I briefed Speaker Johnson on the battlefield situation, specifically the… The US announced a new package of weapons and equipment to Ukraine earlier this month, as the bill to fund military aid has stalled in Congress amid Republican opposition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has warned that Vladimir Putin will push Russia’s war “very quickly” on to Nato soil unless he is stopped in Ukraine. In an interview with CBS published today, Zelenskiy acknowledged that his troops are not prepared to defend against another imminent major Russian offensive. “We need help now,” the Ukrainian leader said, highlighting the urgency for American Patriot missile defense systems and more artillery. Zelenskiy warned that if Ukraine does lose, Putin will not stop there. He said: At the moment, it’s us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany … This aggression, and Putin’s army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they’re the Nato members. He added that Ukraine is grateful for US support “but the United States don’t have the war going on … but it can come to Europe, and to the United States of America. It can come very quickly to Europe.” It has gone 6pm in Kyiv and 7pm in Moscow. Here is a recap of today’s latest developments: Russian investigators claimed on Thursday they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow last week were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”. While it described the nature of the alleged evidence, it did not publish it. In a statement, the state investigative committee claimed the attackers had received significant amounts of cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine, and that another suspect involved in terrorist financing had been detained. The White House on Thursday described Russia’s allegation that Ukraine was involved in the attack on the Crocus city concert hall as “nonsense”, saying it was clear that Islamic State was “solely responsible”. In a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow. Russia vetoed on Thursday the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme. The move comes amid US-led accusations that North Korea has transferred weapons to Russia, which Moscow has used in its war in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the accusations. The White House called Russia’s veto of the renewal of North Korea sanctions monitors a “reckless action” that “further undermines” the UN security council’s actions on North Korea. South Korea’s UN ambassador Joonkook Hwang said the veto was “almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed”, while the deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told the council that Moscow had “undermined the prospect of the peaceful, diplomatic resolution of one of the world’s most dangerous nuclear proliferation issues”. Russia has no designs on any Nato country and will not attack Poland, the Baltic states or the Czech Republic but if the west supplies F-16 fighters to Ukraine then they will be shot down by Russian forces, president Vladimir Putin said late on Wednesday. “The idea that we will attack some other country – Poland, the Baltic States, and the Czechs are also being scared – is complete nonsense. It’s just drivel,” Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript released on Thursday. Poland’s prime minister on Thursday hosted his Ukrainian counterpart for long-awaited talks designed to ease friction over Ukrainian farm imports and border blockades by disgruntled Polish farmers. On Thursday, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk welcomed his counterpart Denys Shmyhal to Warsaw. Putin’s foreign intelligence chief paid a visit to North Korea this week to deepen bilateral cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang and discuss broader regional security, Russia’s spy service said on Thursday. Sergei Naryshkin, the head the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, visited Pyongyang on 25-27 March, the SVR said. North Korea’s KCNA state media first reported the visit, said Reuters. The Kremlin gave no indication on Thursday that Russian president Vladimir Putin plans to visit family members of those killed in last Friday’s attack on a Moscow concert hall, which killed 143 people. “If any contacts are necessary, we will inform you accordingly,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, when asked if Putin planned to meet family members of the dead. Security measures in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv will be tightened after a spate of Russian ballistic missile attacks and threats of escalation, a city official said on Thursday. Russia staged concerted airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy system last week in what Moscow said was part of a series of “revenge” strikes in response to Kyiv’s bombardment of Russian regions. Russia struck the north-eastern city of Kharkiv with aerial bombs on Wednesday for the first time since 2022, killing at least one civilian and wounding 16 others, local officials said. The airstrikes caused widespread damage, hitting several residential buildings and damaging the city’s institute for emergency surgery. Authorities in the Mykolaiv region, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, said 12 people were injured and six residential buildings were damaged in a Russian strike on the city on Wednesday afternoon with a ballistic missile. In an overnight attack on the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, Shahed drones struck a residential area, injuring two women aged 72 and 74, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Rescue services said seven buildings were damaged. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has appointed Oleh Ivashchenko as the new head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. A Russian military aircraft crashed into the sea on Thursday off the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the Russian-installed governor of the region, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said. The pilot safely ejected and was picked up by rescuers, he added. The Kremlin said on Thursday complete silence was needed when it came to discussions about possible prisoner exchanges involving Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter arrested in Russia a year ago on suspicion of espionage. Gershkovich, 32, became the first US journalist arrested on spying charges in Russia since the cold war when he was detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB) on 29 March. The reporter, the Wall Street Journal and the US government all deny he is a spy. Ukraine asked western allies for additional air defences in an extraordinary meeting of the Nato-Ukraine Council that took place at the ambassadors level on Thursday. Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian defence minister, briefed the ambassadors and “called on Nato member states to provide additional air defence systems and missiles to protect Ukrainian cities and citizens”. Ukraine’s foreign minister arrived in New Delhi on Thursday for a two-day visit to boost bilateral ties and cooperation with India, which considers Russia a time-tested ally from the cold war era. Poland’s Internal Security Agency (ABW) has carried out searches as part of an investigation with other European security services into alleged Russian espionage, the agency said on Thursday. French authorities uncovered a website containing a fake recruitment drive for French volunteers to join the war in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Thursday. The site has been taken down by French services, a government source, who asked not to be named, told AFP without giving further details on the nature of the operation. Reuters have more detail on the Russian military aircraft that crashed into the sea off of Sevastopol (see 15:35 GMT) According to Reuters, the Russian military aircraft crashed into the sea on Thursday off the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the Russian-installed governor of the region said. The pilot safely ejected and was picked up by rescuers, Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said. Earlier, Russian Telegram channels reported that a Russian Su-35 fighter jet had crashed near Sevastopol. It was not clear what caused the incident. Russian investigators claimed on Thursday they had uncovered evidence that the gunmen who killed more than 140 people in an attack on a concert hall near Moscow last week were linked to “Ukrainian nationalists”, reports Reuters. Russia has said from the outset that it is pursuing a Ukrainian link to the attack, even though Kyiv has denied it and the militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility. According to Reuters, in a statement, the state investigative committee said for the first time that it had uncovered evidence of a Ukrainian link. While it described the nature of the alleged evidence, it did not publish it. “As a result of working with detained terrorists, studying the technical devices seized from them, and analysing information about financial transactions, evidence was obtained of their connection with Ukrainian nationalists,” the statement said. It claimed the attackers had received significant amounts of cash and cryptocurrency from Ukraine, and that another suspect involved in terrorist financing had been detained. Eleven people were arrested in the first 24 hours after last Friday’s attack and eight of these, including the four suspected gunmen, have been placed in pre-trial detention. Seven are from Tajikistan and the other from Kyrgyzstan. The US had publicly warned before the concert shooting that it had received intelligence of a possible attack by extremists in Russia. US officials say they believe it was Islamic State Khorasan, the network’s Afghan branch, that was responsible. Russia says it is suspicious that the US was able to name the alleged perpetrator of the attack so soon after it took place. The head of Russia’s FSB Security Service said earlier this week, again without providing evidence, that he believed Ukraine, along with the US and the UK, were involved. Western security analysts have said that the attack raised questions about the resourcing and priorities of Russian intelligence agencies that have been heavily focused on the Ukraine war and the need to stamp out opposition to it within Russia. Reuters have a breaking news line on a Russian military plane which has crashed in the sea near Sevastopol, according to a local governor. More deatails soon … The White House on Thursday described Russia’s allegation that Ukraine was involved in the attack on the Crocus city concert hall as “nonsense”, saying it was clear that Islamic State was “solely responsible”. According to Reuters, in a briefing to reporters, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that the US passed a written warning of an extremist attack to Russian security services, one of many provided in advance to Moscow. The White House has called Russia’s veto of the renewal of North Korea sanctions monitors a “reckless action” that “further undermines” the UN security council’s actions on North Korea. “This is almost comparable to destroying a CCTV to avoid being caught red-handed,” South Korea’s UN ambassador Joonkook Hwang said of Russia’s veto of the renewal of North Korea sanctions monitors, reports Reuters. “Moscow has undermined the prospect of the peaceful, diplomatic resolution of one of the world’s most dangerous nuclear proliferation issues,” deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told the council. According to Reuters, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia questioned the experts’ work, telling the security council before the vote: “Its work is increasingly being reduced to playing into the hands of western approaches, reprinting biased information and analysing newspaper headlines and poor quality photos.” North Korea has been under UN sanctions for its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes since 2006 and those measures have been strengthened over the years. The panel of independent experts has monitored those UN sanctions for the past 15 years, reporting twice a year to the security council and recommending action for improved implementation of the measures. The mandate for the current panel of experts will expire on 30 April 2024. The panel’s most recent report was made public earlier this month and said it was investigating dozens of suspected cyber-attacks by North Korea that raked in $3bn to help it further develop its nuclear weapons programme. “The panel, through its work to expose sanctions non-compliance, was an inconvenience for Russia,” said the UK’s UN ambassador Barbara Woodward. “But let me be clear to Russia – the sanctions regime remains in place and the UK remains committed to holding DPRK to account for its compliance.” For the past several years the UN security council has been divided over how to deal with Pyongyang. Russia and China, veto powers along with the US, the UK and France, have said more sanctions will not help and want such measures to be eased. China and Russia say joint military drills by the US and South Korea provoke Pyongyang, while Washington accuses Beijing and Moscow of emboldening North Korea by shielding it from more sanctions. Reuters has a couple of breaking news lines on the wires about Russia’s investigative committee saying it has obtained evidence of links between the Crocus city concert hall attackers and Ukraine. Reuters are citing the Russian state news agency RIA. According to the RIA report, as shared by Reuters, Russian investigators said another suspect involved in “terrorist financing” has been detained. More details soon … Russia vetoed on Thursday the annual renewal of a panel of experts monitoring enforcement of longstanding UN sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programme, reports Reuters. The move comes amid US-led accusations that North Korea has transferred weapons to Russia, which Moscow has used in its war in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied the accusations, but vowed last year to deepen military relations. China abstained from the vote on Thursday, while the remaining 13 council members voted in favor. Authorities in the Mykolaiv region, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, said 12 people were injured and six residential buildings were damaged in a Russian strike on the city on Wednesday afternoon with a ballistic missile, according to the Associated Press (AP).In an overnight attack on the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, Shahed drones struck a residential area, injuring two women aged 72 and 74, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Rescue services said seven buildings were damaged.The Black Sea city of Odesa repelled three missile and drone attacks, officials said. A duty that the EU plans to impose on Russian wheat supplies will hit the European market, Sergei Dankvert, head of Russian agriculture watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor, was quoted as saying by state-owned news agency Tass. The imposition of duties could lead to a loss of grain handling capacity, while Russia would be able to divert to other markets the 2.5-3m metric tons of grain it had been shipping to the EU, Dankvert said, according to Reuters. French authorities have uncovered a website containing a fake recruitment drive for French volunteers to join the war in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Thursday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The site has now been taken down by French services, a government source, who asked not to be named, told AFP without giving further details on the nature of the operation. The site, which is now inaccessible, said 200,000 French people were invited to “enlist in Ukraine”, with immigrants given priority. A link to the site – that resembled the French army’s genuine recruitment portal – had been posted on X, the French defence ministry said. “The site is a fake government site,” the ministry said, also on X, “and has been reposted by malevolent accounts as part of a disinformation campaign”. According to AFP, the ministry did not name any suspects in the website spoof, but a government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the site bore “the hallmarks of a Russian or pro-Russian effort as part of a disinformation campaign claiming that the French army is preparing to send troops to Ukraine”. French president Emmanuel Macron angered the Russian leadership last month by hardening his tone on the conflict sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, refusing to rule out sending ground troops and insisting Europe had to do all that was needed for a Russian defeat. Similar recent examples of disinformation posts included pictures of French army convoys wrongly presented as moving towards the Ukrainian border, the official said. The fake website invited potential recruits to contact “unit commander Paul” for information about joining. The defence ministry and government cyber units are investigating, ministry staff told AFP. The French government has recently stepped up efforts to denounce and fight what it says are Russian disinformation and destabilisation campaigns aimed at undermining French public support for Ukraine

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,674,Michael Gove has ‘zero sympathy’ for ‘arrogant’ Thames Water in funding crisis – as it happened,"Thames Water, the UK’s largest water company, edged closer to being taken over by the government on Thursday after its shareholders balked at the prospect of giving it £500m after the regulator refused to allow it to raise prices as high as they wanted. The refusal to stump up the cash could mean that Thames Water is forced into special administration if it is unable to find new investment before its cash reserves run dry at some point next year. The company’s chief executive, Chris Weston, said it is “a long way off” temporary nationalisation, but did not rule it out. The debacle has raised questions about what Labour’s approach will be if – as generally expected – it wins a general election in the next year. Labour and the Conservative party’s Michael Gove said they do not want taxpayers or bill payers to pay the cost, but neither have so far backed nationalisation either temporarily or permanently. In other business news today: The owner of the Independent has bought the UK operations of BuzzFeed, the entertainment website. The Sellafield nuclear waste dump is to be prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences, the industry watchdog has said. The European arm of the Japanese clothing and homeware retailer Muji is to appoint administrators, in another gloomy signal for the UK’s struggling high street. The collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge is likely to lead to the largest single marine insurance loss ever, the chair of Lloyd’s of London has said. Official figures have confirmed that the UK economy went into recession at the end of last year, after the latest estimate found it contracted in the last two quarters of 2023. Former crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, now convicted of fraud, told a US sentencing hearing “I am sorry” for “a series of bad decisions” that “haunts me every day”.

Enjoy your Easter eggs and do join us again on Tuesday. JJ The owner of the Independent news website has taken over the UK arm of publisher BuzzFeed, in a deal that brings to an end the latter’s volatile time operating on its own in the UK. The Independent will gain BuzzFeed Inc’s UK website, editorial staff and website technology as part of a long-term licensing deal. BuzzFeed burst on to the UK media scene in 2013, and garnered large audiences – particularly among younger readers – with viral articles and “listicles”, before branching out into a respected news operation. However, it struggled to convert its audience numbers into profits. In 2017 it cut back its workforce, before disbanding its BuzzFeed News UK team entirely in 2020. Last year it closed the US news team as well. Under the deal the Independent, which has also faced financial problems that forced the closure of its print newspaper operation, will also take over HuffPost in the UK, food website Tasty, and Seasoned, a brand aimed at black British audiences. The Unison union also wants the government to renationalise Thames Water to prevent jobs from being at risk. It is unclear how many – if any – jobs are under threat. Cuts might be conceivable if the company decided to try to cut costs in the future, but for now it is insisting it is “business as usual”. Donna Rowe-Merriman, Unison’s head of environment, said: It’s clear the business model for Thames Water has failed and the company is unviable. Even Thames Water’s own shareholders refuse to keep it afloat. Yet again, staff are facing an uncertain future with jobs at risk and no hope of much-needed investment. Customers will have to contend with poor water quality and rising bills. This utter chaos is further evidence the government needs to renationalise Thames Water now. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, has responded to Michael Gove’s anger about Thames Water. He said anger is not enough from the government. The Lib Dems have been calling for special administration for Thames Water – a temporary nationalisation – for the last fortnight, arguing that it would keep bills down. Davey told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme (via PA) that the government, and communities minister Michael Gove, need to take action against Thames Water. Davey said: And it’s alright Michael Gove being cross, well where are the Conservatives in this? The Conservatives have failed to tackle this over all their time, and we really need now to get a grip of this. People are fed up of this sewage problem across our country, Thames Water one of the worst examples of it, and they’re looking to the government to take some action. Thames Water must “carry the can” for the company’s management failings and not pass higher bills on to consumers, housing and communities secretary Michael Gove has said. The company – and by extension its shareholders – have taken advantage of customers (who cannot switch provider from the natural monopoly) and have not invested enough he said in broadcast interviews. Via PA, Gove said: I think the leadership of Thames Water has been a disgrace. I think for years now we have seen customers of Thames Water taken advantage of by successive management teams that have been taking out profits and not investing as they should have been. When I was environment secretary I called this out. They haven’t changed their ways. I have zero sympathy for the leadership of Thames Water. In my own constituency I have seen how they have behaved in a high-handed and arrogant way towards the consumers who pay their bills. So the answer is not to hit the consumers, the answer is for the management team to look to their own approach and ask themselves why they are in this difficult situation, and of course the answer is because of serial mismanagement for which they must carry the can. The US economy grew at a faster rate than thought at first in the final three months of 2023, surprising economists who had not expected an upward revision. US GDP grew by 3.4% in the final quarter compared to the same quarter a year earlier, according to the final estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). That was up from the 3.2% measured in the second reading. The BEA said the faster growth was thanks to upward revisions to consumer spending and non-residential fixed investment. Reuters reports that the growth rate is well above what the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would consider as non-inflationary – suggesting that more interest rate hikes could be ahead. The economy is growing above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of 1.8% and continues to outperform its global peers despite 525 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from the US central bank since March 2022 to quell inflation. The ship that crashed into a Baltimore bridge, causing its collapse, radioed for help saying that it had lost all power, according to US government officials. Investigators from the US National Transportation Safety Board have started to carry out interviews with crew on the ship during the disaster, which killed several people, including maintenance workers and people driving across the bridge in the early hours. Reuters reported: The pilot was heard calling for tugboat assistance several minutes before the crash, the first indication of distress to harbor officials, followed by a radio report that the ship had lost all power and was approaching the bridge, NTSB officials said at a news briefing on Wednesday night. That account tallies with video of the ship which appears to show all of its lights flicking on and off before the impact. The Sellafield nuclear waste dump is to be prosecuted for alleged information technology security offences, the industry watchdog has said. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said on Thursday that it had notified the state-owned Cumbrian nuclear company that it would be prosecuted under industry security regulations. The prosecution follows the Guardian’s revelations last year of multiple cyber failings at the vast site, part of a year-long investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and an unhealthy workplace culture at Sellafield. You can read the full story here: And you can read the original revelations, from the Guardian’s Anna Isaac and Alex Lawson, here: Most of the pressure on Labour to back a permanent nationalisation of Thames Water, the UK’s largest water company, is coming from the left, both within the party and without. If a Labour government were to take power in a general election, which will take place in the next year, then the pressure on it to address the problems facing the privatised water utilities would mount. Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who plans to stand down at the next election, said that the UK should nationalise all of the privatised water companies in England and Wales. (Water companies in Scotland and Northern Ireland are controlled by the government.) Investors can see the writing on the wall for #ThamesWater. Endless sewage, supply outages and no money to sort it out. It's clear Thames Water cannot run this vital public service - none of these companies can. We need to bring them all into public ownership. @We_OwnIt And Labour Lord Sikka said the government should not give a “bailout” to Thames Water shareholders. Instead, it should let it go bust, then nationalise it, he said. Thames Water shareholders not minded to proceed with promised £3.25bn investment to keep it afloat.Want govt bailout, huge hike in customer bills after extracting billions in dividends.Were dividends legal?Let it go bust, nationalise at low price. https://t.co/r9wFEECVIT The GMB union, which represents many of Thames Water’s workers, has accused the company’s shareholders of “essentially blackmailing” customers and Ofwat. The investors have refused to invest £500m previously promised, because regulator Ofwat wants to enforce conditions that would hit their investments. GMB said that the shareholders should follow through on the investment. Gary Carter, GMB national officer, said:  Thames Water investors are essentially blackmailing customers and Ofwat. Assets and infrastructure are falling apart – instead of putting the money in to fix it, shareholders are refusing to pay a penny unless bills are allowed to rocket. Holding bill payers to ransom for costs after years of underinvestment is completely unacceptable. Shareholders need to think again and invest in Thames and the 8,000 strong workforce who keep the company afloat. The Thames Water investors were approached for comment. Thames Water’s parent company, Kemble Water Finance, has said that it will be unable to repay a debt that comes due in April, underlining the financial difficulties faced by the water company. The parent company has appointed advisers from turnaround consultant Alvarez & Marsal to handle negotiations with lenders and the holders of its debt. Thames Water’s complicated capital structure also means that debt related to subsidiary Thames Water (Kemble) Finance Plc will be affected. The companies (which are controlled by a motley crew of sovereign wealth funds and pension funds) said: Absent an investible proposition for the shareholders to provide new equity, Kemble Water Finance Limited (KWF) considers at the current time that it will not be possible to pay further interest payments and, unless an extension to the maturity of the facility is granted by lenders, it will not be able to refinance or repay a £190m facility which matures on 30 April 2024. In light of the above, KWF and Thames Water (Kemble) Finance Plc intend to approach their lenders and noteholders and request continued support in order to provide a stable platform while they engage with all key stakeholders.",2024-03-28 15:41:07,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/mar/28/thames-water-crisis-sewage-rivers-funding-uk-recession-gdp-economy-sterling-business-live,The

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,675,MLB 2024 predictions: will the Braves machine outdo the Dodgers’ stars?,"Baseball has always been unfair. It wasn’t “fair” when players were bound to the same teams for their whole careers, and it isn’t “fair” that the Dodgers spend so much more than the Athletics. But I’m more concerned about the many teams that could be spending more but abstain. AK Don’t hate the player or the game. Hate the MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and his Players Union counterpart, Tony Clark: the folks responsible for the Death Star sized loopholes which inspired Shohei Ohtani’s $700m contract. The deal pays the modern-day Babe Ruth just $2m a year until 2033, enabling baseball’s new evil empire to add even more pricey pieces. Unfair? Oh yeah, but it’s not LA’s fault: I’m kicking all the blame to baseball’s upper management. DL The business of baseball is inherently unfair and continues to tarnish a beautiful sport. It is fun to have a villain, though, and the Dodgers took advantage of their resources and attractive market to become just that. While the sheer volume of money the sky will rain on Ohtani for the rest of his life is astonishing, the disparity in spending between rich front offices and also-rans is nothing new. MJ No. Even though the Dodgers agreed to pay two players (Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto) more than $1bn combined over the next 12 years, they don’t have the highest payroll in Major League Baseball this season and aren’t paying the highest competitive balance tax. The Dodgers are doing what the smartest franchises – think Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson – have historically done: make their brand recognizable across the world. The Dodgers are wealthy, but they don’t hoard it like other owners do. It’s not a surprise that they lead MLB in attendance every year. GB The return of Oneil Cruz, the Pittsburgh Pirates’ 6ft 7in shortstop, will be a treat. Cruz missed all but nine games last year after breaking his leg in April. When Cruz is healthy – as he seems to be – nobody hits the ball harder, runs faster, or has a better arm. AK The evolution of the Baltimore Orioles. They’ve added ace Corbin Burnes, and are soon to have new ownership that could invest further in a young flock who surprised with 101 wins in 2023. That said, they sent super-prospect Jackson Holliday down to the minors to start the season, annoying his dad and the fan base. But he’ll be in B’more soon enough, adding even more dynamism to the best team in the AL East. DL Juan Soto and Aaron Judge hitting back-to-back. These two feeding off each other have a chance to be one of the most potent duos in MLB history. The Yankees remain one of baseball’s most reviled teams but it’s going to be hard to look away when these two are up. MJ The Dodgers will be under as much pressure to perform as any team since the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs were trying to end their historic World Series droughts. They may be the first “must-watch” team for devoted and casual baseball fans since the dominant Yankees teams of the late 1990s and early 2000s. GB Wyatt Langford. The No 4 pick in last summer’s draft will start the season in the lineup for the defending World Series winners, the Texas Rangers. He’ll share an outfield with Evan Carter, who shone as a rookie during Texas’ pennant run last year. I love watching athletes who can hit. AK Yoshinobu Yamamoto hasn’t had an ERA over 2.00 since 2020, that is, until opening day in Korea left the Dodgers’ new Japanese ace with a fat 45.00 on his ledger. How Yamamoto copes with the new, larger ball, his new surroundings, Major League bats and big league pressure will make his every start fascinating to watch. DL Evan Carter. The breakout star of the 2023 World Series is quite the intriguing watch headed into his first full season with the Rangers. It will surely come with ebbs and flows but if Carter’s OPS is anywhere near the .917 he carried in the postseason, watch out baseball. MJ Jackson Holliday. He won’t be with the Orioles on Opening Day, but it should not be long until the 20-year-old infielder arrives at Camden Yards. Jackson has already flashed a brilliant combination of power, speed and plate discipline that will add further excitement to one of the best young rosters in baseball. GB Juan Soto in the American League, as he’ll be the best outfielder on a team that also has the great Judge and plays in the New York spotlight. Fernando Tatis Jr in the National League; he took well to right field last year, and he’ll keep raking in the middle of San Diego’s lineup. AK Juan Soto is playing for a new contract and landed in just the right place to showcase his prodigious pop. Yankee Stadium is where left-handed power goes to graze and Soto will feast on its short porch to the tune of 50 plus home runs, earning AL honors. In the NL, Ronald Acuña Jr will be back in the winners circle. Last season included 41 homers, 73 stolen bases and over 200 hits in his epic MVP duel with Mookie Betts. While the Dodgers shortstop has it all, the ceiling keeps on rising for Acuna. DL Juan Soto already was one of the youngest players ever to hit 150 home runs. Now he’ll play half his games at Yankee Stadium, the third-most home run friendly ballpark for lefties. Expect Soto to make any swing adjustments necessary to crush the ball over that infamous short porch – and other parts of the stadium too. In the NL, Bryce Harper looks sharper than ever a year after his return from Tommy John surgery. Provided he stays healthy, his disciplined bat should produce a flashy, undeniable stat line. MJ In the AL, Adley Rutschman, the Orioles’ young catcher is already one of the league’s most disciplined hitters (he tied for third in the AL with 92 walks in 2023) and is an excellent defensive catcher (he was the only catcher in 2023 to start over 100 games and not have a passed ball). In the NL, Ronald Acuña Jr should receive stiff competition from Betts again, but the LA star may struggle to adapt to playing shortstop every day for the first time in his career. GB With the Yankees’ beset by pitching question marks (the result of both the Soto trade and an injury to Gerrit Cole), the Blue Jays can finally get over the hump after three wildcard losses in four years. Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr will hit. AK I’ve already poured my heart out about the Orioles, who, it’s true, do have some pitching holes, even after acquiring Burnes. And can you believe it, the savants over at FanGraphs have them at just 85 wins. How can that be? It would be a stunning regression. Even so, the Yankees, Soto and all, have a massive Cole in their rotation, with Gerritt out until, what? June? July? Next season? B’more are better than the Rays and Jays. They’ll repeat. DL This division is stacked but no team is as loaded as Baltimore. The Orioles are returning most of their starting lineup across the board and added a stud ace in Burnes. And while Holliday is starting the season in the minors, he could easily be called up in a week or two and end the season as Rookie of the Year. MJ The Orioles are built to win close to 100 games in the regular season if the pitching staff can remain healthy. They feature two potential MVP candidates (Rutschman and infielder Gunnar Henderson) and a number of young, powerful hitters that should make them one of the most fearsome offenses in baseball. Baltimore should thrive during an otherwise uncertain time for usually strong teams like the Yankees, Rays and Red Sox. GB Someone has to win the division, so it may as well be the Twins. The lineup lacks a star but has depth, and Pablo López, Joe Ryan, and Bailey Ober are a nice 1-2-3 punch of starting pitching. Plus there’s just not much worthy competition elsewhere in the division. AK Imagine the AL Central was a powerhouse of a division? You’d have to have a pretty good imagination. This is the Twins division and their formula is simple: keep their stars like Carlos Correa and Byron Buxton healthy and pitch a little better than last season. They should squeeze out 90 wins, play a few postseason games and then go golfing. DL The Twins won the division last season with a very lukewarm Correa, at least in the regular season. But this year he steps it up, stays healthy, and powers the division’s most explosive offense. The Twins have impressive depth as well but admittedly this is largely a default pick. MJ This remains the weakest division in baseball and the Twins should return to the playoffs after being knocked out in last year’s American League Division Series. The brightest potential star is third baseman Royce Lewis, a former top overall pick who has battled injuries throughout his brief career, but enjoyed an outstanding finish to the 2023 season that included four grand slams. GB The Rangers are the defending world champions, but this division belongs to the Astros until further notice. Houston’s stalwart veteran bats will be enough to take the division crown for a fourth year in a row, and Yordan Álvarez could be the best hitter in the world. AK The Mariners have some of the best pitchers around, but unfortunately, management wouldn’t give the offense the extra ammunition it needs this offseason to take that step up. The AL West is a tough neighborhood, home to the last two World Series champs, and Seattle isn’t going to fend off Houston and Texas without some additional investment. And that’s a shame, with George Kirby, Luis Castillo and of course, Julio Rodriguez, the core is there. Texas and Houston both have rotation health problems, and who gets healthiest the fastest will dictate the winner. I’m going with the reigning World Series champs, the Rangers, with Jacob deGrom back in August to hammer down the ‘Stros. DL Expect a nailbiter to the finish once again but Houston takes the division thanks to their strong top-to-bottom lineup. The offensive stars have mostly remained, the addition of Josh Hader is a plus, and none of the other AL West retooled enough to usurp the Astros. MJ The Rangers won last year’s World Series, but Houston still have the best team for a 162-game season. The addition of the flamethrowing Hader to an already dominant bullpen will make them exceptionally tough to beat in the late innings. GB The Braves have built a machine, and it should keep churning out division titles. Ronald Acuña Jr is the best baseball player breathing right now, the lineup around him is deep, and nobody has a clearly better pitching duo than Atlanta do in Spencer Strider and Max Fried. AK Clear two-horse race, and one of those horses has a limp. OK, maybe that’s a tad rude to say about a Phillies team that should’ve played World Series baseball last October, but there’s just no way any team in that NL East can compete with Alex Anthopoulos’s machine in Atlanta, at least in the regular season. The Braves have the deepest offense in MLB and while the rotation has some health question marks, Atlanta should win their seventh straight division title. DL Atlanta have arguably the most impressive top to bottom roster in baseball. They have two Cy Young candidates in their rotation, they fortified their bullpen in the offseason, and have some dude named Ronald Acuna Jr. The bigger question is whether the Braves can shake the monkey off their back against the Phillies in the playoffs when/if they meet again. MJ It won’t be easy in a division with the star-studded Phillies and lingering Mets, but the Braves are the only team whose talent is comparable with the Dodgers. Not only did they feature last year’s NL MVP (Acuña), they also had the fourth-place finisher (Matt Olson) and the fourth-place finisher for the NL Cy Young Award (Spencer Strider). GB Nobody has reached out to grab the Central with offseason moves, but the Cubs are best positioned after re-signing center field-first base hybrid Cody Bellinger. The team’s offensive supporting cast of Ian Happ, Seiya Suzuki, and Nico Hoerner should be enough to beat the field. AK How many wins will it take to win the NL Central: 84, 85? Who can win? Absolutely anyone can win the most wide open division in baseball, even the lowly Buccos. More realistically, the favorites are the retooled Cubs and the humiliated Cardinals, who need to bounce back from the rarest of season busts in 2023. Chicago brought in Brewers skipper Craig Counsell to prove they were legitimately trying. Re-signing Bellinger while inking pitchers Shōta Imanaga and Héctor Neris also showed their intent. The Cards are old with too many question marks. The Brewers are fading. Cubs win. DL The Brewers and Cardinals will put up a valiant fight but the Cubs will eke out a division title. Don’t expect much more than 90 wins, though. Counsell is skilled at taking teams to the postseason. But will they ultimately be sunk by the lack of a megastar? MJ The Reds have endured a cursed spring that saw them lose a bright prospect to a PED suspension (infielder Noelvi Marte) and top hitter to shoulder surgery (infielder Matt McClain). Still, they feature one of the game’s most electrifying young talents in shortstop Elly De La Cruz (who hit 13 homers and stole 35 bases in just 98 games last year) and a budding star in power-hitting first baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand, who will be an unlikely contender to lead the National League in home runs. GB The Dodgers will win this division, just as surely as there will be good weather, delicious Korean food, and tons of traffic in Los Angeles. There is no need to keep up a false pretense that anybody else has a chance to finish ahead of a team this complete. AK How about being NL champions and having basically no shot at winning the West. That’s life for the Diamondbacks, who shocked the Phillies in the NLCS to make the World Series. The battle for second place also includes the Padres, who dealt Soto and lost Blake Snell, and the Giants, who have Snell in hand, new 3B Matt Chapman, and a rehabbing Robbie Ray. San Francisco spent big: now if they only still had Bruce Bochy in their dugout. And yes: the Dodgers will cruise to yet another division title. DL Easy call or easiest call? Sure, it may not be wise to bet on the level of distraction the Ohtani scandal will bring throughout the season. It matters little when considering wins and losses, though. The Dodgers have five-to-six perennial All-Stars without Ohtani. They’ll be just fine. MJ Freddie Freeman, Betts and Ohtani are three of the very best hitters in all of Major League Baseball. Barring injury, the starting pitching staff will have four star arms by the summertime. This division is excellent, but nobody catches the Dodgers over 162 games. GB Rangers, Orioles, Yankees. AK Astros, Yankees, Blue Jays. DL Mariners, Rangers, Yankees. MJ Rays, Rangers, Blue Jays. GB Phillies, Giants, Brewers. AK Phillies, Giants, Padres. DL Phillies, Padres, Diamondbacks. MJ Padres, Phillies, Mets. GB Astros over Yankees. AK Orioles over Astros. DL Orioles over Yankees. MJ Astros over Orioles. GB Braves over Dodgers. AK Braves over Dodgers. DL Braves over Cubs. DL Dodgers over Braves. GB Braves over Astros. The Dodgers are the best team in baseball, but the Braves will have a more enticing set of starting pitchers for a best-of-seven series (particularly because Ohtani will not be ready to pitch again until 2025). Atlanta’s repertoire will be enough to conquer an elite but inevitably aging Astros team for the second time in four years. AK Braves over Orioles. The Braves, 104 wins in the books last season, were ousted by a good Phillies team, who were beaten by a worse Diamondbacks team. Nothing, it seems, can stop baseball’s postseason crapshoot carousel from spinning undeserving teams into places they shouldn’t be. Except this season, Atlanta won’t play the victim, instead, sticking it to LA, making Freddie Freeman wish he never left home. They’ll face a young, cheap and extremely cheerful Orioles team, with a flurry of young stars that will have overperformed two years running, ousting the Yankees in the process. The kids are alright, but nothing like Atlanta and their meticulously built roster, with a pitching rotation bolstered at the deadline. It will be their second title in four seasons. Bravo. DL Orioles over Braves. This time the Braves prevail over their playoff nemesis in Philadelphia to make the World Series. The lineup is just too powerful top-to-bottom. But the Orioles are poised to win it all. Last regular season was no fluke, more a glimpse into the Orioles’ future. The young players gained a valuable year of experience, and an already strong pitching staff got a stud in Burnes. MJ Dodgers over Astros. I am blandly choosing what I believe to be the two most talented teams to win the pennant (and the four most talented teams to reach the championship series) and reverse the trend of the best teams suffering early playoff exits. Los Angeles will likely need to acquire a shortstop and one more starting pitcher at some point during the season, but their biggest foe will be the pressure they’ll meet as soon as October begins. Nothing seems to faze the Astros, who are still enjoying excellent play from reliable stars Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Ultimately, I think the Dodgers edge the Astros by exploiting a starting pitching advantage and avoiding Houston’s devastating bullpen.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,676,Ohtani representatives refuse to give evidence they reported alleged theft,"Unanswered questions remain over allegations Shohei Ohtani’s former interpreter stole millions from the baseball star after his representatives declined to give further details to ESPN. Ippei Mizuhara is accused of wiring huge sums from Ohtani’s accounts to cover his debts with an illegal California bookmaker, a claim the player repeated in a press conference on Monday. Ohtani’s representatives said last week that “we are turning the matter over to the authorities”. However, they have repeatedly declined to say which authorities they have reported the alleged theft to. When ESPN asked for proof of any criminal report on Tuesday, Ohtani’s representatives again declined to comment. The agencies likely to investigate any allegations around Mizuhara did not confirm to ESPN that they had received any report from Ohtani’s representatives. The Department of Homeland Security said it was working with the IRS to look into Mizuhara, but did not say whether that was connected to the alleged theft. It also did not confirm whether it had been contacted by the Ohtani camp. The IRS has previously told ESPN that it is investigating Mizuhara and California bookmaker Mathew Bowyer, but did not say whether it had been contacted by Ohtani’s representatives. Betting is legal in most US states but not in California. Mizuhara initially said Ohtani had given him money to pay off his gambling debts. However, Ohtani’s lawyers then said Ohtani had been a victim of “massive theft” orchestrated by Mizuhara. In a subsequent interview with ESPN, Mizuhara said he had lied in his initial statement and that Ohtani knew nothing about the gambling debts. Mizuhara, who had been a close friend of Ohtani, was fired as his interpreter. “Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has told lies,” Ohtani said on Monday. Mizuhara said last week that Ohtani did not place any bets himself. “I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting,” he said. MLB players face lifetime bans if they bet on their own teams. The story has overshadowed MLB as it prepares for Opening Day on Thursday. Ohtani is baseball’s biggest star, and one of the most famous people in his native Japan. Ohtani joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal, and MLB expected the storyline of the season to be around one of the most talented baseball players in history joining one of the sport’s most famous clubs. However, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said on Tuesday that he believes Mizuhara’s departure will help Ohtani bond with his new team. “Actually, I would argue that it’s going to help relations internally,” Roberts said. “Because there’s no longer a buffer. I think that I’ve already seen it the last couple of days. I think Shohei has been even more engaging with his teammates, and I think there’s only upside with that.” Roberts added that he was glad Ohtani addressed the media on Monday. “I think [Monday] was a big day, and we’re all looking forward to moving forward,” Roberts said. “But I do think it’s an opportunity for us to really support him from everywhere.” Ohtani has gone 0 for 6 in three exhibition games since returning from the Dodgers’ recent trip to South Korea.",2024-03-27 12:15:37,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/27/shohei-ohtani-ippei-mizuhara-theft-allegations-wire-police-report-baseball,The Guardian,676,unanswered remain former interpreter stole million baseball star declined give accused wiring huge cover illegal bookmaker claim player repeated press conference said last week turning matter however repeatedly declined say theft proof criminal report declined comment likely investigate around confirm received report department homeland security said working look say whether connected theft also confirm whether camp previously told investigating bookmaker bowyer say whether betting legal u initially said given money pay gambling however said victim massive theft subsequent interview said lied initial statement knew nothing gambling close friend fired interpreter stealing money account told said said last week place want everyone know zero involvement betting said face lifetime bet story opening day biggest star one famous people native japan 10year 700m deal season around one talented baseball history joining one sport famous however manager said departure help bond new team actually would argue going help internally said there longer buffer think already seen last couple day think even engaging think there upside added glad medium think big day looking forward moving forward said think opportunity u really support everywhere gone 0 6 three exhibition since recent trip south korea refuse give evidence theft
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,677,India left reeling by Afghanistan as World Cup hopes begin to fade again,"Perhaps the one positive for India from their shock 2-1 home defeat by Afghanistan in 2026 World Cup qualification is that the team have risen far enough for shock defeats to be a thing. It is not much of a comfort, however, and once solid-looking dreams of reaching the final stages on the road to the World Cup for the first time are starting to hang by delicate threads of Assam silk. On Thursday, fans in that state’s biggest city, Guwahati, were confident of a comfortable win against Afghanistan, a team ranked 158 in the world. The 0-0 draw between the two five days earlier in the south-west corner of Saudi Arabia, rather than in Kabul, was surely a blip. Qatar were streaking ahead in Group A of qualification, leaving India and Kuwait to fight for the second spot that also brings a place in the final 18 that will fight it out for Asia’s increased World Cup allocation of eight. India had four points from the first three games and could have moved four points clear of third with two games to go. That seemed to be on the cards when the third-highest active men’s international goalscorer, Sunil Chhetri, netted No 94 (12 behind Lionel Messi and 34 behind Cristiano Ronaldo) in the first half. With 20 minutes left, however, Rahmat Akbari equalised and just before the end Sharif Mukhammad scored an already famous winner. It was a stunning result. India are still second but instead of being almost home and dry they are level on points with Afghanistan and one ahead of Kuwait and still have Qatar still to play. Anything could happen in the remaining games in June. Fans gathered outside the stadium to boo as the team headed to the bus and chants of “Stimac out” could be heard. Igor Stimac’s job is on the line. The former Derby and West Ham centre-back was already on the defensive after last year’s rumours – angrily denied – that he consulted astrologers when selecting the team and, more importantly, a poor Asian Cup. India arrived at the tournament in January with high hopes but left Qatar without scoring a goal. The Blue Tigers broke into the top 100 of Fifa’s rankings last summer but they have since slipped to 117. The team are reliant on the soon-to-be-40 Chhetri in attack and fans feel their Croatian coach does not take enough responsibility for setbacks. After the loss, Stimac said he did just that, but then talked of a lack of intensity from his players, too many mistakes and a need to improve fitness levels. It is a measure of the progress made that missing out on the last 18 of qualification would be regarded as a major failure but Stimac needs to prove wrong an increasing number of fans who feel he has taken the team as far as he can in the past five years. Afghanistan’s coach, Ashley Westwood, has inserted himself into any conversation if Stimac leaves. The former Sheffield Wednesday defender won two Indian league titles in 2014 and 2016 with Bengaluru, a new team. After leaving for Malaysia to take over underperforming Penang, he probably tried to change too much too quickly and it did not work out. Now, though, he has reminded people what he can do after five months with Afghanistan. It is a challenging job. The Aghanistan national team are not able to play games at home. Much of the squad is made up of players who left the country at a young age to settle in Europe. “We’ve worked really hard over the last 14 days, we’ve had some incredible travel,” said a delighted Westwood, who claimed the Lions of Khorasan should also have won the first meeting between the two. “Players, staff from 16, 17 different countries coming together, it has been difficult. We’ve had 350 flights to organise; it’s a logistical nightmare.” Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion Stimac would welcome that problem. He and the federation have asked the India government to allow players of Indian origin who were born and raised in Europe and elsewhere to Indian parents to be granted dual nationality so they can be called up. It has yet to happen. China’s new coach, Branko Ivankovic, another Croatian, called up the naturalised Brazilians Elkeson and Fernandinho for his first two games, both against Singapore. The first was a disaster as Team Dragon, who also failed to score at the Asian Cup, let slip a two-goal lead to draw 2-2. For an hour of the return in Tianjin, it was looking dicey at 1-1 before three late goals provided a vital China win. It prevented more negative headlines on the day Chen Xuyuan, former head of the China Football Association, had been jailed for life on corruption charges. He joins in prison a number of other high-ranking officials as well as the former national team coach, and Everton player, Li Tie. China got out of jail late against Singapore but failure to beat Thailand on 6 June may result in the team needing to get something against their international kryptonite, South Korea, in Seoul.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,678,Extreme heat summit to urge leaders to act on threat from rising temperatures,"Two of the world’s biggest aid agencies will host an inaugural global summit on extreme heat on Thursday as directors warn that the climate crisis is dramatically increasing the probability of a mass-fatality heat disaster. The conference will highlight some of the pioneering work being done, from tree-planting projects to the development of reflective roof coverings that reduce indoor temperatures. After last year’s record-shattering temperatures, when 3.8 billion people – half the world’s population – sweltered in extreme heat for at least one day, the organisers hope the event will prompt governments to prepare for a “silent killer” that rarely gets the attention it deserves when compared with hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) have come together to stage this virtual conference, in which they will urge national governments, local authorities, humanitarian groups, companies, school and hospitals to develop heat action plans. They will float the idea of naming heatwaves in the same way that typhoons or hurricanes are labelled to make them more prominent. Jagan Chapagain, the IFRC secretary general, drew comparisons to Kim Stanley Robinson’s apocalyptic novel Ministry for the Future, which opens with a deadly heatwave in India that kills millions of people, some of whom are poached alive in a lake they hoped to cool off in. “It is, for now, science fiction,” he said. “We’re not there, yet. But extreme heat, far less visually dramatic than hurricanes or floods, is claiming lives and livelihoods with a stealth which belies its impact. Climate change is dramatically increasing the probability that we will see a mass-fatality extreme heat disaster soon.” Chapagan said heat was already a major cause of suffering in many parts of the world. In the US it accounts for more deaths than all other climate impacts put together, but this often goes unreported because it is usually less sudden, less visual, than events such as hurricanes, and the scale of fatalities can take months or years to calculate. These types of disaster are starting to appear on the IFRC radar. The organisation’s 40-year-old Disaster Response Emergency Fund received its first appeal for a heatwave in 2018, from North Korea. The next came in 2021 from Vietnam, then two the following year (Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan), followed by three last year (Greece, Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan). In that period, the amount the fund provided to heatwave appeals rose more than fivefold. While the sums are still relatively small compared with more traditional humanitarian responses for earthquakes and cyclone disasters, heatwave risks are projected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. The death toll from heat-related illnesses is forecast to soar more than fourfold by midcentury if temperatures rise by 2C, according to a recent study in the Lancet. A separate study predicted that China alone is on track to see between 20,000 and 80,000 heatwave deaths a year. One of the primary goals of the heat summit is to improve data collection, which is currently done on a piecemeal basis, often using different standards from country to country. Last year, France estimated it had 5,000 heat-related deaths, Germany 3,000 and the UK 2,295. Yet far more populous countries in Asia reported much lower tolls, despite higher temperatures and lower public investment in healthcare. India registered 179 heat-related deaths, Pakistan 22 and Malaysia and Thailand two each. A higgledy piggledy approach has led to some strange statistical anomalies. According to the World Health Organization, there were 166,000 deaths due to heatwaves between 1998 and 2017, about half of which were in Europe, despite the fact that Europe has less than a tenth of the world population, some of the best healthcare systems and relatively low average temperatures. In reality, there is no doubt that the most heat-vulnerable people live in poorer, hotter countries. Most at risk are the elderly, sick and those who work outside or live in poorly-ventilated homes without air conditioning. This week’s summit aims to draw more attention to their plight and to best practice in disaster alerts and response. In many cases, cities are leading the way. Freetown in Sierra Leone is one of the pioneers. Its mayor, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, who will speak at this week’s summit, has appointed a heat officer to draw up and administer an action plan. This includes heatmapping the city to identify the highest-risk areas, sending out temperature forecasts by WhatsApp groups, the installation of shades over outdoor markets and the creation of 24 “cool corridors” by 2030 through a tree planting campaign. The city is also hosting a pilot programme in the shantytowns where 45% of the population live, coating corrugated iron roofs with a mirrored film that can reflect the sun’s energy away from the building below. Initial tests suggest this can reduce temperatures inside by as much as 6C. This work has not always been easy. The market shades were ripped away in fierce storms and have to be replaced with a more durable material. Funding has also been difficult, but Aki-Sawyerr said residents were happy to have more protection from the heat. “We have to be innovative. Many of these things haven’t been done before,” she said. Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in other countries are also putting more effort into heatwave preparedness. Before a recent heatwave in Hanoi, volunteers parked mobile “cooling buses” – offering air conditioning, cool water and a shaded place to sit – in areas frequented by street vendors, motorcycle riders and other outdoor workers. In Nepal, where temperatures in the southern lowlands often exceed 45C and humidity can be high, volunteers are encouraging meteorologists to improve early warning systems, municipalities to create “cool shelters” in the hottest areas, and hospitals to prepare for the health impacts during periods of high temperatures. Educational establishments are a particular focus. Last year, authorities in the Terai region, which is usually the hottest in the country, closed schools for several days so children would not have to walk outside during a heatwave. “The youth understand the issues. We are trying to mobilise them and encourage each school and campus to have a heat action plan,” said Sagar Shrestha, the director of disaster management at the Nepal Red Cross Society. Among the speakers at the heat summit will be John Podesta, who was recently appointed as the top US climate diplomat, replacing John Kerry. The meeting will launch an online “extreme heat global action centre” where local leaders and governments can share tips on how to improve the resilience of cities, companies and communities. It will also kick off a two-month global campaign to raise awareness, culminating in a Heat Action Day on 2 June. In future, the IFRC aims to put in place heatwave disaster kits, prevention plans and rapid response guidelines such as those it now has for other disasters. “We are not there yet,” Chapagain said. “We don’t have the standardised response that we have for other crises. This is an area where the humanitarian community hasn’t paid enough attention.” But he expressed confidence that preparedness would improve. Referring back to the horrors described in Ministry for the Future, he said: “Science fiction is deliberately scary. Reality need not be. With the right anticipation and action, the very worst scenarios can remain in the realm of imagination.”",2024-03-27 11:37:19,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/extreme-heat-summit-to-urge-leaders-to-act-on-threat-from-rising-temperatures,The Guardian,678,two biggest aid host inaugural global summit extreme heat warn climate crisis dramatically increasing probability heat disaster conference highlight work done development reflective roof reduce indoor last 38 billion people half population extreme heat least one day hope event prompt prepare silent killer rarely attention international federation red cross red crescent united agency international development come together stage virtual conference urge national local humanitarian school develop heat action float idea naming way make prominent secretary general drew kim apocalyptic novel ministry future deadly million people alive lake hoped cool science fiction said yet extreme heat far le visually dramatic stealth impact climate change dramatically increasing probability see extreme heat disaster soon said heat already major cause suffering many world u climate put together often go unreported usually le sudden le visual scale take calculate disaster starting appear radar 40yearold disaster response emergency fund received first appeal 2018 north korea next came 2021 two following year three last year period amount fund provided rose fivefold still relatively small traditional humanitarian cyclone increase rapidly coming death toll forecast soar fourfold rise 2c according recent study lancet separate study china alone track see 20000 80000 year one primary heat summit improve data collection currently done piecemeal basis often different country country last year 5000 3000 2295 yet far populous much lower despite higher lower public investment registered 179 22 two approach led strange statistical according world health organization 166000 due 1998 2017 half despite fact le tenth world population best relatively low average reality doubt people live hotter risk elderly sick work outside live without air summit draw attention plight best practice disaster response many leading way sierra one mayor speak summit heat officer draw administer action plan city identify sending temperature installation outdoor creation 24 cool 2030 tree planting campaign city also hosting pilot 45 population live coating corrugated iron mirrored film reflect energy away building initial suggest reduce inside much 6c work always easy market away fierce durable material also difficult said happy protection heat innovative many havent done said sign earth important get environment news good bad essential newsletter promotion red cross red crescent also effort preparedness recent mobile cooling offering air cool water shaded place sit street motorcycle outdoor southern often exceed 45c humidity high encouraging improve early warning create cool prepare health high educational particular focus last year region usually country closed several day would walk outside youth understand trying encourage school campus heat action plan said director disaster management red cross society among heat summit podesta recently top u climate diplomat kerry meeting launch extreme heat global action local share improve resilience also kick global campaign raise awareness heat action day 2 june future put place disaster prevention rapid response yet said dont response crisis area humanitarian community enough attention expressed confidence preparedness would improve back ministry future said science fiction deliberately scary reality need right anticipation action worst remain realm imagination extreme heat summit urge act threat rising
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,679,Jen didn’t fit the profile for a heart attack – then she had three of them,"At just 36, Jen O’Neill was not considered an emergency department priority for treatment for a suspected heart attack. O’Neill, who had given birth 11 months previously, had none of the traditional precursors for a heart attack – no family history, no high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol levels – but her troponin levels confirmed the problem was in her heart. When she was finally taken for a scan, she received a diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection, which occurs when there is a tear in the artery that supplies blood to the heart. More than nine out of 10 Scad cases are women, often soon after they have a baby. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But with no research into the best course of medication for the condition, O’Neill was given the same course of blood thinners and beta blockers used for more traditional heart attack patients. The blood thinners made her periods extremely heavy and gave her awful fatigue. They were also meant to prevent further heart attacks. But O’Neill went on to suffer another two. “We don’t have kind of a gold standard treatment of Scad … because my understanding is a lot of the research is based on males, because they are the traditional heart attack patients,” O’Neill said. Now, a new national research centre will be dedicated to improving the lack of knowledge about how sex and gender affects the risk, detection and treatment of many health conditions – and translating that research into policies and practice. The Centre for Sex and Gender Equity in Health and Medicine will launch on Wednesday at the University of New South Wales, an initiative of the George Institute for Global Health, the Australian Human Rights Institute at the University of New South Wales, and Deakin University, with support from the Victorian Department of Health and the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. Prof Robyn Norton, the founding director of the George Institute, said: “Our knowledge about health has overwhelmingly come from studies done with male cells, male animals, male humans used as standard in the laboratory, and that’s got to change.” Norton said she and her colleagues had realised Australia was “really quite behind” other countries such as Canada, US, Japan, Korea and many European countries who had established centres focused on trying to understand the role of sex and gender on health equity. The evidence base underpinning healthcare was one of the five domains identified to describe gender bias in healthcare in a report released this month by the National Women’s Health Advisory Council, formed in late 2022 to address medical misogyny and chaired by the assistant minister for health, Ged Kearney. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Through research and advocacy, the new centre will address gender bias in health and medicine that leads to poorer health outcomes, evidence gaps and inefficient health spending for women, intersex people, trans and gender-diverse people, and in some cases also men. For example, the data for osteoporosis – which is viewed predominately as a disease of older women – shows that men are rarely treated for the condition and have a higher mortality rate than women from its complications. “There’s an opportunity we hope with the centre to really look at improving health outcomes and health equity, frankly, for all Australians,” Norton said. The centre will have two hubs – one based at UNSW and another at Deakin. Researchers at both universities will be engaged in studies addressing inequities in health but the centre will also serve as a resource for outside organisations and individuals around the country. Norton said the centre would also focus on the translation of research findings into policy and practice, through working with governments, healthcare providers and the business community.",2024-03-26 22:00:33,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/27/jen-didnt-fit-the-profile-for-a-heart-attack-then-she-had-three-of-them,The Guardian,679,36 considered emergency department priority treatment suspected heart attack given birth 11 previously none traditional heart attack family history high blood pressure diabetes high cholesterol confirmed problem heart finally taken scan received diagnosis spontaneous coronary artery dissection tear artery blood heart nine 10 scad often soon baby sign guardian free morning afternoon daily news roundup research best course medication condition given course blood beta used traditional heart attack blood made extremely heavy gave awful fatigue also meant prevent heart went suffer another two dont kind gold standard treatment scad … understanding lot research based traditional heart attack said new national research improving lack knowledge sex gender risk detection treatment many health research practice sex gender equity health medicine launch university new south initiative institute global health human institute university new south university support department health association medical research prof founding director institute said knowledge health overwhelmingly come done male male male used standard laboratory thats got change said really quite behind canada u japan korea many established trying understand role sex gender health equity evidence base underpinning one five describe gender bias report month national health advisory council formed late 2022 address medical misogyny assistant minister health ged sign afternoon update afternoon update key day telling whats happening newsletter promotion research advocacy new address gender bias health medicine health evidence inefficient health spending intersex people people also men example data osteoporosis predominately disease older men rarely condition higher mortality rate there opportunity hope really look improving health health equity frankly said two one based another engaged health also serve resource outside around country said would also focus translation research policy practice working business community didnt fit profile heart attack three
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,680,Foreign Office summons senior Chinese diplomat over ‘malicious cyber activity’,"Ministers summoned a senior Chinese diplomat to the Foreign Office on Tuesday after accusing Beijing-backed hackers of a cyber-attack on the British elections watchdog and a surveillance operation on politicians. The department called in China’s chargé d’affaires and told him the UK would not tolerate “threatening” cyber-attacks. An FCDO spokesperson said the ministry had “set out the government’s unequivocal condemnation of Chinese state-affiliated organisations and individuals undertaking malicious cyber activity against UK democratic institutions and parliamentarians”. “The UK government would not tolerate such threatening activity, and would continue to take strong action with partners across the globe to respond,” they said. The summons came after the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, announced sanctions on Monday on a company and two individuals accused of involvement in China’s malicious cyber activity. But ministers faced criticism from Tory MPs including Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, and Alicia Kearns, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who called the government’s actions “feeble” and “insufficient”. Rishi Sunak defended his approach to China, insisting the UK was “undoubtedly more robust than most of our allies”. MPs on the liaison committee challenged him on the government’s reluctance to act on Chinese-owned companies such as ByteDance, which owns TikTok. The prime minister told MPs the UK had introduced stronger export controls for sensitive technologies and a tougher foreign investment scheme than other countries. “On trade, we are already less dependent on China for trade than Australia, Korea, Japan, the US, Germany and many other countries,” he said. “I am entirely confident that our approach to dealing with the risk that China poses is very much in line with our allies and in most cases goes further in protecting ourselves.” Sunak also cited the government’s decision to remove Huawei equipment from the UK’s telecommunications networks, which Boris Johnson took in 2020 after a major rebellion by Tory backbenchers. Dowden indicated on Tuesday that the government was preparing to put China in the enhanced tier of the government’s new foreign influence registration scheme. This would require organisations or individuals to register with the government if they carry out advocacy or campaigning activities on Beijing’s behalf. The prime minister’s spokesperson said the scheme was “in the process of being finalised and no countries have been specified yet”. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Dowden told MPs on Monday that ministers were “in the process of collective government agreement” on the matter and that “the conduct that I have described today will have a very strong bearing on the decision that we make in respect of it”. Ministers are also under pressure to formally designate China a threat to UK security in the government’s integrated review, which sets out the country’s foreign, defence and security policies. It currently refers to China as an “epoch-defining challenge”. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, told Times Radio that China was “obviously a security threat”. There are differing views in government about how robust an approach to take against China, which is one of the UK’s biggest trading partners.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,681,Censor those trousers! How Alan Titchmarsh’s legs became TV editors’ latest target,"I wonder how Alan Titchmarsh feels today. On the one hand, footage has surfaced of him on North Korean state television, which has been rebroadcasting episodes of his BBC series Garden Secrets since at least 2022. On the other, the North Korean government seems to hate him. Well, part of him. Not only have the North Koreans hacked down each hour-long episode to just 15 minutes, drowning out his speaking voice with a mixture of voiceover and instrumental music in the process, but they have also shamed his legs. Thanks to a government ruling that decries denim jeans as a sign of evil American imperialism, Titchmarsh’s legs are blurred out whenever they are on screen. The effect is that Titchmarsh appears as a benign hovering wizard. Even this is radical. The website KCNA Watch runs a daily livestream of Korean Central TV. Last Friday’s programming, for instance, was largely devoted to factory tours, sparsely attended football matches and agricultural machinery shows. Compared to output like this, the sight of Titchmarsh gently tending to his borders must come off like that banned Jonathan Glazer advert where the devil sells Flake chocolate. Not that North Korea is the only country that edits foreign media. Two years ago, Manyun Zou, a writer for the website the Pudding, watched 100 episodes of The Big Bang Theory that were broadcast on the Chinese streaming service Youku and noticed that they were riddled with seemingly arbitrary edits. Jokes on the Youku versions were sliced out carelessly, leaving the related canned laughter in place. Meanwhile, there is a Chinese ruling banning TV shows and films that depict time travel, on the basis that it lacks “positive thoughts and meaning” and can “disrespect history”. As such, for a number of years it was impossible to find Doctor Who on Chinese television. Sign up to What's On Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday after newsletter promotion We shouldn’t pretend that such censorship happens only in totalitarian Asian countries. Australia, for instance, has repeatedly banned a particular episode of Peppa Pig. The episode, Mr Skinnylegs, revolves around the young piglets learning that spiders are ultimately harmless visitors in our homes. This is true – if you live in Peppa Pig’s country of origin. If you live in Australia, though, where some spiders can kill you, the episode has a different timbre. Viewed through this lens, Mr Skinnylegs dares children to dice with death. Of course, Britain is no stranger to berserk censorship. As recently as the 1990s, the British government cracked down on anything that could be thought to be peripherally supportive of the IRA, including documentaries and an episode of the US drama Lou Grant. Even more strangely, it banned the voices of Irish republicans and loyalist paramilitaries from being broadcast on television or radio. This led to an absurd workaround where these people could be interviewed, but their voices had to be overdubbed by an actor, lest the sound of Gerry Adams’ speaking voice corrupt our brains. You can imagine that, if Adams had gone on television wearing a particularly Irish-looking pair of trousers, the government would have airbrushed those, too.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,682,Cargo ship that hit Baltimore bridge was involved in Antwerp collision in 2016,"The same vessel that hit the Baltimore Francis Scott Key Bridge on Tuesday, destroying it and sending people and vehicles tumbling into the water, was also involved in a collision while leaving the port of Antwerp, Belgium, in 2016. According to Vessel Finder and the maritime incident archive Shipwrecklog, the Dali – a 948ft (290-meter) cargo ship with a capacity of 10,000 containers – was leaving the container terminal of Antwerp heading to Bremerhaven. As it did so, its bow reportedly swung around, causing the stern to scrape the side of the quay, significantly damaging several meters of the hull. The ship was reportedly detained by authorities afterward and docked in Deurganckdok, Belgium. There were reportedly no injuries or adverse pollution. According to Vessel Finder, the weather was fine at the time, and the incident was reportedly blamed on the ship’s master and pilot on board. A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own. For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes. For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers' Federation. Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account. The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition. Karen McVeigh, senior reporter It is unclear what crew were aboard the ship. Vessel Finder said at the time that the ship, which was built in South Korea in 2015 by Hyundai Heavy Industries, was owned by the Greek company Oceanbulk Maritime but was chartered by Maersk. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) confirmed on Tuesday that the Dali was registered in Singapore and had 22 crew on board, with Maersk adding in a statement that the crew were all Indian but none of them were Maersk crew or personnel. It said the ship was operated by the charter vessel company Synergy Group. Maersk has been approached for comment. About 2.6km (1.6 miles) of the Baltimore bridge collapsed on Tuesday when the Dali crashed into it, causing a number of vehicles to fall into the Patapsco River below. At least seven people were being searched for with two rescued, including one in critical condition, officials said on Tuesday at a pre-dawn press conference.",2024-03-26 12:17:34,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/26/baltimore-bridge-ship-previous-collision-antwerp-2016,The Guardian,682,vessel hit key bridge sending people tumbling water also involved collision leaving port 2016 according vessel finder maritime incident archive dali 948ft 290meter cargo ship capacity 10000 leaving container terminal heading bow reportedly swung around causing stern scrape side quay significantly several hull ship reportedly afterward reportedly adverse pollution according vessel finder weather fine time incident reportedly blamed master pilot board ship flying flag convenience owner registered vessel country ship ensign flag country known flag state typically ship owner advantage arrangement comparatively lower employment thus labour registration lower crew tend towards lower working little protection opposed international transport federation panama ship registry globally open registry foreign register flag anonymity making difficult account practice 1920s u cruise registered panama could serve alcohol prohibition senior reporter unclear crew aboard ship vessel finder said time ship built south korea 2015 heavy company maritime chartered maritime port authority confirmed dali registered 22 crew board statement crew none crew personnel said ship charter vessel company synergy group comment 26km 16 bridge dali causing number fall river least seven people two one critical condition said predawn press conference cargo ship hit bridge involved collision 2016
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,683,Australia 5-0 Lebanon: World Cup 2026 qualifier – as it happened,"Joey Lynch has filed from the GIO Stadium, so it’s time to wrap up tonight’s blog. Thanks for your company and emails, bye! “A clinic in Canberra”. That’s how the Socceroos’ social media account has described tonight’s game. I wouldn’t go quite that far but it was one of the better attacking performances of the last couple of years, with some exciting glimpses of the future. A record crowd of 25,023 should go home sated. 2 min Kusini Yengi scored his first international goal from a magnificent Craig Goodwin cross 47 min Bassel Jradi scored an unfortunate own goal after Harry Souttar’s header was saved 48 min Goodwin waved a superb third from the edge of the area 68 min The debutant Patrick Yazbek made a first international goal for John Iredale, who had just come on 81 min Goodwin tapped in his second after good play from Iredale on the right. The state of play in Group I Australia P4 Pts 12 Palestine P3 Pts 4 Lebanon P4 Pts 2 Bangladesh P3 Pts 1 It’s currenetly goalless between Bangladesh and Palestine after an hour. John Iredale’s reaction It means the world to me personally, and to the boys. We set out to score more goals tonight and we’re pleased we did that. It’s really special when you come from the same youth team [as Patrick Yazbek] to share a goal and assist. As soon as I saw him charging down the left I knew I had to get in the box. Craig Goodwin’s got an unbelievable left foot, and having him in the squad really boosts our quality. I was really pleased to help him get his second goal. A first #Socceroos goal in just his second cap 🇦🇺👊@john_iredale9 ⚽🥅🎥 @10FootballAU #LBNvAUS #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/lkxeIFiNJW “From the snippets I’ve seen that was pretty prosaic...” says Chris Paraskevas. “You can feel Arnie’s grip on the job loosening post Asian Cup. His body language is more tetchy than usual. Something isn’t quite right at the moment, a sense that things have become unsettled.“Fine margins. I really think his tenure will be defined by a 15-minute spell against Korea (and possibly a more positive 15-minute spell against Argentina. As much as this is a PR boost and a ‘good night’ for Football Australia... it’s not enough to start turning the tide of public opinion.” I wonder whether football fans expect more/too much these days, or whether we are just more exposed to complaints. I’ve no idea. But given that watching sport is something we love, we do spent an awful lot of time in a state of dissatisfaction. I don’t say that critically by the way; I’ve been a horribly entitled brat in the past. The Socceroos are into the third round of World Cup qualification with a couple of games to spare. An emphatic win over Lebanon was a celebration of both the present and future. Craig Goodwin flaunted his educated left foot, making the first goal and scoring two – the first a beauty – in the second half. There were also first international goals for Kusini Yengi and John Iredale, as well as assists for Iredale and the debutant Patrick Yazbek. All in all, it was a good night for Graham Arnold.

This one definitely isn’t timewasting. 90 min There will be five added minutes. To what end, we know not. 89 min Look, there’s nothing to report, just a lot of dead time since the fifth goal. 87 min Australia’s record in the second round of qualification now reads P4 W4 D0 L0 F15 A0. Truly, we’ve seen worse. 86 min: Lebanon substitution Jackson Khoury, who was born in New South Wales, comes on for Bassel Jradi. 82 min: Australia substitutions Sammy Silvera and Thomas Deng come on for Mitch Duke and Gethin Jones. The celebration of Craig Goodwin continues with his second goal of the night. Jones played a simple ball down the right to Iredale, who made a nice run into space and crossed low into the middle. Shour, stretching towards his own goal, could only divert the ball across the six-yard box to Goodwin. The rest was a formality. 79 min: Lebanon substitution An unhappy Omar Bugiel is replaced by Hasan Srour. 79 min Here’s that sweet hit from Craig Goodwin that put Australia 3-0 up just after half-time.

What they need now is for Bangladesh to take points off Palestine in the other game; it’s 0-0 at half-time. John Iredale, who only came on 90 seconds ago, has scored his first international goal. The debutant Patrick Yazbek charged down the left, away from a slightly woolly challenge by Khamis, and curled a superb low cross on the run. Iredale sped away from Sharafeddine at the far post and swept the ball into the empty net. How’s that for an instant impact? 66 min: Double substitution for Australia John Iredale and the debutant Josh Nisbet replace Kusini Yengi, who will remember this night for many a decade, and Connor Metcalfe. Khalil Khamis was booked just before that, I think for dissent. Cap number #642 🟢🟡Josh Nisbet is a #Socceroo#LBNvAUS #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/QDPvbD4U4l 64 min Metcalfe plays in the overlapping Jones, whose cross is headed over from eight yards by Duke. It was slightly too high. Just before that, there was an appeal for a penalty when the ball hit Bitar’s hand. It deflected off his chest, though, so it was the correct decision. 62 min It’s been fairly subdued since that third goal, with both sides knowing that the game is over barring a comeback for the books. 60 min “The game will take care of itself,” says Martin Turnbull, “but a bit of a bugbear of mine – Arnold with his hand over the heart during the anthem. Might be getting long in the tooth but despise creeping Americanisms. Teams going on o-fence and d-fence, which is also happening in the footy. Anyway, let’s get five.” I can’t speak for Graham Arnold but I do wonder how often gestures like that are a sad (I use that word in the truest sense, while looking in the mirror) attempt to embrace a modern world that the person doesn’t truly understand. I’m not looking forward to growing old and doddery in a post-empathy world. 59 min: Lebanon substitution What, another one? Yep, Gabriel Bitar for Ali Tniech. 58 min: Substitution for Lebanon Karim Darwich replaces the excellent Hassan Maatouk, who at 36 can’t always do the full 90 minutes. 55 min: Socceroos substitution Patrick Yazbek, a 21-year-old of Lebanese descent, replaces Ajdin Hrustic. Congratulations to Patrick Yazbek who becomes cap number 641 👏#LBNvAUS #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/ZlU9A3LQod 54 min The more replays you see, the more you realise Tniech should have been sent off for that tackle on Hrustic. It was born of frustration rather than malevolence but it was still dangerous. And it has done a lot of damage: Hrustic is being helped off by two physios, moving very gingerly. Waved away but he's being carried off by the trainers, unable to support his own weight on his left leg. #LBNvAUS https://t.co/T5AUkmBCwA 53 min That was a poor challenge, with Tniech’s studs plunging into Hrustic’s calf, and he is still down. Patrick Yazbek is preparing to come on for his Socceroos debut. 51 min Tniech is booked for taking out Hrustic in frustration after losing the ball. 51 min: Matar hits the bar! Crikey, it’s all happening. Nader Matar runs onto a loose ball 25 yards out and hits an instant, almost angry shot that beats Ryan and clatters off the bar. Australia broke four on three, with Hrustic on the ball. He scooped it across to Goodwin,18 yards out to the left of centre. He chested the ball and hit the sweetest strike back across Matar into the far corner. Goodwin’s left foot is one big sweet spot tonight. Craig Goodwin is having a helluva night out – he has just scored a beauty to make it 3-0. Goodwin’s big, in-swinging free-kick from the right was met inevitably by Souttar. His downward header was well saved by Matar, diving to his right, but the ball hit Jradi and rebounded miserably into the net. The Socceroos scored in the second minute of the first half; they’ve done it again at the start of the second. 46 min Lajud is booked within 30 seconds of coming on. He pulled back Mitch Duke, who was breaking dangerously down the right. 46 min Lebanon get the second half under way. Half-time substitution Lebanon are bringing on Daniel Lajud, so impressive as substitute on Thursday, for Hassan Chaitou. Half-time reading This is terrific* piece from Jonathan Liew, who once again won Columnist of the Year at last night’s big Sports Journalists’ Association bash in London. * And slightly dispiriting, because we’ve cocked this human experiment thing up, haven’t we Australia lead in Canberra. The first half was essentially an ode to the left foot of Craig Goodwin. His unplayable cross set up Kusini Yengi’s early goal, Yengi’s first for the Socceroos, and an equally delicious ball was headed against the post by Harry Souttar just before half-time. Lebanon had some promising moments, usually when their captain Hassan Maatouk was on the ball, but Maty Ryan didn’t have a save to make. Australia are in control and heading for the third round of qualification. Made in Adelaide. Converted in Canberra.@yengikusini ⚽🎥 @10FootballAU #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/ZBdoEuEbd2 45+2 min Hrustic is wiped out by the lunging Sharafeddine in the D but the referee gives nothing. That was a clear foul and probably a yellow card. 45 min Four minutes of added time. 43 min: Souttar hits the post! Oof, how has he missed that? Goodwin took a short corner on the left, got it back and teased a gorgeous deep cross with the outside of the left foot. It curved onto the head of Souttar, whose downward header from six yards hit the post. For a goal machine like Souttar, that was a great chance. 42 min Corner to Australia on the right. Goodwin’s delivery is a bit flat and forced away at the near post. Australia regain possession and Hrustic has a shot blocked on the edge of the area. 40' | In the thick of it ⚔️🇱🇧 0-1 🇦🇺#LBNvAUS #Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/xYW6Zl4Vw4 38 min Lebanon win a corner on the right.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,684,Alan Titchmarsh’s jeans blurred by North Korean TV censors,"His calm demeanour and wholesome vocation have apparently endeared him to one of the most authoritarian regimes in the world. But there is something about Alan Titchmarsh that North Korea’s censors can’t quite forgive – his jeans. The green-fingered broadcaster and author of raunchy novels has been a fixture on state television since 2022, albeit with the addition of a blurred effect from the waist down. By wearing jeans to potter about in Britain’s gardens in his BBC TV series Garden Secrets, Titchmarsh, 74, fell foul of a North Korean ban on the garments, which the regime has forbidden since the early 1990s because they are seen as a symbol of US imperialism. In an episode aired on Monday and set in the gardens of the 17th-century Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, Titchmarsh can be seen kneeling in soil, the sleeves of his checked shirt rolled up, plant pots and pruning shears at the ready. His jeans, however, are blurred, though not enough to conceal the fact that he is wearing denim. North Korea’s censors edit to 15 minutes each hour-long episode of the series, which was first shown in the UK in 2010, and mask Titchmarsh’s commentary with North Korean narrators, as well as adding a soundtrack of instrumental music, according to the NK News website. It is, however, just possible to make out the presenter’s dulcet Yorkshire tones in the background. Titchmarsh’s unlikely celebrity in North Korea was noticed in 2022, but media coverage did not pick up on his obscured jeans. “I never imagined that my programmes would reach North Korea, but hopefully the calming nature of British gardening will be well received there,” he said at the time. The censoring of Titchmarsh’s wardrobe is part of a campaign to shield North Koreans from the “malign” influence of western culture that began under the former leader, Kim Jong-il. While his son, the leader Kim Jong-un, has permitted his entourage to use Ford Transit vans and is a fan of NBA basketball, he has warned against allowing “bourgeois culture” and “anti-socialist behaviour” to undermine North Korea’s socialist project. In 2022, the US government-funded Radio Free Asia said the regime was cracking down on “capitalist” fashion and hairstyles, targeting skinny jeans and T-shirts bearing foreign words, as well as dyed or long hair, it said. The clampdown, an unnamed female source in North Korea told the broadcaster, “mainly targets women in their 20s and 30s. If they are caught, they are made to wait on the side of the road until the patrols can finish their crackdown in that area. “Only then will they be taken to the youth league office in the district, where they must write letters confessing their crimes. They must then contact someone at home to bring acceptable clothes for them, and then they are released.” The ban on jeans does not appear to extend to western tourists, who are permitted to dress as they please when they visit the North. It is not clear how, or if, the regime acquired the rights to Garden Secrets. North Korea regularly airs “politically neutral” material from abroad, including sports and science and technology programmes, NK News said, adding that it was likely that the gardening series had been pirated to get around international sanctions imposed in response to the North’s development of nuclear weapons.",2024-03-26 09:04:39,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/26/alan-titchmarsh-jeans-north-korean-tv-censors,The Guardian,684,calm wholesome vocation apparently endeared one authoritarian world something alan north cant quite forgive jean broadcaster author fixture state television since 2022 albeit addition blurred effect waist wearing jean potter series garden 74 fell foul north ban regime forbidden since early 1990s seen symbol u imperialism episode set 17thcentury house seen kneeling soil checked shirt rolled plant pruning shear ready jean however blurred though enough conceal fact wearing denim north edit 15 episode series first shown 2010 mask commentary north well instrumental music according news however possible make dulcet background unlikely celebrity north korea 2022 medium coverage pick jean never would reach north korea hopefully nature gardening well received said time wardrobe part campaign shield north malign influence western culture former leader kim son leader kim permitted entourage use ford transit fan basketball bourgeois culture antisocialist behaviour undermine north socialist project 2022 u radio free said regime cracking capitalist fashion skinny jean bearing foreign well long hair said unnamed female source north korea told broadcaster mainly 20 30 caught made wait side road finish crackdown area taken youth league office district must write confessing must contact someone home bring acceptable clothes ban jean appear extend western permitted dress please visit north clear regime acquired garden north korea regularly politically neutral material abroad sport science technology news said likely gardening series get around international response development nuclear alan jean blurred north
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,685,Tuesday briefing: Why the US and UK are going public with warnings about Chinese hacking,"Good morning. You’re probably not an MP or peer on the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), so that part of yesterday’s cyber-attack revelations needn’t concern you excessively. If you are among the 40 million UK voters included on a register held by the Electoral Commission, though, I have bad news: the Chinese government has your personal details. Yesterday afternoon, deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden laid out sanctions in response to the attacks – in the case of the Electoral Commission hack, more than three years after it happened. In co-ordinated announcements, the US announced sanctions over a years-long campaign involving 10,000 malicious emails sent to politicians, journalists and businesses, and New Zealand said it had raised concerns with Beijing over an attack on its parliament in 2021. Taken together, the announcements represent an attempt to raise the alarm globally about the sheer scale of Chinese hacking – but Beijing is unlikely to be cowed. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Jamie MacColl, a research fellow in cybersecurity at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), about whether these are isolated incidents, or the tip of a digital iceberg. Here are the headlines. Israel-Gaza war | The UN security council has voted to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the first time after the US dropped a threat to veto, bringing Israel to near total isolation on the world stage. Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a planned White House visit by two ministers, while the Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the result a belated “vote for humanity to prevail”. US news | A New York court has handed Donald Trump a lifeline, reducing his $454m bond to $175m over the judgment against him in a huge fraud case. Separately, the judge overseeing the hush-money case against Trump involving the adult film star Stormy Daniels refused to delay the trial, setting a date for jury selection of 15 April. Garrick club | At least four senior judges, Sir Keith Lindblom, Sir Nicholas Cusworth, Sir Nicholas Lavender and Sir Ian Dove, have resigned from the men-only Garrick Club, the Judicial Office has said, as men in the legal profession come under increasing pressure over their close association with an organisation that has repeatedly blocked attempts to allow women to join. US news | Federal agents have raided properties in Los Angeles, Miami and New York that local news outlets have reported are tied to rapper and mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs. US media reported that the searches were part of a sex trafficking investigation, though the exact reason for the raids remained unclear. Conservatives | Rishi Sunak is to face another tricky byelection after former Conservative backbencher Scott Benton resigned before the conclusion of a recall petition among his constituents. The Blackpool South MP was facing likely ejection from the Commons after being suspended for 35 days over his role in a lobbying scandal. Both the US and UK have blamed a Chinese state-backed group they call Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (APT 31). New Zealand blamed a separate group, APT 40. While the UK’s decision to point the finger at China has grabbed headlines, the truth about attacks like the ones described by Oliver Dowden yesterday is that they are “pretty routine”, said Jamie MacColl. “We know that China, North Korea, Russia and Iran [sometimes known as the ‘big four’ cyber threats] are regularly called out,” he said. “There’s less public information or reporting about similar activities from Five Eyes [the anglophone intelligence alliance between the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand] – but that may be because we’re better at it, or care more about being caught, or don’t get identified by US and UK cybersecurity companies because of their relationships. It’s what you would expect powerful states to be doing to one another in cyberspace.” In a sense, though, the routine nature of some of this is part of what makes it ominous. “Interference in politics or democratic processes is always a very serious cyber threat,” MacColl said. “Even if we know what’s happened, we don’t know how it is intended to be used.” The Electoral Commission hack The attack on the Electoral Commission was carried out in August 2021, discovered in October 2022, and only publicly acknowledged in August 2023. Without specifying who was responsible, the Electoral Commission said hackers had gained access to copies of electoral registers with the names and addresses of anyone registered to vote in the UK between 2014 and 2022. Many commentators surmised that Russia was likely behind the incident; in fact, Oliver Dowden said yesterday, “these actions demonstrate a clear and persistent pattern of behaviour that signals hostile intent from China”. The Electoral Commission hack fits with China’s modus operandi for some years, MacColl said. “We’ve seen China targeting very large datasets of information on individuals before,” he said, pointing to a hack of the US Office of Personnel Management in 2015. “There have been similar operations against airlines and insurers.” It’s unlikely that the hack would have been carried out to obtain the details of specific people, MacColl said. “If you want to target a high-profile individual, there are easier ways than sorting through 40m lines on Excel. But it is possible that these datasets are being obtained for some future use, potentially highly individualised disinformation operations. I don’t think we’re there yet, but it may be that in 10 years, with much better machine learning, it’ll be possible to process this information in much more powerful ways.” As evidence for China’s interest in that area, he points to a recent leak from iSoon, a private company headquartered in Shanghai that sells its services to the Chinese government. “Their business critical services were less about the offensive side and more about processing these very large datasets so they can then be exploited.” That same iSoon leak appears to show staff at the company discussing potential attacks on thinktank Chatham House and the NGO Human Rights Watch, as well as the Home Office and Foreign Office. The attack on MPs and peers As well as the Electoral Commission hack, China was also accused yesterday of targeting a group of MPs and peers who are members of Ipac – with the four named politicians all vocal critics of China. One of the MPs, Iain Duncan Smith, said at a press conference yesterday that “the west has to wake up to the fact this is a challenge to the very way that we live our lives”. Like the US hack, the politicians’ email accounts are believed to have been targeted through “spear phishing” – emails that attempt to extract passwords and other sensitive information from targets by appearing to come from an authoritative or trusted source. The US said that the phishing emails contained hidden tracking links which would then send information including the recipient’s location, device and IP to a server controlled by the hackers – which then enabled more targeted follow-up attacks. The UK said that no parliamentary accounts were successfully compromised. While any cyber-attack on an elected official is a problem, it is also “much less significant than targeting the electoral roll, because it isn’t a large-scale way of interfering in democratic processes”, MacColl said. “Targeting individuals in this way falls into the category of fairly routine political intelligence that we would expect a state competing with us to be attempting.” The UK’s defences Yesterday, Rishi Sunak said that the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NTSC) is “world leading”. “It’s true that the UK is very good at cyber,” MacColl said. “But I would characterise it as ‘capable but constrained’ – cybercrime, counter-terrorism, and the war in Ukraine will have eaten up a lot of focus over the last two years.” He also noted that the private sector is now “able to respond in a way that far outweighs what the UK – or even the US – government can do. It’s no coincidence that when a government department or a council gets hit, it’s not the NTSC that does the legwork of fixing it.” To identify the culprit in these kinds of cases, “there will be forensic indicators from things like logs on servers – they will hope to assess those against known examples from different state actors”, MacColl said. Cautioning that he is simplifying considerably, he added: “They might have an IP address that will have been masked in different ways, and which they will try to trace – some have been linked to specific cities or even buildings in China in the past.” The political response China has dismissed the allegations as “malicious slander”. But both the US and UK announced sanctions yesterday against two individuals, Zhao Guangzong and Ni Gaobin, affiliated with a tech company which the US says is a front for the Chinese ministry of state security. They will face travel bans and an asset freeze. There have been criticisms over the pace of the UK’s response, given that more than three years have elapsed since the attack. The move to attribute these cases is likely to be political as much as technical, MacColl said: “It would not be happening without the broader strategic context of terrible relations between the UK and the US and China.” The measures met with some criticism for being inadequate to the scale of the threat – with one of the targeted MPs, the SNP’s Stewart McDonald, accusing ministers of “turning up at a gun fight with a wooden spoon”. They do signal a growing willingness to go public with warnings about Chinese hacking – and greater co-operation between western nations in response. But the sanctions do not appear likely to slow the pace of the Chinese hacking effort.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,686,‘Beyond shocked’: Shohei Ohtani says interpreter stole from him and told lies,"Shohei Ohtani addressed the media on Monday after allegations emerged that his former interpreter stole millions of dollars from his bank account to pay an illegal bookmaker. The Los Angeles Dodgers star, the most famous active baseball player in the world and a huge celebrity in his native Japan, addressed journalists in a press conference but did not take any questions from the media. Last week, Ippei Mizuhara told ESPN that Ohtani had agreed to pay off his interpreter’s gambling debts, which are said to be more than $1m. Mizuhara had placed bets with a bookmaker in California, where gambling is illegal. However, Ohtani’s lawyers soon issued a statement saying Ohtani had been a victim of “massive theft” orchestrated by Mizuhara. In a subsequent interview with ESPN, Mizuhara said he had lied in his initial statement and that Ohtani knew nothing about the gambling debts. Ohtani said he had no idea Mizuhara was going to speak to the media last week, and he only became aware of the interpreter’s gambling problem during a team meeting last week. “All of this has been a complete lie,” Ohtani said on Monday. “Ippei obviously basically didn’t tell me about the media inquiry. So Ippei has been telling everyone around that he has been communicating with me on this account to the media and my team and that hasn’t been true.” Mizuhara, who had a close bond with Ohtani beyond their working relationship, was fired and Major League Baseball later opened an investigation. Ohtani said he had never bet on any sports or knowingly sent money to his former interpreter to cover gambling debts. “[I am] beyond shocked, it’s hard to verbalise how I am feeling at this point,” he said in a prepared statement through his new interpreter, Will Ireton. MLB players are forbidden from betting on baseball, and face a lifetime ban if found to have placed a wager on their own team. They are allowed to bet on other sports in the nearly 40 US states where gambling is legal, but not in California. “I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to do it on my behalf and I have never gone through a bookmaker to bet on sports, and was never asked to assist betting payments for anyone else,” Ohtani said. Mizuhara had been Ohtani’s translator since the star moved from Japan to play for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani joined the Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal. He made his Dodgers debut on Wednesday in a victory over the San Diego Padres in South Korea last week. “Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has told lies,” Ohtani said. Mizuhara said last week that Ohtani did not place any bets himself. “I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting,” he said. The IRS says Mizuhara is under criminal investigation over the allegations.",2024-03-25 22:20:31,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/25/shohei-ohtani-interpreter-gambling-allegations-mlb-baseball,The Guardian,686,medium former interpreter stole million bank account pay illegal bookmaker star famous active baseball player world huge celebrity native japan press conference take medium last week told agreed pay gambling said 1m bookmaker gambling illegal however soon statement saying victim massive theft subsequent interview said lied initial statement knew nothing gambling said idea going speak medium last week aware gambling problem team meeting last week complete lie said obviously basically didnt tell medium inquiry telling everyone around communicating account medium team true close bond beyond working relationship fired major league baseball later investigation said never bet sport knowingly sent money former interpreter cover gambling beyond hard feeling point said prepared statement new interpreter forbidden betting baseball face lifetime ban found wager team bet sport nearly 40 u gambling legal never bet baseball sport never somebody behalf never gone bookmaker bet sport never assist betting anyone else said translator since star japan play 2018 10year 700m deal made debut victory san south korea last week stealing money account told said said last week place want everyone know zero involvement betting said criminal investigation beyond interpreter stole told
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,687,Israel-Gaza war: US says it will ‘find ways’ to warn Israel against Rafah attack despite cancellation of visit – as it happened,"Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has hit back at comments by his war cabinet minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, over the decision to cancel a planned trip for top Israeli officials to Washington over the US decision not to veto the UN security council resolution. The Israeli delegation that was supposed to visit Washington on Tuesday should continue, Gantz argued in a social media post. He wrote: Not only is it right for the delegation to travel – the prime minister would do well if he himself traveled to the USA, and held a direct dialogue with President Biden and the senior administration officials. Gantz, who met with top US leaders during a visit to Washington earlier this month, added: At the same time, it is important to remember – the special relationship between Israel and the United States is an anchor in Israel’s security and foreign relations, and the direct dialogue with the American administration is an essential asset that must not be given up even when there are challenges and disputes. Netanyahu’s office responded that the Israeli leader “rejected the proposal” by Gantz in a statement that said: After Hamas welcomed the Security Council decision that was passed by way of the USA’s abstention, Gantz proposes that a delegation visit the USA. The Prime Minister has rejected his proposal. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: At least 32,333 Palestinians have been killed and 74,694 injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday. The latest figures include at least 21 Palestinians who were reportedly killed by an Israeli airstrike on an apartment block in central Gaza late on Sunday. The UN security council voted to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, after the US dropped a threat to veto, in a significant break with the Israeli government, bringing it to near total isolation on the world stage. The US abstained in a vote in Monday’s security council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan”. It also demanded the release of hostages by Hamas, but did not make the ceasefire dependent on hostage release, a linkage the US had previously insisted on. Hamas welcomed the resolution and said it stood ready for an immediate exchange of prisoners with Israel, raising hopes of a breakthrough in negotiations under way in Doha, where intelligence chiefs and other officials from the US, Egypt and Qatar are seeking to broker a deal that would involve the release of some hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian detainees and prisoners, and a truce that would last an initial six weeks. After the UN vote, the office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a planned visit to Washington by two of his ministers, intended to discuss a planned Israeli offensive on Rafah, which the US opposes. The White House said it was “very disappointed” by the decision. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz argued that the visit should go ahead. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, will still meet with US defense secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior US officials despite the cancellation of a separate visit by an Israeli delegation to Washington. The meeting, set to take place at the Pentagon on Tuesday, will cover a range of topics including the release of hostages held by Hamas and the need for more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the Pentagon’s press secretary said. Israel confirmed it will cease working with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), accusing the organisation of “perpetuating the conflict”. Unrwa has provided essential services to the Palestinians in the occupied territories for decades, and has been at the centre of a bitter controversy after being accused by Israel of collaborating with Hamas in Gaza – a charge it has denied. The medical situation in Gaza’s hospitals has reached an “unimaginable” state of crisis, according to an emergency medical team organised by three aid groups that spent two weeks carrying out surgeries and other care at the European hospital near Khan Younis. Israel’s foreign ministry said Spain, Malta, Slovenia and Ireland are offering “a reward for terrorism” with a joint statement about their readiness to recognise a Palestinian state. Israel has repeatedly insisted that the only way progress towards a two-state solution can be made is by direct talks between Israel and Palestinian authorities that it recognises. Palestinians have argued that this effectively grants Israel a veto over statehood. The US has said it will “find other ways to make our concerns known” regarding Israel’s planned military operation in Rafah despite the decision by Benjamin Netanyahu to scrap an Israeli delegation visit to Washington. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will likely discuss Rafah with visiting Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. He said: We believe this type of full-scale invasion would be a mistake, not just because of the civilian harm that it would cost which would be immense. He added there are currently about 1.4m people in Rafah and Israel has not presented a coherent evacuation plan, adding: This type of invasion would weaken Israel’s security and would make Israel less safe, not more safe. It would undermine its standing in the world. Miller said that while Blinken will likely discuss US concerns over a Rafah invasion during his meeting with Gallant, the secretary of state would not be presenting Washington’s alternative plans for a military operation in the southern Gaza city. The White House has said it was “perplexed” and “disappointed” by Israel’s decision to cancel its delegation’s planned visit to Washington to discuss US concerns over a possible offensive in Rafah. The office of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced it would cancel the visit after the US dropped a threat to veto a UN security council resolution to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “We’re kind of perplexed” by the cancellation, the White House’s national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. He added that the Israeli prime minister’s office seemed to be “choosing to create a perception of daylight here when they don’t need to do that.” US officials had been in touch with Israel throughout the weekend to make Washington’s position known on the UN security council resolution, and to articulate that it was not a change in policy or in support for Israel, a US official told AP. Netanyahu did not talk to US president Joe Biden before he canceled the delegation’s trip, and Biden doesn’t have any immediate plans to phone Netanyahu, the official added. Kirby had earlier said Washington was “very disappointed” the delegation would not be visiting. While the delegation’s trip has been canceled, a separate visit by Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, is proceeding. An Israeli minister, Gideon Saar, has resigned from Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency unity government, citing the fact that he was not included in the country’s highest-level war cabinet. Saar joined the unity government along with several other members of the opposition after the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. His departure, reported by Reuters, is not expected to affect the stability of Netanyahu’s government, which still controls a clear majority in parliament. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has hit back at comments by his war cabinet minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, over the decision to cancel a planned trip for top Israeli officials to Washington over the US decision not to veto the UN security council resolution. The Israeli delegation that was supposed to visit Washington on Tuesday should continue, Gantz argued in a social media post. He wrote: Not only is it right for the delegation to travel – the prime minister would do well if he himself traveled to the USA, and held a direct dialogue with President Biden and the senior administration officials. Gantz, who met with top US leaders during a visit to Washington earlier this month, added: At the same time, it is important to remember – the special relationship between Israel and the United States is an anchor in Israel’s security and foreign relations, and the direct dialogue with the American administration is an essential asset that must not be given up even when there are challenges and disputes. Netanyahu’s office responded that the Israeli leader “rejected the proposal” by Gantz in a statement that said: After Hamas welcomed the Security Council decision that was passed by way of the USA’s abstention, Gantz proposes that a delegation visit the USA. The Prime Minister has rejected his proposal. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has cancelled a scheduled Washington trip for top aides Ron Dermer and Tzachi Hanegbi in response to the US’s decision not to use veto power in the UN security council resolution for a ceasefire without hostage release conditions, according to media reports. Israel accuses the US of undermining war efforts and hostage release attempts, calling it a departure from prior US stance in the security council. The statement calls the decision “a clear retreat from the consistent US position in the Security Council since the beginning of the war,” and one that “gives Hamas hope that international pressure will allow them to get a ceasefire without releasing our hostages,’’ the Times of Israel has reported. The Israeli minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, in response to the UN security council resolution said: The decision of the UN Security Council proves what has been known since time immemorial - this is an anti-Semitic institution, with an anti-Semitic Secretary General, who is encouraging Hamas towards total victory. President Biden’s choice, on the other hand, to avoid vetoing the decision on the part of the USA, proves on the other hand that President Biden does not put the victory of Israel and the free world over terrorism at the top of his priorities, but rather his political considerations. Precisely after this decision, we must increase the intensity of the war and continue striving with all our might, at any cost, to defeat Hamas.  This post was amended on 26 March 2024 to correct the spelling of Itamar Ben-Gvir’s surname. The former US president Donald Trump has said he would have responded to the 7 October Hamas attacks in the same way that Israel did, but argued Israel was losing international support and should wrap up its war in Gaza. Hamas’ killing spree through southern Israel was “one of the saddest things I’ve ever seen”, Trump said in an interview with Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom published on Monday, but: You have to finish up your war. To finish it up. You gotta get it done. And, I am sure you will do that. And we gotta get to peace, we can’t have this going on. And I will say, Israel has to be very careful, because you’re losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done. The secretary general of the Palestinian Authority’s executive committee, Hussein al-Sheikh, has welcomed the UN security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. We welcome the #UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in the #Gaza Strip. We call for a permanent cessation to this criminal war and Israel's immediate withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. https://t.co/woxJznMwQo The 2025 European gymnastics championships will not be staged in Tel Aviv as scheduled because of Israel’s war with Hamas, its governing body announced. In a statement, the governing body of gymnastics in Europe cited “the current situation in Israel” as its reason and said it was reopening the bidding process for a host. It added: We acknowledge the efforts done by the Israeli Gymnastics Federation, the excellent host of several European Championships in the past 8 years. The UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza sent a clear message that the hostages held by Hamas should be released and aid should allowed in to Gaza, Downing Street has said. The UK backed the resolution, which demanded the release of hostages but did not make the ceasefire dependent on hostage release. A spokesperson for the UK prime minister said: We have long called for an immediate humanitarian pause or temporary ceasefire leading to a sustainable ceasefire, which is what this resolution calls for. And that is why the UK voted in favour of it. They said Israel had a right to defend itself, but that “far too many” Palestinians had been killed “and a humanitarian catastrophe is a clear and present risk”. Asked what message the UK government would send to Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Downing Street said: We would obviously urge both sides to listen to that and to follow this resolution. ActionAid has condemned Israel’s decision to block the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza. Unrwa head Philippe Lazzarini, in a social media post on Sunday, said Israeli authorities had informed the UN that they will no longer approve any Unrwa food convoys to the north of Gaza, where the threat of famine is highest. An Israeli official confirmed earlier today that Israel will cease working with the UN agency, accusing the organisation of “perpuating the conflict”. 📍# Gaza: as of today, @UNRWA, the main lifeline for #Palestine Refugees, is denied from providing lifesaving assistance to northern Gaza. Despite the tragedy unfolding under our watch, the Israeli Authorities informed the UN that they will no longer approve  any @UNRWA food… pic.twitter.com/lfp9xRQuh1 ActionAid Palestine’s advocacy and communications coordinator, Riham Jafari, said in a statement: We are utterly horrified and outraged to see Israel pull the plug on the most vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza on the brink of famine right now. With severe hunger claiming children’s lives and severely malnourished women giving birth to stillborn babies, Israel’s decision to cease working with UNRWA is nothing short of a death sentence for those living through immense hunger and suffering. A UN-backed food security assessment has warned that famine was projected to hit the north of Gaza by May unless there was urgent intervention. Unrwa has not been able to deliver food to the north since 29 January, a spokesperson has said. Hamas has welcomed the UN security council resolution and said it stands ready to engage the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. In a statement posted to social media, Hamas said a pause in fighting is needed to “bury our martyrs who have remained under the rubble for months” and for access to “humanitarian needs”. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has welcomed the adoption by the UN security council of a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Von der Leyen, in a social media post, said that implementation of the resolution is “vital for the protection of all civilians”. I welcome the adoption by UN Security Council of a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and the immediate & unconditional release of all hostages.Implementation of this resolution is vital for the protection of all civilians. Here’s the full text of the UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza that was passed on Monday after the US dropped a threat to veto, in a significant break with the Israeli government. The text of the resolution 2728 just adopted by the Council pic.twitter.com/YJpbBUgeW2 Aid groups have been responding to the UN security council vote to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for the month of Ramadan. A statement by the International Rescue Committee calls the UN resolution “a critical turning point” and warns that without a ceasefire that is respected by all parties, Gaza risks facing further catastrophe. It adds: IRC urges Council members, including the United Kingdom, to leverage all their influence to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities and work towards a lasting ceasefire. The UN resolution is a “welcome step forward but long overdue,” according to a statement by Care International UK, which warns that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would have “utterly dire” consequences for civilians, including women and girls. It adds: With famine imminent in Gaza, an immediate ceasefire is the only way to reduce the death toll. The resolution must be implemented, there is no time to lose. Oxfam says it welcomes the UN resolution, but argues that while it is a “step in the right direction"" that it “falls short of the permanent ceasefire which is truly required and comes too late for over 32,000 Palestinians in Gaza that have been killed, and thousands more unaccounted for, while the Security Council wrung its hands over semantics.” It adds: A mere two-week pause is not enough. This initial cessation in violence must lead to a permanent ceasefire that lasts and sustainable peace for Palestinians and Israelis alike; so people in Gaza can mourn their loved ones and begin the long road of recovery and reconstruction. A meeting between the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, and Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, in Washington is still expected to take place, the Pentagon’s press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder has said. The meeting, set to take place at the Pentagon tomorrow, will cover a range of topics including the release of hostages held by Hamas and the need for more humanitarian aid to reach Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he added. The White House has said it is “very disappointed” that Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a high-level Israeli delegation’s planned visit to Washington after the US abstained from a UN security council vote demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. As we reported earlier, Netanyahu’s office announced that a planned visit to Washington by Israeli officials, which was to include Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and head of Israel’s national security council, Tzachi Hanegbi, will no longer take place. White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters: It’s disapppointing. We’re very disappointed that they won’t be coming to Washington DC. to allow us to have a fulsome conversation with them about viable alternatives to them going in on the ground in Rafah.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,688,Vaping debate: doctor’s reticence over declaring tobacco money raises questions about conflict of interest,"A GP opposed to the government’s vaping reforms and whose nicotine prescription website is being assessed by the drug regulator has given school vaping education sessions and spoken at a student conference without declaring she has received financial support from a tobacco company. Dr Carolyn Beaumont owns the vaping telehealth service medicalnicotine.com.au, which allows people to obtain a prescription for nicotine vapes in minutes, without speaking directly to a doctor or pharmacist. The Medical Board of Australia confirmed that this was legal but said the lack of real-time direct consultation was not good practice. The platform is among a number of vaping prescription websites under assessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for potentially encouraging patients to request a particular prescription medicine. In September 2023 Beaumont spoke at the tobacco industry’s Global Forum on Nicotine in Seoul, South Korea, with the forum covering her expenses to attend. She is also a recipient of a Knowledge-Action-Change tobacco harm reduction scholarship. KAC has received funding from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, which in turn is funded by Philip Morris International. Beaumont’s biography for the Global Forum on Nicotine says that as a recipient of the scholarship she is “creating an educational presentation on tobacco harm reduction for Australian medical students”. In June Beaumont spoke on a panel titled Media, Medicine and the Vaping Epidemic at the University of Melbourne’s medical student conference. A University of Melbourne spokesperson said the panellists had been asked to declare any conflicts of interest. “Dr Beaumont declared that she had no conflicts of interest,” the spokesperson said. “At the commencement of the panel session at the conference, all speakers were asked to identify any relationships with industry/research funding. As Dr Beaumont declared no conflict of interest, no declaration was included in the visual display nor was a verbal declaration made.” On her medicalnicotine.com.au website, Beaumont says she runs education sessions for secondary school students and parents about “teenage vaping concerns, and the dangers of becoming addicted to nicotine”. Her website previously included an endorsement from Beaumaris Secondary College, a Victorian government school. A Victorian government spokesperson said Beaumont “proactively approached Beaumaris Secondary College, volunteering to present”. The spokesperson said Beaumont did not declare to the school benefits received from the tobacco or vaping industry: “She did not seek the school’s approval to reference it in promotional materials, and was not paid for her services.” There is no policy requiring guest speakers who are running an education program in schools to disclose any potential conflicts of interests. Guardian Australia understands that policy is now under review. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Beaumont declined to answer questions from Guardian Australia. After she was contacted for a response, a conflict of interest declaration was added to her website. It says that due to the cost of international travel, and without research institution funding, “it has been necessary on occasion to have travel costs covered in part by [the] tobacco industry”. “Note that any such arrangements have been completely unconditional, and have never influenced my clinical decisions.” In the statement Beaumont says “on the balance of evidence” she supports tobacco harm reduction and the role of vaping for adult smokers, as well as reducing youth uptake and “removing the blackmarket”. “Occasional unconditional tobacco-industry funded travel costs are required to achieve these aims, in the absence of alternative sources of funding.” She says the decision to accept such funding is “never made lightly”, and she has “never sought to hide” these sources of funding. Beaumont is opposed to federal government efforts aimed at reducing the supply of nicotine vaping products, including an import ban on disposable vapes. The government has said the aim of its reforms is to reduce supply to children, and they are not intended to criminalise individuals who use vapes, whether adults or children. On her website Beaumont states: “I am passionate about educating teenagers about the real risks of blackmarket vaping – unregulated products with unknown nicotine content, electrical safety hazards, no quality control and unknown levels of harmful contaminants.” In an interview with the Global Forum on Nicotine’s media channel in December, Beaumont spoke of her hopes for 2024, saying: “What I most wish for is for the Australian ban on disposable vapes scheduled to occur on New Year’s Day to be stopped. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “I wish for the planned ban on all personal importation of any vapes scheduled for March to be stopped. I wish for the Australian prescription model of vaping to stop and for the barriers to accessing a doctor to be truly understood and acknowledged.” Despite this, Beaumont operates her own prescription vaping telehealth platform, medicalnicotine.com.au. Guardian Australia followed the steps for obtaining a script online through the site in late February. A Medicare number was not required to be entered, nor was a phone or video consultation needed. After declaring that they are over 16 (which has since been changed to 18) and paying $40, patients are directed to fill out a short questionnaire to receive a script for a six-month supply of vapes, which must be used at the online pharmacy QuickRx. Patients can choose their own vape strength as part of this process, along with their preferred product – pods, disposable vapes or liquid nicotine. Patients are not required to try first-line, evidence-based treatments first. They can simply tick a box stating: “I am not interested in nicotine replacement therapies.” Guardian Australia selected “I wasn’t a regular smoker, but have started vaping instead of taking up smoking (because I have found other benefits to it)” as the reason for wanting a prescription. A spokesperson for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said: “Nicotine vaping products are not recommended for first-line smoking cessation, but may be suitable for smoking cessation in conjunction with behavioural support where first-line therapies have failed. “It is not recommended that non-smokers or non-vapers start vaping.” The spokesperson said patients should also be informed that due to the lack of available evidence, the long-term health effects of nicotine vaping products are unknown; that their safety and quality have not been established; that the lack of uniformity in vaping devices increases the uncertainties and risks associated with their use; and dual use of tobacco and vapes should be avoided. The importance of the patient returning for regular review and monitoring should be emphasised, they said. None of these were communicated in the process of obtaining a prescription from Beaumont’s site. Some parts of the form and questions have been updated since inquiries were made by Guardian Australia. Beaumont did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about accessing a prescription but did comment on an article about vaping on the Medical Republic site. In the comments section, she appeared to refer to some of the questions put to her by Guardian Australia. Beaumont set out why she did not do phone or video consults: “Firstly, timezones. “I’m in Victoria, and many patients are from WA,” she wrote. “There’s a 3 hour gap, so realistically I can’t make calls until midday. Consider also that as a whole, heavy smokers are more likely to work jobs such as construction, mining or hospitality. These jobs don’t lend themselves to taking time out for a phone consult.” She wrote that she disagreed with the Medical Board that telehealth without a phone or video consult was not best medical practice.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,689,Jessie Diggins: ‘Eating disorders are about control when you feel like you have none’,"Cross-country skiing at the elite level feels closer to survivalism than sport, a staredown with existential resistance that requires a tolerance for suffering bordering on inhumane and an appetite for pushing past the outer limits of what the body and mind believe is possible. Jessie Diggins calls it the “pain cave”, the place that endurance athletes enter when they’ve willed themselves beyond their breaking point and every muscle group is gripped with an agony that would leave the rest of us mortals supine and helpless along the trail. Diggins’ hard-won mastery of this aerobic mental and physical torture chamber is what’s carried her from small-town Minnesota to the summit of a sport that was dominated by Europeans for more than a century. That is, until she came along. It’s been four days since Diggins nailed down her second World Cup overall title to put the finishing touches on the most successful season ever for an American cross-country skier. The 32-year-old from the tiny St Paul suburb of Afton (population: 2,951), whose trademark glitter, megawatt smile and almost nuclear positivity have become her calling cards, could clinch the crown with no worse than a 20th-place finish in last Sunday’s season-ending women’s 20km mass start freestyle in the Swedish town of Falun. But rather than playing it safe, Diggins conjured a sensational knockout blow on a course tailor-made to her strengths. Clustered with a gaggle of rivals entering the closing 2.5km, Diggins broke free with one final lung-busting sprint and crossed the finish line first by ninth-tenths of a second ahead of Norway’s Heidi Weng for her sixth individual win of the season, cementing herself as the world’s most dominant cross-country skier. “Even though there was a lot of noise and a lot of pressure and a lot going on, I was racing with a lot of joy and truly having fun,” says Diggins, filling my screen with sparkle and warmth as she grapples with her latest swipe at history. “It felt like making it to the finish line of a four-month season, not just the finish line of a 20km race.” There may not be a fitter athlete than Diggins who, after more than a decade in cross-country skiing’s top flight, is at the height of her powers. Speaking on Zoom from her Massachusetts home, Diggins rates her strength, endurance and technique as better than ever, the result of “putting money in the bank” through countless training hours. Same for her tactical confidence; in mass start races, where all competitors start at the same time and the first skier across the finish line is the winner, she knows when she can get to the front, when she can tuck in the back, when she needs to move around in the pack. Be disarmed by the bubbly demeanor at your peril. Beneath the Minnesota nice is a unyielding competitor willing to persist through pain unimaginable to the outside observer. No woman from outside Europe had ever won the overall crystal globe, cross-country skiing’s biggest prize, until Diggins three years ago. Now she’s done it twice. But her career-best campaign was nearly derailed before it started last summer when she experienced a relapse of an eating disorder after more than 12 years of recovery. As the start of the season drew near, she went public with her struggle on social media and spoke with remarkable candor and vulnerability on her “constant battle” with a condition that will affect nearly 10% of Americans at some point in their lives. “There’s so much stigma and misinformation out there,” Diggins tells me. “Eating disorders are a mental illness, not a behavioral choice. It can affect anyone of any age, any race, any background. It’s not just something that targets skinny white teenage women, right? Because that is often what people think of. That’s not necessarily the case. “The other thing people should understand is it may, and in fact it often is, not at all about food or your body. It’s about looking for a feeling of control when you feel like you have none in your life. It’s about looking for an illusion of feeling safe when you feel like things are spiraling out of your control. So for me, I had been working too hard for too long and I was feeling incredibly overwhelmed and my eating disorder served as a crutch to kind of numb these overwhelming feelings when I felt like I couldn’t deal with them.” Diggins was 18, and had just graduated high school, when a mounting battle with bulimia nervosa led her to the doors of the Emily Program, a Minnesota-based recovery treatment center. There she assembled a support group that included a therapist, a dietician, a physician and a sports psychologist who she still works with to this day. “I have had wonderful consistency in someone who knows my complete history, who knows me super well. We talk pretty much every single week and we’ve built up this very strong safety net in all the good times. When literally nothing is wrong in my life, we’re still going to talk about all things that are going on and figure out different systems so that if something goes wrong, we’re not scrambling. We build the safety net for when we need it,” she says. “And then when I did need it this year, we brought on a doctor who specializes in eating disorders and a sport dietician who also specializes in outpatient eating disorder recovery. We supplemented my care team with other professionals trained specifically in the eating disorder world.” That collective proved crucial to getting Diggins to the starting line when the season got under way in November. Her mantra from the outset was to “take it day by day, one race at a time”. She brims with gratitude for her teammates and coaches for accommodating the open-ended challenges that mental health treatment demands. “It’s very different than let’s say you break your arm and it’s like, alright, you can expect to have a cast on for this many weeks and then this happens and that happens, and you might not exactly stick to that timeline, but you have a pretty good idea of how this is going to go and how you’re going to heal and what that’s going to look like,” she says. “With mental health, you don’t have any of that, and that’s really, really challenging. There isn’t a definitive timeline, it’s not necessarily just linear progress. You might take three steps forward, one step back and so on. So I definitely wasn’t sure how this season was going to look. And it was really important to me that I didn’t commit to the entire season.” Diggins first made history at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, when she and Kikkan Randall won the team sprint in a heart-stopping finish over Sweden to earn the first ever US Olympic gold for cross-country skiing. But while the Olympics bring unparalleled attention, winning the crystal globe is cross-country skiing’s most difficult and prestigious feat, rewarding season-long consistency and durability across all disciplines. The grueling World Cup circuit is made up of 34 races from November to March across sprints and distance events in both classic and freestyle techniques, all of them contests of extreme physical and psychological intensity. No woman from outside Europe had ever won the overall World Cup title before Diggins during the Covid-shortened 2020-21 campaign. Winning it again was never going to be easy under the best of circumstances. Heartened by the support of her team, Diggins relied on her craft and fighting spirit to rack up results early and often. Amid subzero temperatures in a 20km freestyle race on the season-opening weekend in Ruka, Finland, just below the Arctic Circle, she managed to climb back through the pack and finish second after losing her right ski-pole and glove with about one mile left and suffering a bleeding gash, red-lining it through the final stretch with her right hand exposed to the elements. Think Eric Liddell on powder. Olihan veto Jessie Digginsiltä! Sauva poikki kärkipaikalta, hanska putosi matkasta, uusi sauva huollolta suoraan naamaan, naama auki ja silti taisteli itsensä toiseksi! 🥈#ViaplayTalvi pic.twitter.com/J0C9abADC6 Her first win of the year came the next week in a notice-serving 10k skate in Gällivare, Sweden. She went on to win the marquee Tour de Ski, a seven-stage, nine-day series of races modeled after the Tour de France that straddles the New Year, for the second time. By the middle of February, she’d opened a yawning lead of 340 points atop the overall leaderboard, spending more than 100 days wearing the yellow overall leader’s bib. Sweden’s Linn Svahn was able to narrow the gap to 75 points entering Sunday’s season finale, but Diggins closed in style for her sixth solo win of the year, surpassing Randall’s single-season American mark. She also secured her second distance crown, finishing 224 points ahead of Germany’s Victoria Carl. But for all the history made, records broken and rivals bested, what Diggins calls the highlight of her career happened in February when her long-sought dream of competing on home soil was realized with the Stifel Loppet Cup in Minneapolis, only 25 miles west of her hometown, drawing more than 40,000 spectators over two days to the first World Cup race to be staged in the US in 23 years. From the day after she’d won Olympic gold in South Korea, Diggins had made it her personal mission to leverage her elevated profile toward bringing the World Cup circuit back to the US, an exhaustive process that included courting sponsors behind the scenes. “It was surreal and I had dreamed about this for my entire career,” says Diggins, whose only exposure to World Cup races growing up was on the VHS tapes her father would buy at a local ski shop months after they took place. “It was something I’d always wanted. The biggest thing that I’d wanted to do is race at home and having 20,000 people each day, people screaming your name grown men wearing glitter all over their faces because they were cheering for me. It was so special to feel so connected to the ski community and to see what this sport meant to so many other people.” Moments like these comes few and far between in a sport that rarely captures the attention of the American public, even during the Winter Olympics. Compared to the heart-pounding velocity of alpine skiing, exhilarating beauty of figure skating and Nascar-on-ice voyeurism of short track, the grind of cross-country skiing has never been an easy sell for US audiences. But few have done more than Diggins to raise the sport’s profile. Before 2018, the United States had won only a single medal in cross-country skiing at the Olympics, back in 1976. By completing her color set in Beijing with a silver (in the 30km freestyle) and bronze (the individual sprint), Diggins tripled that haul by herself within a four-year span. When it comes to disadvantages facing US cross-country skiers, Diggins points to the comparatively small base of athletes and lack of funding relative to the Nordic countries, where the sport is far more popular and lucrative professionally. “We have to be really scrappy,” she says. “A lot of people who are racing World Cup are working second jobs, fundraising really hard to get over there. So you’re definitely in the sport for the right reasons, because you’re not in the sport to get rich and famous. I think that’s one of the reasons it draws such incredible people, but it also becomes a very big challenge and hurdle, and you don’t want anyone to have to give up their career dreams because of funding. That’s a hard reason to have to be done in the sport. And so that’s something that we’re always working on, is how do we support athletes as they work to get to that next level and take those next steps.” It’s no secret that many Olympians devote their lives to activities that aren’t exactly fast tracks to fame and fortune. But even by that standard, cross-country skiing is a hard bargain, right there with boxing for the least favorable pain-to-prestige ratio of any sport. Asked what keeps her motivated after more than half a lifetime in the pain cave and with so little remaining to achieve, Diggins’ infectious passion shoots to the surface. “I love the people and the culture,” she says. “This sport attracts really remarkable people and nobody’s too cool. You can’t be too cool when you’re covered in frozen snot and you’re exhausted at the finish line. It’s just such a humbling sport.” Opportunities to build on her legacy abound. The world championships, which are held every other winter, will take place next year in Norway. Beyond that, a fourth Olympic appearance at the 2026 Winter Games in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo is clearly there for the taking, where Diggins could round off her résumé as the first American to win an individual Olympic cross-country skiing gold. But for now, skiing can wait. Diggins will spend her offseason rewatching Ted Lasso, her new favorite show which, she keenly observes, “really nails it from a sports psychology perspective”, as well as hiking in Patagonia with her husband of two years on their long-delayed honeymoon. “I haven’t even thought about [next year],” Diggins says. “I think I’m still absorbing this season. I always want to improve my process. I always want to improve my technique. I always want to improve on those process-oriented goals. Honestly, I may not even set outcome-oriented goals. It just needs to stay about the process.” In the US, help is available at nationaleatingdisorders.org or by calling ANAD’s eating disorders hotline at 800-375-7767.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,690,A minimum wage alone can’t fix the UK poverty scandal,"Next month will mark 25 years since the national minimum wage was first paid in Britain: a quarter of a century during which what was once seen as a radical leftwing policy has won broad cross-party support. Over the past 14 years, the Conservatives have appropriated and expanded the policy, despite adopting a laissez-faire approach to other aspects of labour market regulation. First set by then chancellor Gordon Brown at £3.60 an hour for over-21s, the minimum wage was part of Labour’s 1997 manifesto – though not deemed grabby enough to make it on to Tony Blair’s election pledge card. The Conservatives opposed the legislation as it made its way through parliament after the general election, warning that it would destroy jobs. Less than a year after it came into force, however, shadow chancellor Michael Portillo announced that his party would not reverse it, saying that at the “modest” level at which it had been set, the measure had done “less damage to employment than we feared”. Labour had worked painstakingly to build up support for the minimum wage in the run-up to 1997. The low pay commission (LPC), which would give the government independent advice on setting the pay floor, was to include representatives from business as well as trade unions and labour market experts. The LPC’s first report – published in 1998, after it had held more than 200 evidence-gathering meetings across the country – cited egregious cases of exploitation, including a security guard job advertised at £2 an hour, with the successful applicant expected to supply their own dog. During the coalition years that followed Labour’s defeat in 2010, the Conservatives used increases in the minimum wage as part of a bid to style themselves as the “workers’ party”. In 2015, George Osborne effectively rebranded the minimum wage as the “national living wage” – co-opting a name first used by grassroots group Citizens UK in its successful anti-poverty campaign – and set a surprisingly radical aspiration of lifting it to 60%, and later two-thirds, of median earnings. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader who had campaigned against poverty, punched the air in the House of Commons chamber when the policy was announced. This ambitious target meant the LPC had to continue recommending chunky increases in the minimum wage, as part of whatthe Resolution Foundation thinktank has called a “transformative” policy. By 2023, the UK’s minimum wage was higher, relative to average wages, than in any other rich country apart from France, New Zealand and South Korea. It helped to reduce hourly wage inequality and made some of the worst examples of poverty pay a thing of the past. And it is set to increase again, by almost 10%, on 1 April. Yet the national living wage has been a small island of progress in a labour market that has seen short-term, zero-hours contracts proliferate, out-of-work and sickness benefits eroded, and fire-and-rehire policies going unpunished. And while the rules are laudable, their enforcement is another ongoing issue: trade unions warn that HMRC, whose job it is to police the minimum wage, lacks the resources to do so effectively. At the same time, the number of people in the UK who are economically inactive for health reasons has hit a record high, at 2.8 million: the UK is an outlier among major economies in having a workforce that has shrunk since Covid. The national living wage is here to stay. An incoming Labour government would offer a “genuine living wage”, according to the shadow deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, as part of the party’s promise to build “a Britain that works for working people”. In practice, that will mean asking the LPC to take more account of the cost of living in setting the pay floor, though it is unclear whether that will make much difference, after a string of significant increases. What is clear, though, is that while the widely admired policy has tackled a longstanding bugbear of the UK labour market – the prevalence of low pay – it left wider issues untouched. Last week’s figures showing that 300,000 children were plunged into poverty during the cost of living crisis, with hunger and deprivation rising, underlined the fact that while raising the minimum wage may be a necessary condition for tackling poverty in the UK, it is very far from sufficient.  This article was amended on 28 March 2024. An earlier version referred to Angela Rayner as the “deputy prime minister” when shadow deputy prime minister was meant.",2024-03-24 08:00:44,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/24/a-minimum-wage-alone-cant-fix-the-uk-poverty-scandal,The Guardian,690,next month mark 25 since national minimum wage first quarter century seen radical policy broad support past 14 expanded policy despite approach labour market regulation first set chancellor brown £ 360 hour over21s minimum wage part 1997 manifesto though enough make tony election pledge card opposed legislation made way parliament general election warning would destroy le year came force however shadow chancellor party would reverse saying modest level set measure done le damage employment feared labour worked painstakingly build support minimum wage 1997 low pay commission would give government independent advice setting pay floor include business well trade labour market first report 1998 200 across country egregious exploitation security guard job £ 2 hour successful applicant supply dog coalition defeat 2010 used minimum wage part bid style party 2015 effectively minimum wage national living wage name first used group successful antipoverty campaign set surprisingly radical aspiration lifting 60 later median earnings smith former tory leader poverty air house common chamber policy ambitious target meant continue chunky minimum wage part resolution foundation transformative policy 2023 minimum wage higher relative average wage rich country apart new south korea reduce hourly wage inequality made worst poverty pay thing past set increase almost 10 1 yet national living wage small island progress labour market seen proliferate sickness eroded going unpunished laudable enforcement another ongoing issue trade warn whose job police minimum wage effectively time number people economically inactive health hit record high 28 million outlier among major shrunk since covid national living wage stay incoming labour government would offer genuine living wage according shadow deputy prime minister part promise build work working people practice mean take account cost living setting pay floor though unclear whether make much difference string significant clear though widely admired policy tackled bugbear labour market prevalence low pay left untouched last showing 300000 poverty cost living crisis hunger deprivation rising fact raising minimum wage may necessary condition tackling poverty far sufficient article 28 march 2024 version deputy prime minister shadow deputy prime minister meant minimum wage alone cant fix poverty scandal
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,691,Code Dependent by Madhumita Murgia review – understanding the human impacts of AI,"What’s in the box? That’s the question almost everyone that Madhumita Murgia speaks to seems to be asking. If the “black box” of the algorithm is going to make critical decisions about our health, education or human rights, it would be nice to know exactly what it contains. So long as it remains a mystery, what can you do if you find your child added to a list of potential future criminals based on flawed, even racist, data, as happened to hundreds of families in the Netherlands in the late 2010s?It’s these Kafkaesque absurdities, and how they play out on a human level, that interest Murgia, the Financial Times’s first artificial intelligence editor. Code, she reminds us several times in this troubling book, is not neutral. This isn’t a story about ChatGPT and the other large language models and their looming impact on everything from Hollywood to homework, though there is a bit of that. Instead, it’s an account of how the everyday algorithms we have already learned to live beside are changing us: from the people paid (not much) to make sense of vast datasets, to the unintended consequences of the biases they contain. It’s also the story of how the AI systems built using that data benefit many of us (you, ordering McDonald’s on UberEats) at the expense of some – usually individuals and communities that are already marginalised (the young immigrant worker picking up your Big Mac for a small fee). The scope of Murgia’s reporting here, reflective of her day job, is vast. She takes us from the sometimes comically basic way AI systems are trained (workers in a Kenyan office block labelling road signs to teach driverless cars to recognise them) to how its flaws play out in the finished product (the delivery drivers paid less because their app doesn’t account for delays caused by roadworks or having to cycle uphill). Murgia also argues that we are seeing the emergence of a new data colonialism. Yes, many subcontracted AI labourers are pulled out of poverty by this work, but the wealth created by it is not shared equitably. Then there’s the sheer monotony of it, the inability to deviate from instructions and regional disparities in pay and job security, not to mention the PTSD that results from being forced to look at the worst images on the internet so the rest of us don’t have to. And, crucially, because the AI supply chain is broken down into chunks, many of these workers are told nothing about the purpose of the task they have been given – or even who they’re working for. One Kenyan lawyer Murgia meets sees algorithm training as another version of the Bangladeshi clothing industry that supplies western fast-fashion brands. Or even the designer goods sector: “The factory worker just thinks, all I’m making is a shoe. They don’t know their shoe is being sold for $3,000.” Sign up to Bookmarks Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s. Literary delights delivered direct you after newsletter promotion There is a little optimism. Murgia – a former Wired writer – is alive to the potential of AI to improve health outcomes. And we meet people such as Hiba, whose family, refugees from Falluja, in Iraq, used their work as data labourers to fund a new life in Bulgaria. There are also cheering stories of how frustration at being exploited has led to gig economy workers quietly organising – even in China – to regain some of the autonomy they have sacrificed at “the altar of the algorithm”. But the bass note here is pessimistic. We are way past the techno-boosterism of the early 00s, and, for every government official wondering how AI can help them streamline health and welfare services, there are thousands of people asking whether it will allow them to continue making a living. Worse than that, as in the Chinese government’s facial recognition systems and pre-emptive detention lists in Xinjiang, it’s the story of a dystopia we are already living in.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,692,"England ‘ready to win’ Euros, Leicester launch legal action: football news – as it happened","Huge thanks for joining us today. Tune in later for MBM coverage of the Netherlands v Scotland (7.45pm GMT kick-off). Here’s some reading to catch you up with some of today’s news lines. Have a splendid weekend! Championship promotion hopefuls Ipswich have confirmed a “significant investment” of up to £105m from US-based private equity firm Bright Path Sports Partners. The deal will see BPSP secure a 40% stake in the club. As a result, ORG, which manages funds for PSPRS (the Arizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System) remains the majority and controlling shareholder, retaining a 50% holding. Current Ipswich chief executive Mark Ashton will continue to manage the day-to-day running of the club, with new investors Bright Path Sports “providing capital and strategic thinking which will be of significant benefit”. ORG co-founder and principal Ed Schwartz said on the club’s website: “When we purchased Ipswich Town in 2021, we did so with the initial aim of restoring the club to the Championship and becoming competitive at this level, with the plan always including bringing a partner on board when the time was right. The club’s progress means we feel that time is now and we are excited to welcome Bright Path Sports.” PA Media Here’s our news story on the latest at Leicester. Leicester City have issued legal proceedings against the Premier League and English Football League after being dismayed by the action taken by the two organisations. Leicester are facing the potential double whammy of being docked points by both leagues owing to alleged financial breaches. The Foxes, who were relegated from the top flight last season, have been placed under a transfer embargo by the EFL for allegedly exceeding the upper loss threshold in their profitability and sustainability calculations relating to the 2023-24 season. Leicester say they dispute “the EFL’s entitlement to impose this constraint, which is both restrictive and premature”. The accounting period for 2023-24 ends on 30 June. Unless the club generate millions through sales before then, they are at risk of a points deduction from the EFL. Read more here … Bosnia and Herzegovina v Israel – off. Israel’s scheduled friendly in Sarajevo next Tuesday has been cancelled, with Uefa citing the “current security situation” as a reason. The two men’s teams had been due to meet after both were eliminated from the Euros qualifying playoffs. Israel lost to Iceland 4-1 in yesterday’s “home” game in Budapest, Hungary – it had to play in a neutral country because of security concerns during the current crisis in the Middle East. Associated Press Oh, but corner. With political leaders weighing in on the multicoloured St George’s Cross, several have pointed out the following examples of artistic license with flags that didn’t cause such a hoo-haa. Nike have said their piece on Collargate. Echoing the FA’s earlier words on the subject, they have issued their own statement on the apparently contentious England shirt. We have been a proud partner of the FA since 2012 and understand the significance and importance of the St George’s Cross and it was never our intention to offend, given what it means to England fans. Together with the FA, the intention was to celebrate the heroes of 1966 and their achievements. The trim on the cuffs takes its cues from the training gear worn by England’s 1966 heroes, with a gradient of blues and reds topped with purple. The same colours also feature an interpretation of the flag on the back of the collar.” More from Sven. My father was a Liverpool fan – he’s still a Liverpool fan. In 1979 I wrote to the club and asked if I could come to watch a training session. They replied, and invited me – I was honoured to go to the boot room. That was great, fantastic. It’s like a dream. I could never have dreamt about that. When I was a manager, I always dreamt about Liverpool – but it never happened. It was close once, there was some discussion once. But now? It happens! When they asked I thought it was a joke … but I said: ‘Of course!’” The squad he’ll oversee tomorrow is scheduled to feature an Anfield return for Fernando Torres, as well as Steven Gerrard, Jerzy Dudek, Sami Hyypia and Daniel Agger. Recent Guardian interviewee Jari Litmanen will join Ryan Babel in running out for both Liverpool and Ajax, having been on the books of both during their playing days. Today’s Football Daily is in. Featuring England v Brazil lead-up, Shirtgate and more. Heartwarming corner. Sven Gøran-Eriksson revealed in early January that he has pancreatic cancer, and was expected to only have a year to live. In the media rounds surrounding his announcement, he was asked about any regrets from his career, and dropped in that he’d have loved to have managed Liverpool. Calls were duly made, and last month it emerged that he would be coaching a legends side against Ajax. That game is tomorrow, in aid of the LFC Foundation (3pm GMT KO), and he’s currently talking to the media about it. A quick excerpt: “I’m very, very happy and I’m very, very lucky that I get to see people celebrate the things I have done while I’m still alive. I’m happy they’re telling me while I’m still alive … It makes my heart warm.” Go ‘ed, Sven. Leicester added that they are now under a transfer embargo. The club statement continues … The Club further notes that at 4pm today the EFL issued a public notification that LCFC has been placed under a registration embargo pursuant to its P&S rules. The EFL is aware that LCFC has disputed the EFL’s entitlement to impose this constraint, which is both restrictive and premature, with more than a quarter of the Club’s 2023/24 reporting period remaining. News just in, following Leicester’s charge over an alleged breach of profit and sustainability rules. The Foxes have now issued their own response, in which they state they are taking legal action against both the Premier League and the EFL. A club statement reads … LCFC has been compelled today to issue two urgent legal proceedings against the Premier League and the EFL. LCFC will be seeking that each of these proceedings is determined by an appropriate and fully independent legal panel. The Club is committed to ensure that any charges against it are properly and proportionately determined, in accordance with the applicable rules, by the right bodies, and at the right time. While LCFC would prefer the proceedings to be in public, so its supporters and the wider world can be informed about the important issues of football governance that will be considered, the relevant rules require that these proceedings are conducted confidentially, and LCFC will therefore not be able to comment further about them at this stage. We reaffirm the Club’s position that we will continue to fight for the right of Leicester City and all clubs to pursue their ambitions, particularly where these have been reasonably and fairly established through sustained sporting achievement. Mailbox corner. Someone named after my post-shift role today, Stuart Fryer (I’m plotting egg and chips later), is weighing in sagely on Shirtgate. “Rishi somewhat surprised me with his rather unconventional (and itchy) preference for the ‘original England shirt’ [see 11.45am] …” Check out The True 1870s Original here. Taylor’s United counterpart, Marc Skinner, has no plans to roll over. Though 12 points off the top, he backs his side to upset the form table. “We’ve got to chase and that’s what we’re here to do,” Skinner said. “We’ve got to go to the Etihad, a very difficult place, against a very difficult team, and we’ve got to go and try to win a game of football. Not many teams (beat City), and that’s what we’ve got to break. We’ve done it before and that’s what we’ll aim to do again.” More lead-up to tomorrow’s Manchester derby in the WSL. City’s manager, Gareth Taylor, reckons it could be the biggest yet in the women’s game. His side are level on points with Chelsea at the top, while United are fourth, but with Liverpool breathing down their necks. Asked if the stakes were at their highest for the cross-city clash, Taylor said: “It would be hard to deny that. For us certainly the games are really important now but, whether it’s United this week, Liverpool next week, West Ham after that, Bristol City away – those games are super-important as well. The margin for error is really tight and any dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. “Hopefully we can get a really good crowd in, and I’m sure we will do. We’re looking at trying to capture the imaginations of as many young people as we possibly can. I’m sure the support’s going to be there tomorrow and they’re going to be right behind us.” Wimbledon and MK Dons have been fined a total of £10,500 and Harry Pell £1,000 with a one-match ban after an ill-tempered League Two clash between the clubs. The two clubs admitted failing to control the behaviour of their players after a mass brawl following the final whistle in the home side’s 1-0 win at the Cherry Red Records Stadium on 2 March, and have received with £8,000 and £2,500 sanctions respectively. Pell, an unused Wimbledon substitute in the game, admitted misconduct after appearing to kick balls towards MK Dons fans during the warm-up. A statement on the Football Association’s website said: “AFC Wimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons have been fined £8,000 and £2,500 respectively for their mass confrontation. While admitting the charge levelled at them, Wimbledon have appealed against the penalty. A statement on the club’s official website said: “AFC Wimbledon have been fined £8,000 for a breach of FA Rule E20: mass confrontation during our match on 2 March 2024. Whilst we have accepted the charge, we have submitted an appeal regarding the level of the sanction.” Trouble flared at the end of the game after Ronan Curtis’ last-gasp strike had secured victory for AFC Wimbledon, the club set up as Wimbledon FC prepared to move to Milton Keynes and become MK Dons. PA Media Let’s be clear, however … Adidas didn’t always get it right. Here’s Bernd Schneider in a 2002 World Cup qualifying playoff against Ukraine, looking like they’ve used tracky pant legs as sleeves … Many thanks Yara, good day, all. I’m still trying to process it’ll be like to live in a world where the German kit doesn’t have three stripes on it – it’s been a while … That is all from me for today. Stuart Goodwin is here to take you through to the end of the day. Thank you for all your emails and enjoy your weekend! The DFB announced that Germany’s association with Adidas will end and the national teams’ new kit will be supplied by Nike from 2027 until at least 2034. The German national team have worn the distinctive three-striped logo of Adidas since 1950. The brand was founded in a town near Nuremberg the year before. The German economy minister Robert Habeck told local news agency Dpa that he “could hardly imagine the German kit without the three stripes”, calling it “a piece of German identity”. The Bavarian premier Markus Soeder said: “The success story began in 1954 with the unforgettable World Cup victory, which gave our country self-confidence again. That’s why it’s wrong, a shame and also incomprehensible that this story should end now.” He added German football should not be “a pawn in international corporate battles”. The DFB said that Nike had made “the best financial offer” and also committed to supporting “amateur and grassroots sport”. Some Friday afternoon listening for you.  On yesterday’s Football Weekly Extra, Max Rushden was joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Liew and Ben Fisher to discuss Manchester United’s Kobbie Mainoo call up to the national team and whether he might be the answer to give Gareth Southgate’s midfield balance. Plus: Josh Widdicombe joins the panel in part three to discuss his new podcast series about Ali Dia, and when Barry met Harry at Cheltenham. Matty Cash will miss Poland’s Euro 2024 play-off final against Wales due to injury. The Aston Villa player suffered a suspected hamstring injury 11 minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute in yesterday’s 5-1 play-off semi-final win over Estonia. A great night in Warsaw ended in a bad one for me! Best of luck in the final everyone! Let’s go Polska! 1 more 🇵🇱 pic.twitter.com/lEugGzs4rj Some more emails on kitgate and other games this weekend! Jonathan writes: The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said that he “prefers the original England shirt”. What on earth does that even mean?? I do wish journalists would challenge such opportunistic shit-stirring nonsense. Starmer isn’t much better on this. I bet if asked, Sunak would say his favourite Beatles album is The Best of The Beatles. And Thomas is hopeful: Good to see Derby get a mention – in the company of Man City even! On a trip home last weekend (from the US) I watched them play promotion rivals Bolton. Bolton were by far the better team but Derby got the 1-0 win with massive support from a sold out 32,000+ crowd. Derby play Northampton tomorrow with a chance to extend their lead over Bolton to seven points and close to within two of Portsmouth. Given that Bolton still have to play Portsmouth and none of Derby’s remaining fixtures are against any of the top 8, things are looking hopeful for a return to the Championship. And Ben puts it succinctly: Hi Yara. The thing I find most tiresome about all this shirt chat (and that is a heavily contested category) is that all the usual rent-a-gobs who will be piping up about this will not also be banging the drum about Fifa’s hands off approach to those poor souls who will be building their stadiums. They will remain weirdly silent about the news just published in this blog about the FA essentially ignoring evidence about concussions and brain injury. They will somehow keep their cool about the horrible use of racism or tragedy chanting (a deplorable practice but now so common it has shorthand name) or the abandonment of promising young players by big teams. There are a million issues in football that are far more pressing and worthwhile of political intervention, yet as with everything with our current political status quo, the best we can hope for is some culture wars ping-pong on the deck of the Titanic. Grim reading that but very well said. Harvey Elliott pressed his claims for a late run into England’s Euro 2024 squad with two goals in the under-21s’ 5-1 victory over Azerbaijan. The 20-year-old Liverpool midfielder took his tally to seven goals in six matches and is now the leading scorer across the whole of this Under-21 Euros qualifying campaign. Elliott will hope to catch Gareth Southgate’s eye again at home to Luxembourg in Bolton on Tuesday as he looks to follow the Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in breaking into the senior setup. Chelsea’s Noni Madueke scored his fourth of the campaign as the visitors pressed home their dominance with two goals inside five first-half minutes, with Aston Villa’s Jaden Philogene and Elliott scoring after the break before the debutant Archie Gray scored the fifth in the 88th minute. It means the reigning European champions are the tournament’s leading goalscorers with 25 and they drew level on points with Group F leaders Ukraine, who head to Baku on Tuesday. PA Media The Football Association have responded to the backlash surrounding the new England kit and has defended the multicoloured St George’s Cross, saying it was part of a tribute to the team that won the World Cup in 1966. An FA spokesperson said: The new England 2024 Home kit has a number of design elements which were meant as a tribute to the 1966 World Cup winning team. The coloured trim on the cuffs is inspired by the training gear worn by England’s 1966 heroes, and the same colours also feature on the design on the back of the collar. It is not the first time that different coloured St George’s cross-inspired designs have been used on England shirts. We are very proud of the red and white St George’s cross – the England flag. We understand what it means to our fans, and how it unites and inspires, and it will be displayed prominently at Wembley tomorrow – as it always is – when England play Brazil.” Read the full story here. More thoughts on the England shirt drama. Adam writes: Hi Yara. Ireland fan here. Kit designers have typically avoided modifying national symbols (crosses, dragons, harps, etc.) and played loose and fast with the exact colours (see Ireland World Cup kit). The expanded colour scheme on the cross is (IMHO) kind of nice and reminiscent of highlights from NHS branding. Fifty bonus politics points to the first party to U-turn and embrace the colour scheme as patriotic. I actually thought it was an NHS tribute when I first saw the kit. And I do find the politics around it a bit tiresome. Especially given that this is not the first time the kits have donned non-traditional St George’s Cross. Gianpiero is a happy Welsh fan: Great win last night … Makes you forget about the rugby debacle …. On to Poland … Who knows??!!! CYMRU AM BYTH!!! And Lisa hopes for more from Gareth Southgate tomorrow: Hello Yara. I did not know that the Brazil team was so depleted going into tomorrow. I pray that means we get to see a more adventurous lineup from Gareth. Would love to see some of the young lads go toe-to-toe with BRAZIL! Harry Maguire says England have players who can produce in big moments and the squad is ready to win the Euros in Germany this summer. I feel that as a group, we’re ready to win. If you are to win the Euros, you are probably going to have to win a penalty shootout. Tournament football is built on big moments. The quarter-final against France at the 2022 World Cup could have gone either way but it went to them. We have the players to produce the big moments. We have to be mentally prepared so that in this tournament, we make these moments ours. Maguire also spoke about the criticism for his performances last year and claimed that playing for England as a Manchester United player brings added scrutiny. I think that different clubs have different scrutiny on players. I think every player who’s played for United and the country has come to a time when they’ve played for the country and people haven’t been happy. It’s part and parcel of football and playing for such a historic club. I wouldn’t change it for the world. The Football Association “was always fully aware” of the risk of concussion and brain injury to players as early as the 1980s but failed to take steps to improve safety, the high court has been told. Lawyers representing several former footballers and their families have said in court documents that minutes from an FA committee meeting in 1983 “indicate” that it knew of the risk posed by head injuries “but failed to take action to reduce the risk of players to the lowest reasonable level”. Ten former professional footballers – and the families of a further seven who have died – are suing the FA, the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the English Football League (EFL) and the sport’s law-making body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab). Read the full story below. Any thoughts, musings, questions, complaints or epiphanies on how your team will fare this weekend? Whether it is England, Wales, Manchester City, Derby, Crewe or Dundee United, send me an email. How have Brazil fared in this post-Tite era? Not great. They’re winless in their last four games, all World Cup qualifiers, having drawn with Venezuela before registering back-to-back-to-back losses against Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina. These upcoming friendlies will be massive to boost some morale ahead of the Copa América this summer. Dorival Júnior is certainly excited about the match at Wembley and is keen to get the good vibes back to Brazil again. Read our interview here where he talks World Cup, England and his best Brazil team of all time. Thanks Luke and hello all! Happy Friday! We know quite a bit about how England will be shaping up in tomorrow’s friendly, but what about Brazil? Dorival Júnior has a depleted squad to choose from as he prepares to name the very first lineup of his tenure. The Seleção are without (deep breath) Neymar, Marquinhos, Éder Militão and Casemiro, Alisson, Ederson, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Magalhães. (And exhale). Raphinha, Rodrygo, Vinícius Júnior and Richarlison are expected to start but for fans at Wembley, there will certainly be some new faces on display. With both mainstay keepers out, one of three uncapped goalkeepers will be making their first team debut: Leo Jardim, Bento or Rafael. Sávio, the 19-year-old wonderkid, who is heavily linked with Manchester City may also make an appearance. That’s the lot from me. Yara El-Shaboury is here to guide you through the next bit. It was a burst that proved the catalyst for Wales’s resounding 4-1 win over Finland, another absorbing night under the lights in Cardiff. With a couple of minutes gone, Harry Wilson received the ball on the left flank, about 30 yards from goal, and punched a pass into Brennan Johnson with the outside of his left foot. Seeking a one-two, Wilson charged past five blue shirts, picked up the baton on the perimeter of the box then beat another in Matti Peltola before getting a shot away. It was an arced run that quickened the pulse and subsequently soothed the inevitable anxieties in the stands. Say what you like about the new England football kit, it’s definitely not as bad as Nike’s effort for the Rugby World Cup back in 2007, is it? Saturday’s Manchester derby in the WSL could see City hit the top of the table. Will Unwin reports: Given the supposed furore about the England kit, Gareth Southgate’s answer to the inevitable question from the media later today will be interesting. Commercial imperatives (the fact they’ve already manufactured the kit, that is) will ensure Nike won’t be backing down any time soon. It follows that a suitably approving line has to be found regarding the design.",2024-03-22

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,693,North Korea cancels World Cup qualifier against Japan,"North Korea has abruptly cancelled its 2026 World Cup qualifying match with Japan next week, leaving organisers frantically searching for an alternative venue. North Korea reportedly decided it would no longer host the match, which had been scheduled for next Tuesday at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang, a day before the teams met in Tokyo on Thursday in the first of their two Asian qualifying Group B qualifiers. Minutes after that game, which Japan won 1-0, Kozo Tashima, the president of the Japan Football Association, told reporters that the return match in the North Korean capital would not go ahead. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said the match had been called off due to “unforeseen circumstances”. “The decision, taken in consultation with Fifa and relevant stakeholders, comes after the AFC was informed on 20 March by the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] Football Association of the need to move the match to a neutral venue due to unavoidable circumstances,” it said in a statement on Friday. The AFC did not give a reason for the cancellation and said it would be left to the relevant Fifa committees to decide on the fixture’s future. The Nikkei Asia website said the match had been moved to a yet unannounced neutral venue, while no date has been given for the fixture. The Kyodo news agency cited unspecified North Korean media reports about a “malignant infectious disease” in Japan, thought to be a reference to a potentially deadly form of group A streptococcal disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Experts in Japan have said cases of STSS will continue to spread, while officials are struggling to identify the cause. The number of cases in 2024 is expected to exceed last year’s record number after the presence of highly virulent and infectious strains were confirmed in Japan. Japan’s players and staff had planned to arrive in Pyongyang on Monday after training in Beijing, media reports said. Last month, a qualifying match for the Paris Olympics between the Japanese and North Korean women’s teams was moved from Pyongyang to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at the last minute after Japanese football authorities cited difficulties in travelling to North Korea, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Japan. The return leg of the men’s World Cup qualifier would have been the first international sports event to be held in North Korea since before the coronavirus pandemic. The regime responded to the outbreak by sealing its borders and banning foreign tourists. North Korea last hosted a men’s soccer international in Pyongyang in 2019 during the qualifying competition for the 2022 World Cup. The country later pulled out of that competition, citing health concerns related to the pandemic. North Korea is also scheduled to host World Cup qualifiers against Group B’s other two teams, Syria and Myanmar, in June.",2024-03-22 11:44:12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/north-korea-cancels-world-cup-qualifier-against-japan,The Guardian,693,north korea abruptly 2026 world cup match japan next week leaving frantically searching alternative venue north korea reportedly decided would longer host match next kim stadium day met first two group b game japan 10 kozo president japan football association told return match north capital would go ahead football confederation said match due unforeseen decision taken consultation relevant come informed 20 march democratic republic korea football association need move match neutral venue due unavoidable said statement give reason cancellation said would left relevant decide future said match yet unannounced neutral venue date given fixture news agency unspecified north medium malignant infectious disease japan thought reference potentially deadly form group streptococcal disease streptococcal toxic shock syndrome japan said continue spread struggling identify cause number 2024 exceed last record number presence highly virulent infectious confirmed japan staff arrive training medium said last month match north last minute football north korea formal diplomatic japan return leg world cup qualifier would first international sport event north korea since pandemic regime outbreak sealing banning foreign north korea last soccer international 2019 competition 2022 world cup country later competition health related pandemic north korea also host world cup group two june north korea world cup qualifier japan
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,694,"Weather tracker: Tornadoes hit central US, killing three","Last week, central parts of the US experienced a severe outbreak of tornadoes with more than two dozen forming across the states of Ohio and Indiana, resulting in at least three deaths and multiple injuries. A number of intense supercell thunderstorms travelled eastwards across central Indiana late in the afternoon and evening of 14 March, from which tornadoes formed. Many of these were weak with estimated maximum wind speeds of 65-85mph – the requirement to be categorised as an EF-0 tornado. A few were stronger, however. One initially damaged nearly half of the buildings in the small town of Selma, Indiana, before strengthening into an EF-3 tornado in Winchester. At the tornado’s peak, wind speeds of 155-165mph were estimated, with homes severely damaged and trees uprooted. The intensity then gradually decreased before it crossed into Ohio, although not without some further damage. Earlier this week, an area of low pressure propagated eastwards across Japan in conjunction with higher pressure over North and South Korea to the west, which allowed for a flow of very cold, northerly air to sink southwards across the Sea of Japan. Subsequently, snow fell widely across north-western Japan on Wednesday night. There was snow across low-lying areas, including in the city of Hikone, in the Shiga prefecture, with slight accumulations decorating the city with 2cm measured overnight. Farther inland, areas such as Nagano recorded 6cm by 6am, while there were higher accumulations in mountainous areas, with Kusatsu, within the Gunma prefecture, recording 40cm of snow within a 12-hour period by 7am on Thursday morning – breaking the record for the heaviest snowfall in March. Meanwhile, South Sudan became the next African country to witness record scorching temperatures as the heatwave is well under way, with air temperatures of 41C being recorded in the capital, Juba, on Tuesday. Little to no change is expected over the upcoming weeks with temperatures expected to peak into the low- to-mid-40s celsius every day; temperatures that are not uncommon during the summer months but rather exceptional at this time of year.",2024-03-22 11:05:58,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/22/weather-tracker-tornadoes-hit-central-us-killing-three,The Guardian,694,last week central u experienced severe outbreak two dozen forming across resulting least three multiple number intense travelled across central late afternoon evening 14 march formed many weak maximum wind 6585mph requirement ef0 tornado however one initially nearly half small town strengthening ef3 tornado peak wind 155165mph severely intensity gradually crossed although without damage week area low pressure across japan conjunction higher pressure north south korea west flow cold northerly air sink southward across sea japan subsequently snow fell widely across northwestern japan night snow across city prefecture slight city 2cm measured overnight farther inland 6cm 6am higher mountainous within prefecture recording 40cm snow within 12hour period 7am morning breaking record snowfall march meanwhile south next country witness record scorching well way air 41c capital juba little change upcoming peak low tomid40s every day uncommon summer rather exceptional time year weather tracker hit central u killing three
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,695,The Ohtani interpreter scandal reveals the grubby underbelly of sports betting,"This is Major League Baseball’s worst nightmare. The face of the league, its one, true international star, who this past offseason joined one of its biggest teams on a $700m contract, is associated with allegations around an illegal sports betting operation. The story so far: the Los Angeles Dodgers fired Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, the team’s two-way phenom, on Wednesday after an investigation revealed $4.5m in wire transfers sent from Ohtani’s bank account to a California betting organization that is now under federal investigation. Mizuhara had initially sat for an interview with ESPN, saying that Ohtani had paid the money to cover his interpreter’s gambling debts. After 24 hours, though, Ohtani’s representatives switched course, saying Mizuhara had been guilty of “massive theft,” and that the matter has been turned over to the authorities. ESPN reports that two wire transfers sent in September and October totaling $1m show Ohtani’s name. Gambling is legal in most US states, but not in California. So far, no charges have been filed in the ongoing investigation into the California book. Mizuhara says Ohtani did not place any bets himself, and the Dodgers star is not subject to any criminal or MLB investigation. Earlier on Wednesday, before the firing was announced, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred had been in attendance at the Seoul Series, two games in South Korea to mark the start of the new season. Manfred trumpeted the league’s commercial growth and its international development – there was a passing nod to the Oakland Athletics moving to Las Vegas, less than a decade removed from the stigma of gambling keeping all of the major US professional sports leagues away from The Strip. Less than 24 hours later, those three pillars of the Manfred legacy had combined and combusted. There are many unknowns to this story: how did Mizuhara have access to Ohtani’s account? How did he gain a $4.5m line of credit with bookmakers? What will the fallout be for Ohtani, one of the most famous people in Japan and one of the few MLB players familiar to non-baseball fans? What we do know, is that this is a terrible look for MLB which, like all US professional sports leagues, has rushed to embrace legal gambling. While Mizuhara’s problems stemmed from bets with an illegal bookmaker, this week’s fiasco is centered around a man with a clear gambling problem at the same time that MLB is embracing legal betting. Last year, MLB announced a partnership with FanDuel that will “bring fans’ viewing and wagering experiences closer than ever before.” Integrated, real-time gambling is coming to a sports streaming service near you soon. It’s not just MLB: on Tuesday, the NBA announced it would integrate real-time wagering into its streaming service, NBA League Pass. With the click of a remote, you wager on who grabs the next rebound, who misses the next free throw or who will win the third quarter. Needless to say, there are worrying signs that gambling addiction in the US is on the rise. “Calls to gambling helplines in most states in America are up, by sheer numbers,” Timothy Fong, co-director of the gambling studies program at UCLA, told the Guardian in December. He added that “more and more younger clients” – aged 25 and under – are seeking treatment. Around one in five (19%) adult Americans placed bets in 2022, according to research by Pew. Six percent of those placed bets on gambling apps – and 53% of those bets are placed in-game, according to CRG Global. Betting in-game juices viewership figures, and keeps those viewers hanging around for longer, allowing leagues to negotiate stronger TV rights deals, the backbone of any league’s riches. No league has embraced the in-game market more than MLB. Given baseball’s stop-start nature and the volume of MLB games – 2,430 in the regular season compared to the NFL’s 272 – there are more bets to be placed and just enough time between pitches to click an app before a user can think through the consequences. For many Americans, betting has become a daily ritual – and no sport feeds that dopamine rush as intensely as baseball. Broadcasts these days do not merely tease gambling; it’s omnipresent. You’re not there to watch the sport, to see who wins, you’re there to track your app, monitor your daily fantasy lineup and play catchup if your early innings bets have turned sour. Local broadcasts channeled through cable affiliates are drenched in gambling talk. There are lineup cards in partnership with FanDuel. Pitching matchups presented by BetMGM. A sport ostensibly governed and run by data wonks is not trying to deliver information to its audience; it’s trying to coerce viewers to part with their money, and MLB doesn’t seem inclined to stop any of it. Whereas leagues like the Premier League, based in England, have taken steps to curb the visualization of gambling, in baseball it’s ever-present. Fears over the league’s long-term commercial viability – with an ageing fanbase and collapsing regional broadcasters – has driven the game to clutch gambling as a life preserver. And, in economic terms, it’s worked. As baseball has become increasingly beholden to the gambling barons, interest in baseball has risen among younger demographics. The idea is basic: Take a sport tailor-made for in-game betting, place access to games and sportsbooks in the hands of young people through smartphones, and watch your ratings and revenue soar. It doesn’t appear to matter that one out of 10 US college students is a pathological gambler, according to an analysis from the University of Buffalo. For those at the ballpark, in-play betting is still viable: beyond the apps, seven MLB stadiums have a licensed sportsbook or sportsbook lounge. The sport no longer invites you to wager. It doesn’t just expect it. It’s a dictum: if you’re following along, you better have some juice on the outcome. It’s no wonder, then, that given the landscape, baseball would reach this day. One of the most famous events in the game’s history is based around a game-fixing scandal. More recently, in the legal gambling era, we’ve seen cockamamy schemes from Iowa baseball players and Brad Bohannon, the former Alabama college baseball coach, to try to cheat the system and the game. When you invite in the gambling vultures, few sports are so ripe for the danger of addiction, corruption and wrongdoing than baseball.",2024-03-22 09:00:33,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/22/mlb-embraced-betting-now-its-smeared-with-gamblings-grubby-underbelly,The Guardian,695,major league worst nightmare face league one true international star past one biggest 700m contract associated around illegal sport betting operation story far fired interpreter investigation revealed 45m wire sent bank account betting organization federal investigation initially sat interview saying money cover gambling 24 though switched course saying guilty massive theft matter turned two wire sent 1m show name gambling legal u far ongoing investigation book place star subject criminal investigation firing commissioner rob attendance series two south korea mark start new season commercial growth international development passing nod athletics moving la le decade removed stigma gambling keeping major u professional sport away strip le 24 later three legacy combined many story access account gain 45m line credit one famous people japan one familiar know terrible look like u professional sport rushed embrace legal gambling stemmed illegal bookmaker fiasco centered around man clear gambling problem time embracing legal betting last year partnership bring wagering closer ever gambling coming sport streaming service near soon would integrate wagering streaming service league pas click remote wager next rebound next free throw win third quarter needle say worrying gambling addiction u rise gambling sheer timothy codirector gambling program told guardian added younger aged 25 seeking treatment around one five 19 adult 2022 according research pew six percent gambling 53 according global betting hanging around longer negotiate backbone rich league market given nature volume 2430 regular season 272 enough time click user think many betting become daily ritual sport rush intensely baseball day merely tease gambling omnipresent watch sport see track monitor daily fantasy play catchup early turned sour local channeled cable gambling talk partnership pitching sport ostensibly run data trying deliver information audience trying coerce part money doesnt seem stop whereas like premier league based taken curb visualization gambling baseball commercial viability regional driven game clutch gambling life preserver economic worked baseball become increasingly beholden gambling interest baseball risen among younger idea basic take sport betting place access young people watch revenue soar doesnt appear matter one 10 u college pathological gambler according analysis university buffalo betting still viable beyond seven licensed lounge sport longer wager doesnt expect dictum following along better juice outcome wonder given landscape baseball would reach day one famous history based around scandal recently legal gambling era weve seen baseball brad former college baseball coach try cheat system game invite gambling sport ripe danger addiction corruption wrongdoing baseball interpreter scandal grubby underbelly sport betting
FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,696,"Putin is a dictator and a tyrant, but other forces sustain him – and the west needs to understand them | Simon Jenkins","The west’s derisive reporting of Vladimir Putin’s election victory this week was a mark of his success. It was described as an abuse of democracy, “rigged”, “fixed” and “a sham”. The other candidates were shadows, while Putin’s true opponents were imprisoned, exiled or dead. According to this narrative, the 87% who voted for him were mere victims of coercion, the queues of silent protesters were the stars. Putin’s vote had nothing to do with democracy. It was a rerun of his 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, a global dressing-up, a rallying of support. As he celebrated his win to an adoring crowd in Red Square on Monday, we saw Putin as the new Ivan the Terrible against a backdrop of Ivan’s St Basil’s cathedral. He even made an offhand quip about his murdered rival Navalny. The image was of absolute power smilingly defying the enemy. Two years ago, he was supposedly crippled by western sanctions. We don’t hear that now. I sometimes think what fun it would be to spend a month as the London correspondent for a totalitarian state newspaper. The evidence of relentless failures by the British government would fuel my daily contrasts with the order and stability back home. I would ponder when these bickering politicians and their corrupt donors would fade to nothing. I would report on the excluded populists – the Johnsons, Andersons, Farages and Galloways – waiting in the wings to pounce, while Rishi Sunak twists and turns frantically to avoid an election. How we describe other countries matters when our concern is not how it seems to them, but how it feels to us. Almost half a century of George Kennan’s policy of containment and cohabitation with communism has given way to a shrill new agenda. Not just Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Syria, but states across Asia and Africa are regularly castigated as tyrannical, terrorist or genocidal. They are made victims of economic aggression through sanctions, distorting global trade and impoverishing millions. There is no evidence this castigation has advanced the cause of democracy an inch – quite the opposite. One survey suggests the number of democracies has declined since 2015. Political bookshelves heave with predictions of democracy’s decay and death. Most alarming was last year’s polling from Open Society Foundations. Surveying nations across the globe, it found that only 57% of 18 to 35s regarded democracy as their preferred form of government, against more than 70% for those over 56. Each successive younger generation has a lower respect for democracy. More than a third of the world’s under-35s would today support some sort of “military rule”, by a “strong leader” who did not hold elections or consult a parliament. When I asked a Russia expert what he thought would be the true tally of electoral support for Putin’s dictatorship, his view squared with this survey. He suggested it would be about 60%, though lower in Moscow and St Petersburg. This sounded much like my visits to Moscow in the post-communist 1990s. Russians would concede the virtues of western democracy, but they pleaded the more urgent need for order, security and prosperity. To vote for Putin, you did not need to support his regime or his war with Ukraine. You might well be content with the one thing he promises: security and a patriotic response to western abuse. Nato’s escalation of its logistical aid to Ukraine into an all-out economic war on the Russian people enabled Putin to construct an anti-west coalition. It now extends from China and India to embrace a stage army of authoritarians across the globe. This economic war has clearly been counter-productive. The Economist reports this week that the sanctions have in fact “juiced the [Russian] economy”. Russian GDP growth of approximately 3 % in real terms last year outstripped Britain’s. Western policy is actively helping Putin retain power. As the historian of modern Russia Mark Galeotti points out, Putin’s defiance of his western critics has entrenched his “shabby police state”, possibly for his lifetime. We can hurl abuse at him, as we can at Xi, Modi and the rest. It may make us feel better. And perhaps we should, not least on moral grounds: these are not regimes we would cast as admirable. But let’s be realistic. There is not the slightest evidence that in doing so we are making the world a safer place for democracy; probably the reverse.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,697,Australia 2-0 Lebanon: World Cup qualifier – as it happened,"Here is Joey Lynch’s report from CommBank Stadium in Parramatta: Australia has now played three games on the road to the 2026 Fifa World Cup. They have emerged triumphant in all three games and after their 2-0 win over Lebanon, they already have one foot in the third round of Asian World Cup qualifying. But the victory over the Cedars in Sydney’s West has extracted a significant price on Graham Arnold’s side. Thank you for joining me tonight. We’ll be back here to do it all again on Tuesday, this time for a Lebanon “home” fixture from Canberra. I’ll see you then. It devolved into a tricky game to appraise. For the first half-hour or so Australia looked well drilled, urgent, and worth their 1-0 lead. But as the game wore on the Socceroos lost their rhythm and Lebanon grew in belief. By the end the visitors were the more likely side to score. Despite bossing possession the Socceroos created few clear chances and there was no shortage of fortune about both goals. Adam Taggart will be disappointed with his night’s work after being repeatedly caught offside and failing to execute an assured first touch as shooting opportunities unfolded. Ajdin Hrustic shone amongst the chaos, but his free roaming role drifting in from the right played its own part in the unstructured second half, one in which Keanu Baccus was increasingly isolated at the base of midfield. Earlier injuries to Riley McGree and Jordy Bos disrupted what was already an experimental line-up. “We can do better,” bemoans Connor Metcalfe immediately after the final whistle. Adding, “sloppy… individual errors… it’s not easy switching between systems.” Much to Australia’s relief, the referee blows the whistle for full-time. Two-nil, three points, three wins from three in this stage of qualifying, but that was not a convincing performance from the Socceroos. 90+5 mins: Darwich takes it – and it draws a tremendous diving save from Ryan away to his left. Lebanon keep the ball alive and the cross is hurled over for Lajud to glance wide! 90+4 mins: Handball against Hrustic right on the edge of Australia’s box. Lebanon with a decent set-piece opportunity to snatch a consolation goal. 90+3 mins: Australia’s inability to retain possession in midfield has become a chronic issue late in the game. Better opposition would have punished them for it by now. 90+2 mins: Just five minutes of stoppage time for Australia to navigate and they can look ahead to Tuesday’s return fixture. 90+1 mins: The corner is dangerous but Matar does well to punch the second effort clear. Baccus keeps the opportunity alive and eventually Metcalfe drills a sweetly struck effort straight at the keeper. 90 mins: Irvine has a clear sight of goal running with the ball into the penalty area, but his sidef-ooted effort is deflected wide of the post and out for a corner. 88 mins: Iredale has a decent shot from range that’s saved comfortably. Australia haven’t had too many efforts on goal tonight. 85 mins: Superb lone-striker play from Duke, leaping to win the clearance then finding Metcalfe with the second ball, but the cross is poor and cleared easily. Lebanon are playing with belief now. Probably too little too late, but they’re making Australia scrap in these closing stages. 83 mins: That was a major scare for Australia who have lost control of the physical and tactical battle in the past 10-15 minutes. Lebanon’s substitutes have made an impact and the stop-start nature of the game has robbed the Socceroos of any fluidity. 81 mins: Australia break out of defence but Irvine doesn’t free Hrustic bursting through the middle. Instead the skipper retains possession and the ball is rolled across the Socceroos defence… but Burgess takes his eye off the ball and red shirts swarm around him. Lebanon have numbers, and fashion a chance for Lajud – who curls an effort against the inside of Ryan’s near post! So so close for the visitors. 79 mins: Decent effort from Lebanon who work the ball out of congestion on the right for Lajud to have a lash on goal but his swipe skews well wide. Omar Bugiel and Ali Sisi replaced by Karim Darwiche and Nader Matar 78 mins: Now Baccus is booked for legging Haidar. The opening goalscorer will now be suspended for Tuesday’s clash. This match is no longer a thing of beauty. 76 mins: Good effort for a school night. 2️⃣7️⃣,0️⃣2️⃣6️⃣ at @commbankstadium tonight for #AUSvLBN 🏟️#Socceroos #DifferentBreed pic.twitter.com/7Jgef1z0zI 74 mins: Gorgeous outside-of-the-left-boot flick from Hrustic into the right channel, but Duke is offside in pursuit of it. There is a touch of class in the playmaker that nobody else in Australia is currently capable of. If the Socceroos are to progress against better opponents Arnold is going to need to figure out a formation that allows Hrustic to flourish. 73 mins: Ryan finds Atkinson with an early throw but the fullback eschews the angled run of Duke in favour of a long hopeful whack to the isolated Metcalfe. Lebanon clear. 71 mins: News from ptichiside is that Jordy Bos’s knee injury doesn’t appear too serious, which is excellent to hear. Meanwhile the scrappiness continues out on the field. 69 mins: Australia have lost those patterns of play that served them so well in the first half. The game is becoming increasingly fractured and reliant on individual moments. 67 mins: It’s subs o’clock in Parramatta with both sides making changes. The Socceroos elect to replace their forward line with Duke and Iredale coming on for Yengi and Taggart. While for Lebanon Hassan Maatouk is replaced by Daniel Lajud. 66' | Substitution: Our final changes.⬆️ Duke, Iredale⬇️ Yengi, Taggart🇦🇺 2-0 🇱🇧#AUSvLBN #Socceroos #DifferentBreed 65 mins: Australia finally find some timing and isolate Metcalfe one-on-one on the left. He goes outside his marker but then overhits his cross. 64 mins: It’s all got a bit scrappy again with neither side able to assert any control in midfield. 61 mins: Well, Martin, it very nearly did! From a very narrow angle Ryan is forced into his first acrobatic save of the night, forcing the ball clear at full stretch from a fierce Tneich drive. Nathaniel Atkinson is then booked for making slight contact in midfield. Lebanon’s propensity to go to ground is not endearing them to me. 60 mins: Cometh the hour, cometh the man. That man is Martin Turnbull: “Not a bad game to date. Shame about Bos. Lebanon are an extremely limited side. Hope that doesn’t come back to bite me!” 58 mins: As if scripted, another example materialises when Hrustic conjures an impudent flick on the edge of the box to unpick the Lebanon defence, but Taggart is not alert to the moment and his touch evades him yet again. 56 mins: Lebanon will have to come out of their shell now and allow Australia more room to play. Hrustic anticipates just that and picks out the running Taggart (onside this time) but the striker’s layoff to Atkinson misses its target. Taggart has got through a power of work tonight but his touch has been found wanting often. And from the resulting corner Australia go 2-0 up! The corner to the near post comes off a bundle of bodies and drops to the feet of Kye Rowles. He swings a left boot at the ball like a novice golfer might a driver, and he makes solid enough connection to slice the ball awkwardly in off the near post. 53 mins: Haidar wins a free-kick on halfway on the left but instead of turning it into an attack the ball is played all the way back to the goalkeeper. The Socceroos pounce, force the turnover and Irvine has a snapshot deflected into the side-netting. 51 mins: Australia have dominated possession since the break, calmly keeping the ball out of Lebanon’s reach. For the time being the Cedars are happy to sit in and hold their shape. 49 mins: … once more for luck! Hrustic to Taggart through on the goal but there’s no end product because the forward didn’t bend his run enough before accepting possession. Three near identical incidents in a matter of seconds. 49 mins: … and again! Hrustic to Taggart, the crowd anticipates a shot but the flag is up for offside. 49 mins: Hrustic again, switching from touchline to touchline to open the play and find Metcalfe, then slipping Taggart through with a delightful pass only for the Perth Glory striker to be caught offside. 47 mins: Hrustic is quickly into the game, drifting in from the right and lofting a cross that almost reaches the poised Yengi. 46 mins: A change for Lebanon at the break with attacking midfielder Mohamad Haidar coming on for the more defensively minded Hasan Srour. The teams are back out in Parramatta ready for the second half. The Socceroos take a slender lead into the break. Their performance has been bright and energetic but they have created very little in front of goal for all their endeavour. The first-half headline may yet prove to be the injuries to McGree and Bos that forced both left-sided attackers off the field. 45+4 mins: Both sides fail to find their intended targets with crucial passes as the game suddenly opens up. It’s all become fractured towards the end of the half. 45+2 mins: Australia break swiftly and free Metcalfe on the left but he dwells on his cross and a red shirt flies across to deflect the ball behind. The corner leads to nothing. 45 mins: Sabra’s down again. He doesn’t need to be. 43 mins: Hrustic has actually entered on the right side of midfield with Metcalfe switching to the left. 42 mins: Australia call on their third left-sided attacker of the night with Ajdin Hrustic replacing Jordy Bos. Fingers crossed neither Bos nor McGree are badly injured. 40 mins: Chaaban goes down theatrically in the box, but there’s nothing doing. Then the follow-up shot needs saving low to his left by Ryan. Lebanon’s first look at goal for the night. Meanwhile, Bos is back down on the turf shaking his head. That knee injury looks to be forcing him off. 38 mins: … not just into the fray but whipping in a gorgeous left-footed cross from the touchline that is begging to be thumped home by either striker, only for it to evade both Taggart and Yengi. 36 mins: But Arnie will not be happy to see another left-sided attacker down injured. Bos landed heavily in a shoulder-to-shoulder clash in the left corner and at first it looked like he could have done himself a serious mischief, but he’s eventually back to his feet and into the fray.",2024-03-21 11:36:09,https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2024/mar/21/australia-vs-lebanon-socceroos-world-cup-qualifier-live-updates-scores-results-lineups-start-time-commbank-stadium-sydney-parramatta,The Guardian,697,joey report stadium three road 2026 world cup triumphant three 20 win already one foot third round world cup victory west extracted significant price graham side thank joining tonight well back time home fixture ill see tricky game appraise first well urgent worth 10 lead game wore lost rhythm grew belief end likely side score despite bossing possession clear shortage fortune disappointed night work repeatedly caught failing execute assured first touch shooting unfolded shone amongst chaos free roaming role drifting right part second half one increasingly isolated base riley already experimental better immediately final whistle sloppy … individual … easy switching much relief referee whistle three three three stage convincing performance 905 tremendous diving save away left keep ball alive cross hurled glance wide 904 handball right edge box decent opportunity snatch consolation goal 903 inability retain possession become chronic issue late game better opposition would 902 five stoppage time navigate look ahead return fixture 901 corner dangerous well punch second effort clear opportunity alive eventually sweetly struck effort straight keeper 90 clear sight goal running ball penalty area effort deflected wide post corner 88 decent shot range thats saved comfortably havent many goal tonight 85 superb play duke leaping win clearance finding second ball cross poor easily belief probably little late theyre making scrap 83 major scare lost control physical tactical battle past 1015 made impact nature game fluidity 81 break defence doesnt free middle instead skipper possession ball rolled across defence … burgess eye ball red swarm around fashion chance effort inside near post close 79 decent effort work ball congestion right lash goal swipe well wide sisi 78 booked legging opening suspended clash match longer thing beauty 76 good effort school night 2 ️⃣ 7 ️⃣ 0 ️⃣ 2 ️⃣ 6 ️⃣ tonight 🏟️ pictwittercom7jgef1z0zi 74 gorgeous flick right channel duke pursuit touch class playmaker nobody else currently capable progress better going need figure formation flourish 73 early throw fullback angled run duke long hopeful whack isolated clear 71 news bos knee injury doesnt appear serious excellent hear meanwhile scrappiness field 69 lost play well first half game becoming increasingly reliant individual 67 oclock side making elect replace forward line duke coming 66 substitution final ⬆️ duke ⬇️ 🇦🇺 20 🇱🇧 65 finally find timing isolate left go outside marker cross 64 got bit scrappy neither side able assert control 61 well martin nearly narrow angle forced first acrobatic save night forcing ball clear full stretch fierce drive booked making slight contact propensity go ground endearing 60 hour man man martin bad game date shame extremely limited side hope doesnt come back bite 58 another example impudent flick edge box unpick defence alert moment touch yet 56 come shell allow room play running onside time layoff target got power work tonight touch found wanting often resulting corner go 20 corner near post come bundle left boot ball like novice golfer might driver solid enough connection slice ball awkwardly near post 53 halfway left instead turning attack ball way back goalkeeper pounce force turnover snapshot deflected 51 dominated possession since break calmly keeping ball reach time happy sit hold shape 49 … luck goal there end product forward didnt bend run enough possession three near identical matter 49 … crowd shot flag 49 switching touchline touchline open play find slipping delightful pas glory striker caught 47 quickly game drifting right lofting cross almost poised 46 change break coming defensively minded hasan back ready second half take slender lead break performance bright energetic little front goal headline may yet prove forced field 454 side fail find intended crucial game suddenly become towards end half 452 break free left cross red shirt across deflect ball behind corner nothing 45 doesnt need 43 actually right side switching left 42 call third attacker night crossed neither badly injured 40 go theatrically box there nothing shot need saving low left first look goal night meanwhile back turf shaking head knee injury forcing 38 … fray whipping gorgeous cross touchline begging home either striker evade 36 happy see another attacker injured landed heavily clash left corner first like could done serious mischief eventually back fray 20 world cup qualifier
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,698,Translator for Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani’s fired after allegations of ‘massive theft’,"The interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, the biggest star in baseball and one of the most famous people in Japan, has been fired after lawyers for the player said there had been a “massive theft” from the slugger’s account. ESPN reported that several sources said Ippei Mizuhara had run up large debts to a Californian bookmaker. Initially a spokesperson for the player said Ohtani had transferred $4.5m to cover Mizuhara’s debts. But when ESPN asked further questions, the spokesperson backed away from their claim and said Ohtani’s lawyers would soon make a statement. “In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft, and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,” read the statement from Berk Brettler LLP on Wednesday. Mizuhara told ESPN on Wednesday he had been instructed not to comment on the matter but did not say where those instructions had come from. Sports betting is legal in most US states but is still outlawed in California, where Ohtani plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers. MLB players and staff are allowed to bet on sports other than baseball but are forbidden from gambling with illegal bookmakers. Any violation of the rules would leave players or staff subject to punishment from the MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred. There is no suggestion that Ohtani has ever gambled himself. Mizuhara had initially said on Tuesday that Ohtani had helped him cover the gambling debts and ESPN saw two documents containing payments of $500,000 in Ohtani’s name from September and October. ESPN reports the payments were made to an associate of Mathew Bowyer, whose bookmaking operation is under investigation by federal investigators. Bowyer’s attorney, Diane Bass, told ESPN: “Mr Bowyer never met or spoke with Shohei Ohtani.” Mizuhara said on Tuesday, before Wednesday’s developments, that Ohtani had nothing to do with the betting itself. “Obviously, he [Ohtani] wasn’t happy about [the debt] and said he would help me out to make sure I never do this again,” Mizuhara said. “He decided to pay it off for me. I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting. I want people to know I did not know this was illegal. I learned my lesson the hard way. I will never do sports betting ever again.” Mizuhara added that he had never bet on baseball. “I never bet on baseball,” Mizuhara said. “That’s 100%. I knew that rule ... We have a meeting about that in spring training.” Ohtani and Mizuhara are close friends beyond their working relationship. Mizuhara has been Ohtani’s translator since the star moved from Japan to play for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani joined the Dodgers in December on a 10-year, $700m deal. He made his Dodgers debut on Wednesday in a victory over the San Diego Padres in South Korea, and is hugely popular in Japan. ESPN said MLB is investigating the case. The Dodgers have yet to comment.",2024-03-20 22:55:11,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/20/mlb-star-shohei-ohtanis-translator-fired-after-allegations-of-massive-theft,The Guardian,698,interpreter biggest star baseball one famous people japan fired player said massive theft account several said run large bookmaker initially player said transferred 45m cover backed away claim said would soon make statement course recent medium discovered victim massive theft turning matter read statement told instructed comment matter say come sport betting legal u still staff bet sport baseball forbidden gambling illegal violation would leave staff subject punishment commissioner rob suggestion ever initially said cover gambling saw two 500000 name made associate bowyer whose bookmaking operation investigation federal attorney bass told bowyer never met spoke said nothing betting obviously wasnt happy debt said would help make sure never said decided pay want everyone know zero involvement betting want people know know illegal learned lesson hard way never sport betting ever added never bet baseball never bet baseball said thats 100 knew rule meeting spring training close beyond working relationship translator since star japan play 2018 10year 700m deal made debut victory san south korea hugely popular japan said investigating case yet comment translator star fired massive theft
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,699,Japan v North Korea World Cup qualifier resumes rivalry that extends beyond football,"A place at the next football World Cup is not all that is at stake when Japan and North Korea meet on Thursday for the first of two qualifying matches, in a resumption of one of the fiercest rivalries in international football. Despite the huge gap between the countries’ economies and the profiles of their domestic leagues, few expect the match at Tokyo’s national stadium to be a walkover for the Japanese, who are 18th in the Fifa rankings, 96 places above their opponents. Meetings between the two countries have always been about more than football. On one side, a former colonial power allied to Pyongyang’s arch-enemy, the US; on the other, a dictatorship that has sent ballistic missiles over Japan and abducted dozens of its citizens. Pundits expect the Samurai Blue to win in front of a highly partisan crowd, but they will be in unfamiliar, hostile territory five days later for the return leg at the 50,000-seat Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang. With a week to go before kick-off for that second match, it was not clear if North Korean supporters – mainly military and party elites – would be allowed to attend. Geopolitics is never far away when the two teams meet. The qualifiers for the 2026 tournament, co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, come soon after the North test-launched short-range ballistic missiles and the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, oversaw a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable rocket launchers designed to target Seoul. The country’s million-strong army, Kim said this week, should “prepare for war”. The visiting players, who were permitted to travel as an exception to sanctions barring North Koreans from entering Japan, will not be without support. Among the expected 68,000 crowd will be several thousand members of Japan’s 150,000-strong North Korean community, many of whom are descended from people forcibly brought to work in Japan during Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula. The 4,000 tickets for seats in the North Korean section of the stadium sold out immediately, while the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan – North Korea’s de facto embassy – urged ethnic minority zainichi Koreans with connections to the North to cheer for the visitors. Risa Ho, an ethnic North Korean living in Tokyo, said she would be supporting the visitors on Thursday. “I love Japanese footballers and I usually support Japan, but not when they play North Korea,” said Ho, who will be in the crowd at the national stadium. “It’s complicated, and I feel a little bit conflicted, but when it comes to the national team I want to support North Korea,” added Ho, who predicted some frank exchanges between rival supporters on Thursday. “The political backdrop means these games always have an edge.” As for the result, Ho predicted a 2-1 win for Japan, but believed North Korea would still make the World Cup finals. “North Korea is putting a lot of effort into improving its sports teams, and that includes football,” she said, adding that Kim, known for his love of NBA basketball, also followed football. North Korea have historically punched well above their weight in international football. At the 1966 World Cup in England, the unknown team stunned Italy with a 1-0 win in a decisive group match, only to be beaten 5-3 by Portugal in the quarter-final after leading 3-0. Their record against Japan suggests that the results of the two games are far from fait accompli for the Samurai Blue, who began their World Cup campaign with comfortable wins over Asian minnows Syria and Myanmar. In the two countries’ 20 meetings since 1975, the men’s senior teams have each won eight and drawn four. Previous fixtures between North Korea and Japan have occasionally seen the mutual animosity spill over on to the pitch. The Japan U-23’s 2-1 victory over the North at the Asian Games last October was marred when members of the losing team clashed with match officials and security staff. “I admit that our players were a little bit over-excited in the match, but that’s football,” North Korea’s coach, Sin Yong Nam, said afterwards. “But there are confrontations in football matches … I think our behaviour was acceptable.” When the countries’ women’s teams played each other in Tokyo last month, North Korean fans turned a section of the stadium into a blanket of red, with some waving flags urging their players to “protect the dignity of the republic” – a reference to North Korea’s official name the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Like other athletes from the secretive country, the players were confined to their accommodation, training ground and stadium, and banned from speaking to Japanese or South Koreans, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Contests between Korean and Japanese teams can summon mixed emotions among younger ethnic Koreans in Japan. “I was born and brought up in Japan, so to be honest, I knew the Japan players’ names and faces better than the DPRK players from seeing them on TV,” An Yong-hak, a former North Korean international, told Agence France-Presse this week. “But I am an ethnic Korean, and my name is An Yong-hak. I thought of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as my national team, and I always worked hard with that in mind.” As North Korea attempt to qualify for their first World Cup since 2010, An attempted to play down the historical and political tensions that have made this one of the qualifying rounds’ most anticipated matches. Recalling his team’s injury-time defeat against Japan in a World Cup qualifier in 2006, he held out hope that, whatever the result on Thursday, fair play will prevail. “After that game we all shook hands and waved to the Japanese fans,” An said. “It was a great game that went beyond the result, and I hope this time is the same.” Agencies contributed reporting",2024-03-20 15:30:39,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/20/japan-north-korea-rivalry-extends-beyond-football,The Guardian,699,place next football world cup stake japan north korea meet first two resumption one international football despite huge gap domestic expect match national stadium walkover 18th 96 two always football one side former colonial power allied archenemy u dictatorship sent ballistic japan expect samurai blue win front highly partisan crowd unfamiliar hostile territory five day later return leg 50000seat kim stadium week go kickoff second match clear north mainly military party would attend geopolitics never far away two meet 2026 tournament u canada come soon north ballistic leader kim drill rocket designed target army kim said week prepare war visiting permitted travel exception barring north entering japan without support among 68000 crowd several thousand 150000strong north community many people forcibly brought work japan 191045 peninsula 4000 north section stadium sold immediately general association japan north de embassy ethnic minority north cheer ho ethnic north living said would supporting love usually support japan play north korea said ho crowd national stadium complicated feel little bit come national team want support north korea added ho frank rival political backdrop always edge result ho 21 win japan north korea would still make world cup north korea lot effort improving sport football said kim known love basketball also football north korea historically well weight international football 1966 world cup unknown team 10 win decisive group match beaten 53 leading 30 record japan two far samurai blue world cup campaign comfortable two 20 since 1975 senior eight drawn four previous north korea japan occasionally seen mutual animosity spill pitch japan u23s 21 victory north last losing team match security staff admit little bit match thats football north coach sin nam said afterwards football … think behaviour acceptable last month north turned section stadium blanket red waving urging protect dignity republic reference north official name democratic republic korea like secretive country confined accommodation training ground stadium speaking south according newspaper summon mixed among younger ethnic japan born brought japan honest knew japan better seeing former north international told week ethnic name thought democratic republic korea national team always worked hard mind north korea attempt qualify first world cup since 2010 play historical political made one defeat japan world cup qualifier 2006 hope whatever result fair play prevail game shook waved said great game went beyond result hope time japan v north korea world cup qualifier rivalry beyond football
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,700,‘Social media is like driving with no speed limits’: the US surgeon general fighting for youngsters’ happiness,"It was the hush that worried the US’s top doctor as he toured the country’s university campuses last year. Dr Vivek Murthy went to places including Duke, University of Texas and Arizona State, but so many youngsters were plugged into earphones and gazing into laptops and phones that it was incredibly quiet in the communal areas. Where was the loud chatter Murthy remembered from his college days? “Students said to me, ‘how are we supposed to start a conversation?’” the US surgeon general told the Guardian. “It’s just not the culture any more to talk to one another. It’s an indictment of the trends that we’ve seen.” Figures published on Wednesday reveal one possible impact of that screen obsession: for the first time since the data was first collected in 2012, 15- to 24-year-olds in North America say they are less happy than older generations. The gap is closing in western European nations and in March Murthy flew to London to further his campaign against falling levels of happiness, particularly among the young. He is also worried about youth wellbeing in Japan, South Korea and India. The replacement of person-to-person social connection, whether through clubs, sports teams, volunteering or faith groups, is a particular concern to the Yorkshire-born medic. Education, housing and transport initiatives that do not focus on improving wellbeing are also a worry. But perhaps the biggest problem in his opinion is the explosion of social media use, which has caused “extraordinary harms”. It is notable that Murthy is focusing so hard on this social issue. At a conference at the LSE in London on Monday, academics and researchers in the fast-developing field of wellbeing science gave him a standing ovation. There are clear physical impacts of misery for world leaders to consider. Social disconnection in the US has led to “a 29% increase in the risk of heart disease, a 32% increase in the risk of stroke and a 50% increase in the risk of dementia among older individuals,” he said. Last year, Murthy, who was first appointed to his role by Barack Obama and again by Joe Biden, issued a formal US-wide warning that social media presented “a profound risk of harm” to the mental health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. “We do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe” for them to use, it said. “I’m still waiting for companies to show us data that tells us that their platforms are actually safe,” he added. He compared tech companies to 20th-century car giants producing vehicles without seatbelts and airbags until legislation mandated it. “What’s happening in social media is the equivalent of having children in cars that have no safety features and driving on roads with no speed limits,” he said. “No traffic lights and no rules whatsoever. And we’re telling them: ‘you know what, do your best – figure out how to manage it.’ It is insane if you think about it.” The result is that parents feel “this whole thing [managing the impact of social media] has been dumped on their shoulders”. Murthy said that between 2000 and 2020 there has been a 70% decrease in the amount of in-person time young people in the US spent with their friends. Meanwhile, “our recent data is telling us that adolescents are spending on average 4.8 hours a day on social media … a third of adolescents are staying up till midnight or later on weeknights on their devices”. Last Sunday, he met with a group of young people in a park in west London and concluded their phones were feeding them a diet of “headlines that are constantly telling them that the world is broken, and that the future is bleak”. “And they said: you receive that again and again and again. You start to internalise that. You sort of lose a sense of hope.” He is interested, too, in how burgeoning social media use fuels “hustle culture” that teaches young people that they ought to build a “personal brand” and even an income stream alongside studying and growing up. “I ask [young people] what hustle culture is telling you success is,” he said. “They say some version of fame, followers and fortune. I have had too many young people say what they feel like they’ve really got to do right now is build their brand. And they don’t say that ironically.” He said social media companies should limit or eliminate “features that try to get kids to drive towards other people liking, reposting and commenting on their posts”, such as buttons and infinite scroll mechanisms that can be addictive, damage self-esteem and erode time available for other activities. “The platforms have the power to do that,” he said. Governments have been slow to install mandatory guardrails on social media platforms and should have done so 10 years ago, he said. “What has happened is a fundamental failure of governments to protect young people from the harmful effects of a new technology and it’s not new any more.” To counteract the trend, Murthy wants governments to start measuring their policies in terms of their impact on real world social connection. “Think about policies that carve up our cities and towns with highways and roadways and separate us from one another,” he said. “Think about the power of policy to actually put public transportation in place and bring people back together. Housing design can have a powerful impact on how people come together.” In 2021, the leader of the UK opposition, Keir Starmer, said a Labour government would weigh spending plans based on their effect on wellbeing in addition to national income. But for now he compares the status quo with social media to a doctor being allowed to run a hospital where floors are so slippery that people fall and break their hips, patients suffer blood clots because medicine is not being administered and become infected because dirty equipment is being used. His point is it would not happen. Protections are needed immediately, he said. “If you’ve got a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old, you don’t have three to five years to wait,” he said. “Our kids’ childhoods are happening right now. I worry that there isn’t enough of a sense of urgency in government.”",2024-03-20 00:01:36,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/20/vivek-murthy-us-surgeon-general-social-media-youth-happiness,The Guardian,700,hush worried top doctor university last year went duke university state many plugged gazing incredibly quiet communal loud chatter college day said supposed start conversation u surgeon general told guardian culture talk one another indictment weve seen reveal one possible impact screen obsession first time since data first collected 2012 15 24yearolds north say le happy older gap western march flew campaign falling happiness particularly among young also worried youth japan south korea replacement social connection whether sport faith particular concern medic education housing transport focus improving also worry perhaps biggest problem opinion explosion social medium use extraordinary notable hard social issue conference field science gave standing ovation clear physical misery world consider social disconnection u led 29 increase risk heart disease 32 increase risk stroke 50 increase risk dementia among older said last year first role joe formal warning social medium profound risk harm mental health yet enough evidence determine social medium sufficiently safe use said still waiting show u data u actually safe added tech 20thcentury car without legislation whats happening social medium equivalent safety driving speed said traffic whatsoever telling know best figure manage insane think result feel whole thing impact social medium said 2000 2020 70 decrease amount time young people u spent meanwhile recent data telling u spending average 48 day social medium … third till midnight later last met group young people park west feeding diet constantly telling world broken future bleak said receive start sort lose sense hope interested social medium use hustle culture young people ought build personal brand even income stream alongside growing ask young people hustle culture telling success said say version fame fortune many young people say feel like really got right build brand dont say ironically said social medium limit eliminate try get drive towards people liking button infinite scroll damage erode time available power said slow install mandatory social medium done 10 ago said fundamental failure protect young people harmful effect new technology new counteract trend start measuring impact real world social connection think carve separate u one another said think power policy actually put public transportation place bring people back together housing design powerful impact people come together 2021 leader opposition said labour government would weigh spending based effect addition national income status quo social medium doctor run hospital slippery people fall break suffer blood medicine become infected dirty equipment used point would happen immediately said youve got 12yearold 15yearold dont three five wait said happening right worry enough sense urgency government social medium like driving speed u surgeon general fighting happiness
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,701,Czech Republic to deliver thousands of extra artillery shells to Ukraine,"The Czech Republic says it is on the verge of delivering thousands of extra artillery shells to Ukraine, just weeks after it announced an initiative to source the much-needed supplies from outside the EU. Its foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said it had so far secured 300,000 shells and that the ammunition would provide a vital “few months’ breathing space” on the frontline. Sources added that the first deliveries would come before June. “We have a direct experience with 40 years of being a satellite of Moscow, being a country which was invaded in 1968 by Russian tanks to curb the Prague Spring,” said Lipavský, adding that his country could not stand by and watch Ukraine go without help. “No one really wants to bring back those [Soviet] times, and I have to say that the population is very sensitive to that.” Ukraine has said it is falling short of ammunition against Russia; the EU has said it expects to meet only 52% of a target set last year to deliver a million shells by March, and a bill to fund US military aid to Kyiv has been held up in Congress. Russia is ‘‘outshelling’’ Ukraine by a five-to-one ratio and Kyiv’s forces are gradually being pushed back on the battlefield. Last month Avdiivka, a frontline town, fell to the Russians after a four-month battle. Petr Pavel, the Czech president, announced the initiative at the Munich security conference in February, saying Prague had located 800,000 shells that could be obtained with funding from a consortium of western countries. The scheme works by European countries buying the shells from countries in Africa and Asia, such as South Korea, which are unwilling to supply them directly to Ukraine but happy to sell to a third party such as the Czech Republic. The munitions come from unused military stockpiles, but supplier nations are usually reluctant to be named. Czech sources said that the consortium had obtained serious pledges to supply 300,000 high-calibre artillery shells, with the first shipments being delivered no later than June. Nonbinding pledges for a further 200,000 had been made. Lipavský said the Czech Republic hope to deliver the shells “within months” to help “contain Russia’s imperialistic ambitions”, increasing speculation Ukraine could have boosted stocks from June. Lipavský said the Czechs used a combination of diplomatic and defence ministry channels to create state-to-state communications to tap supplies around the world to enable EU member states to find arms previously untapped in the war against Russia. The foreign minister said that 18 countries had committed to the initiative and they were close to raising the required funding to buy all 800,000 shells in an initiative that was partly a response the standoff in the US Congress, which is preventing the approval of a new $60bn military aid package. “I think that many European countries have realised how difficult the situation in Ukraine is,” a Czech source said. “At the same time, many European governments want to send a message to the US that we are seriously covering our share in order to encourage the US to do their share for the sake of defence of free world.” The Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Germany, and Canada have publicly confirmed their involvement. On Monday night Sweden added its name, pledging €30m, and Canada’s defence minister on Tuesday disclosed it had donated C$40 (€27m). EU leaders are separately close to agreeing a €5bn fund for Ukraine. Insiders said there was a close working relationship on arms for Ukraine between the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, and his Danish and Dutch counterparts, Mette Frederiksen and Mark Rutte. Rutte has been nominated by the US, UK and Germany to become the next head of Nato. Sign up to Headlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The three countries have so far raised €1.5bn for military supplies for Ukraine, including tanks, air aircraft systems and howitzers, and their willingness has persuaded other European nations to support them. “Ukraine has to be able to defend itself because it defends the whole Europe,” Lipavský said. “It is not [about] Ukraine losing; it is the whole western civilisation, the principles which are now at stake and which are being challenged by Russian imperialism.” He said the Czech initiative was “accelerated” two weeks after it was first announced at a summit in Paris attended by more than 20 countries. “President Macron has shown very strong leadership in recent months. I’m very happy for that […] Paris really put impetus into the whole thing,” Lipavský said. The Latvian prime minister, attending a EU summit of foreign ministers in Brussels, also said Macron’s leadership was important. Krišjānis Kariņš said Macron had inserted “strategic ambiguity” into the public discussion by suggesting troops from France had to be deployed Ukraine, which was important as a counter-narrative to undermine the Kremlin. “France sees the urgency we in the Baltics have had for the past two years. Russia will not stop, they can only be stopped. Ukraine is prepared to do the stopping but they need our assistance,” Karins added. A senior European official praised the Prague-led effort: “The Czech initiative has proven to be very very effective.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,702,Shohei Ohtani: a Japanese baseball star so loved even Koreans flock to him,"The sport is American, the venue South Korean. But when the LA Dodgers and San Diego Padres open the Major League Baseball season with two games in Seoul this week, all eyes will be on a Japanese superstar: Shohei Ohtani. It says much about Ohtani’s singular appeal that South Korean baseball fans are as excited about his imminent presence in the batter’s box at Gocheok Sky Dome as his legions of admirers in Japan. The 29-year-old is widely considered to be one of the most talented players in baseball history – a once-in-a-century phenomenon who has been compared to another figure who starred as a pitcher and a slugger: Babe Ruth. After six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, in December Ohtani signed a deal with the Dodgers that will see him eventually earn $700m – the richest contract in North American sporting history. It is no exaggeration to say that “Shotime” – twice named the American League’s most valuable player – has achieved national hero status in his native Japan since he left the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters for the Angels in 2017, following a path laid out by his illustrious predecessors Hideo Nomo and Ichiro Suzuki. Ohtani has eclipsed his yakyū compatriots to become one of the most talked about baseball players in living memory. Not even the injury to his right elbow that will keep him off the pitcher’s mound this season could dampen the sense of anticipation when the Dodgers arrived in South Korea for a series of warmups before the MLB games on Wednesday and Thursday. Not usually given to heaping praise on athletes from their great sporting rival, Japan, South Korean sports fans make an exception for Ohtani, who has reciprocated with positive posts on his Instagram account and pronounced the South “one of my favourite countries”. “The atmosphere in Korean society has often made it difficult for us to openly say we like Japan,” said Lee Jong-Sung, a sports culture expert at Hanyang University in Seoul. “I think Ohtani would perhaps be the first Japanese athlete who we can say we like. Maybe, some even consider him an honorary Korean citizen.” That was mirrored in a Korean-language post on X: “The country that Ohtani likes the most is South Korea. The Japanese who South Koreans like the most is Ohtani,” it said. The Japanese representation will not be confined to Ohtani, who will be joined by teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto – who will be making his MLB debut and is the most expensive pitcher in history – and, for the Padres, Yu Darvish and Yuki Matsui. Ohtani fever has intensified since he lead his country to victory in the last year’s World Baseball Classic, with Japan overcoming the defending champions, the US, in a 3-2 thriller. After signing his record-breaking contract with the Dodgers in December, Ohtani managed to turn an eye-popping financial reward into a positive verdict on his character, suggesting to the team’s management that he be paid most of the sum in annual increments starting in 2034 to enable them to invest in more players now. Off the field, too, he can do little wrong. A native of the north-eastern region of Japan devastated by the March 2011 triple disaster, Ohtani donated an undisclosed sum to the peninsula struck by a powerful earthquake on New Year’s Day. Last year he sent 60,000 baseball gloves to primary schools in Japan – enough for three gloves per school. Like Japanese expat athletes before him, Ohtani is pursued by an army of journalists whose reports fill the pages of sports tabloids and serious broadsheets alike. Column inches have been devoted to the latest on his elbow injury and Ohtani’s dog, Dekopin. Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer after newsletter promotion He is the public face of multiple companies, including Porsche, the sportswear maker Asics, Japan Airlines and Mitsubishi UFJ Bank. Katsuhiro Miyamoto, a professor at Kansai University, estimated that his economic impact had reached ¥50.4bn ($334m) by the end of last year, adding that it would rise to ¥64.3bn ($427m) this year if Ohtani, who was a free agent when Miyamoto’s report was published, moved to the Dodgers. “The economic impact of Ohtani’s success will be enormous,” he wrote, according to the Japan Times. “Sho fever” can sometimes reach bizarre proportions. Japanese TV cut into regular programming to report the “breaking news” of Ohtani’s surprise announcement that he had married, with his wife’s identity only made public – again to blanket media coverage – weeks later. After he became the first Japanese player to win the American League home-run title in 2023, newspapers handed out special editions and Japan Post issued commemorative stamps and postcards. Last summer, rice paddies in his hometown were transformed into a giant illustration of its famous son. The Dodgers arrived in Seoul at a rare moment of rapprochement between Japan and South Korea, whose conservative leaders have attempted to settle bitter disputes stemming from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula. Even so, few expected a Japanese athlete to enjoy these levels of adulation in South Korea, where hundreds of fans greeted the Dodgers at Incheon airport last week, shouting Ohtani’s name and holding up replica shirts. On Monday, they were out in force again, packing Gocheok Sky Dome to watch a warmup game against the South Korea national team. “He is god,” Kang Ji-ho, a baseball fan, told Agence France-Presse as he queued outside the 17,000-seat stadium, where tickets for Wednesday’s MLB opener sold out in minutes. “Japanese players are not popular in Korea, but Ohtani is different.” Ohtani has established himself as a peerless all-round ballplayer, a philanthropist and a respectful, if slightly wary, sports personality. This week he is carving out another, no less important role – that of goodwill ambassador.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,703,Central bank not ruling out further hikes – as it happened,"And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening. Here’s a wrap of what we learned today: Australian borrowers have been granted some additional breathing space today with the RBA holding interest rates steady for the third month in a row. The Albanese government has threatened to shelve two draft bills on changes to religious discrimination laws, citing concerns about divisive debate amid heightened Islamophobia and anti-semitism, unless the opposition agrees to its “balanced” approach. Mega donations of more than $1.5m would be banned under a crossbench plan to get big money out of politics. The government has quietly removed from the notice paper for this week a controversial offshore gas bill introduced by resources minister, Madeleine King. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has emphasised the ABC’s editorial independence, in response to complaints from the Ukrainian ambassador about last night’s Four Corners program spotlighting the perspective of Russian troops on the frontline. New laws are set to be introduced to Victorian parliament to force career criminals to repay any wealth that they cannot prove was lawfully acquired. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says she expects “a frank exchange of views” when she welcomes China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, to Canberra tomorrow. Energy minister Chris Bowen says today’s default market offer on electricity - with the energy regulator saying consumers can expect price cuts of up to 7.1% - is “encouraging” but that there is “a long way to go”. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) have urged the Victorian government to follow coronial recommendations and introduce a pill-testing trial at fixed and mobile sites. A second Australian men’s cricket series against Afghanistan in as many years has been postponed due to the country’s poor record on human rights for women and girls. Australia had already cancelled a one-day international series last year due to “a marked deterioration” in the treatment of women and girls. An improvement in the situation was anticipated since then and it was hoped a three-match T20 series would be given the green light to take place in August this year. But Cricket Australia on Tuesday said the conditions were getting worse rather than better and decided to again call off the series. CA made its decision after consulting with the Australian government. A statement read: The government’s advice is that conditions for women and girls in Afghanistan are getting worse. For this reason, we have maintained our previous position and will postpone the bilateral series against Afghanistan. CA continues its strong commitment to supporting participation by women and girls in cricket around the world and will continue to actively engage the International Cricket Council and work closely with the Afghanistan Cricket Board to determine what actions could be taken to support the resumption of bilateral matches in the future. Public Interest Advocacy Centre calls on Labor to keep promise to protect LGTBQ+ students and teachers The Public Interest Advocacy Centre has called on the Albanese government to keep its promise to protect LGBTQI+ students and teachers and not shelve two draft bills on changes to religious discrimination laws. Earlier today, the prime minister threatened to shelve the two draft bills, citing concerns about divisive debate amid heightened Islamophobia and anti-semitism unless the opposition agrees to its “balanced” approach. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has refused to offer any commitment before seeing the proposed legislation, describing the move on Tuesday as a “set-up” to allow Labor to dump its election commitment. The director of policy and advocacy at the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Alastair Lawrie, said: Labor went to the May 2022 federal election with clear commitments to remove the special legal privileges that allow religious schools to discriminate against students and teachers on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. The Albanese government must fulfil their promise to protect LGBTQ students and teachers in religious schools against discrimination, rather than give a veto to Mr Dutton. LGBTQ teachers, and especially students, have waited far too long already to enjoy their rights to teach and learn free from the fear of mistreatment on the basis of who they are. And that’s where we’ll leave you this evening.

Government quietly removes offshore gas approvals bill after warnings from environmental groups The government has quietly removed from the notice paper for this week a controversial offshore gas bill introduced by the resources minister, Madeleine King. The bill seeks to preserve approvals for offshore gas projects, exempting them from reassessment if environmental laws are tightened. First Nations advocates including Mardudhunera activist Raelene Cooper, environmental groups, the Greens and Senator David Pocock have all warned the bill will effectively allow the resources minister, not the environment minister, to set the rule of offshore gas approvals and water down consultation requirements. The Greens have called on Labor to withdraw the controversial amendment in return for their support for vehicle emissions standards. A spokesperson for King said: The government is continuing to engage on the bill across the parliament. We look forward to passing this important reform which will bring much needed clarity to offshore regulations. At an inquiry hearing on Thursday, departmental officials said the government was open to clarifying the intent of the bill. Asked if this was the reason the bill had been withdrawn, King’s spokesperson said: As we have said, we are open to further strengthening to give everyone confidence about the intent of the bill. If you’re just catching up on today’s news, Mike Hohnen has our top stories here in our afternoon update: Cyclone Megan downgraded to tropical low, but severe weather warning in place Ex-Tropical Cyclone Megan has been downgraded to a tropical low after crossing onto the Northern Territory, although a severe weather warning is now in place for rain and wind. Some 700 residents in the town of Borroloola faced the worst of the cyclone on Monday evening when it crossed the coast on the south-western side of the Gulf of Carpentaria as a category 1 storm. The Bureau of Meteorology said the NT had seen rainfall totals in areas in the path of the cyclone of up to 289mm in the last 24 hours to 9am on Tuesday. In the next 24 to 48 hours, a BoM spokesperson said some parts of the territory could see rainfalls of up to 300mm: While Megan has been downgraded from a tropical cyclone to a tropical low, she’s still a significant weather system that is expected to bring heavy rainfall, flooding and damaging wind gusts to the Northern Territory over the coming days. Earlier we brought you news on the Albanese government’s threat to shelve two draft bills on changes to religious discrimination laws, citing concerns about divisive debate amid heightened Islamophobia and antisemitism. If you missed it, Sarah Basford Canales has the story here: Good afternoon, everyone. I’ll now be with you until this evening. The parliament is beginning to wind down, so I will hand the blog over to Jordyn Beazley to take you through the evening. Thank you so much to everyone who joined along with us for the second day of the sitting. We will be back early Wednesday, where we will be hearing the same arguments we have been hearing for the past 10 years. Can’t wait! In the mean time, take care, A x Guiding principle on religious freedom should be whether any proposal protects people of faith, Cash says Michealia Cash has released an official statement on the religious discrimination kerfuffle: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is being unrealistic if he expects a commitment to bipartisan support for religious discrimination laws the Coalition has not even seen yet. The briefing released following the government’s caucus meeting indicates they will not proceed with changes to the laws without bipartisan support. Senator Cash: We have not seen Labor’s draft Religious Discrimination bill and we have not seen their changes to the Sex Discrimination law. It is impossible to provide bipartisan support for bills we have not seen. The Attorney-General hasn’t even released the Australian Law Reform Commission report this legislation is guided by. Stakeholders have been telling me there are some very concerning aspects to the proposed legislation. From what we are hearing, Labor’s laws will severely weaken protections for religious schools and how they operate. We are also very concerned with reports of a vilification clause, with a test set so low, it will threaten freedom of speech. This legislation must be put through a rigorous parliamentary inquiry so all Australians can understand all the issues involved. The guiding principle here should be whether any proposal the government puts forward actually protects people of faith, or whether it takes religious people and institutions backwards.” Major donor cap would apply equally to all donors, says independent Kate Chaney The independent MP, Kate Chaney, has rejected Labor’s claim the crossbench is being hypocritical on donation reform. Chaney says: Under the bill I will be introducing, a major donor cap would apply equally to all donors, no matter who they donate to or how they donate, whether directly or through an aggregator. This simple cap model would take more than half the private money out of the system and stand up to constitutional challenge. People should be able to support their candidate by donating their time or money. A spending cap would stop people from being able to participate by donating. It’s hard to structure a spending cap that is actually fair to new challengers, because of the significant incumbency and party advantages. I’m open to considering a cap proposal from the government that is fair, but I haven’t seen one yet.” Queensland deputy premier says byelection results show opposition leader could lead the state The Queensland deputy premier, Cameron Dick, has pilloried the Liberal National Party for refusing to reveal its position on the government’s plan to upgrade Suncorp Stadium for the Olympic Games ceremonies.Labor MPs ditched their ministerial statements in parliament on Tuesday morning with only the premier addressing the house to defend the government’s decision to reject a proposal to build a $3.4bn stadium at Victoria Park. The government will instead go with the cheaper option of upgrading Suncorp Stadium and the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre. Dick told reporters on Tuesday the government’s strategy was to force the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, to reveal his party’s position. This weekend, the by-elections demonstrated that David Crisafulli could truly become the premier of Queensland. The question for David Crisafulli, it really is simple. Does he support the plan for good value games or does he support a new $3.4bn stadium at Victoria Park? The Labor government came to parliament today to fight ... We came to ensure that David Crisafulli could no longer run away from the most important question of today.” His comments came after LNP deputy leader, Jarrod Bleijie, said on Monday that if elected the party would go back to the drawing board and ask a planned independent infrastructure authority to make a plan. Labor’s Farrell says some teal MPs hypocrites on political funding The special minister of state, Don Farrell, has accused some teal independents of hypocrisy for proposing a cap of $1.5m on political donations but no cap on spending on election campaigns. Farrell said: Labor is committed to this reform. We need to stop billionaires throwing their money around and trying to buy our elections. Some of the teals are saying to us that they agree with banning big money, just not theirs.” Earlier today, teal MPs including Kate Chaney, Allegra Spender, Zali Steggall and Zoe Daniel rejected any suggestion of hypocrisy, noting that many of their donations were from smaller donations. We’ll bring you a full news story shortly. ABC to meet Ukrainian ambassador to discuss Russia-Ukraine documentary A spokesperson from the ABC has responded to criticism from the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia (which Daniel Hurst reported on earlier), saying the ABC will be meeting with the ambassador to discuss his concerns. The ABC on Monday broadcast a documentary from film maker Sean Langan on its Four Corners program, which presented the Russian side of the experience at the frontlines in the months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The spokesperson says: Ukraine’s War: The Other Side is a challenging but legitimate documentary made by reputable journalist Sean Langan and first aired last month on the UK’s ITV, that offers a rare insight into the lives of Russian soldiers during the war. It adds to our understanding of this tragic conflict and shows the full, horrific impact of the war. The reporter challenges the Russian soldiers and civilians featured in the film about their beliefs and opinions. The documentary is being seen internationally and is considered an important contribution to the reporting of the war. We believe Australian audiences also have the right to watch it and make up their own minds. Four Corners has broadcast several programs exploring aspects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, such as: Despair & Defiance: The Battle for Ukraine Inside Russia: Traitors and Heroes The People’s Fight: The Battle for Kherson The ABC will be meeting with the Ukrainian Ambassador to discuss his concerns. Australia, UK to discuss defence, climate, clean energy, cyber, and economic security  The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, isn’t the only international visitor to Australia, this week. The Australian government has confirmed it will welcome the UK’s foreign secretary (and former prime minister) David Cameron and the UK’s defence secretary, Grant Shapps. The pair will be in Canberra on Thursday for one-on-one talks with their direct counterparts, Penny Wong and Richard Marles. The four will then fly to Adelaide for annual all-in talks on Friday known as Aukmin. That’s not Aukus; it’s stands for the Australia-United Kingdom Ministerial Consultations. They will discuss ways to deepen cooperation between Australia and the UK “across defence, climate action and clean energy, cyber, and economic security”, a statement issued by the Australian government says. Marles says it is “an increasingly complex strategic environment” and he looks forward to “working with our United Kingdom counterparts this week to progress ambitious new initiatives to deepen our defence partnership”. Wong says Australia and the UK are “working together, including in the Indo-Pacific, for a world that is peaceful, stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty”. Peter Dutton is now saying the government “went to the election with a promise that has now turned into a lie” which is an interesting line to take, given that the voice was also an election promise, but Dutton and the Coalition called on the government to scrap the referendum because there was no bipartisan support. One of the reasons the government is shelving religious freedoms is because it does not want to have a debate on religion in the current climate of heightened Islamophobia and antisemitism when there is no bipartisan support for the bill. The government has learnt, through what happened in the voice referendum, what can happen when there is no bipartisan support in areas of great community sensitivity. But Dutton is saying the government should press on, regardless, because it was an election commitment.",2024-03-19

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,704,Australia will bring home surveillance aircraft supporting Ukraine within weeks,"Australia is set to bring home a surveillance aircraft that has helped to protect the delivery of military and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, but denies it is part of any broader scaling back of support for the country. The Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail – which has conducted regular flying missions to monitor threats since its deployment to Germany in October – is likely to end its current role within weeks. The Wedgetail, based on the Boeing 737-700, features a long-range surveillance radar and is equipped to simultaneously track airborne and maritime targets, according to the RAAF. The original deployment was in response to a US request. It is understood the US has not requested an extension of the deployment beyond its April deadline, and there will not be a gap in western monitoring as a result of Australia ending the mission. A Defence spokesperson said the Wedgetail had helped protect the international flow of assistance into Ukraine “by providing early warning in the unlikely event of an act or threat from Russia, outside of Ukraine, against the gateway of humanitarian and military assistance”. Asked whether Australia would extend the deployment, the spokesperson said “any future requests for support” from Australia’s international partners would be “considered in the usual way”. Ukraine has sunk a number of ships in Russia’s powerful Black Sea fleet over the past two years, but the Australian Wedgetail was not providing information to enable such attacks, the spokesperson said. “The E-7A Wedgetail operates outside of Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian airspace. It is not providing surveillance assistance to Ukraine.” The Defence spokesperson emphasised that Australian troops continued to help train Ukrainian armed forces personnel in the UK. The situation in Ukraine, more than two years after Russia’s invasion, is likely to be on the agenda when British ministers visit Australia for talks this week. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, and the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, will hold the annual meeting with their counterparts, Penny Wong and Richard Marles, in Adelaide on Friday. Marles said it was “an increasingly complex strategic environment” and he looked forward to “working with our United Kingdom counterparts this week to progress ambitious new initiatives to deepen our defence partnership”. Wong said Australia and the UK were seeking “a world that is peaceful, stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty”. The Australian government’s position is to help Ukraine end the war “on its terms”. Last month it announced a further $50m grant to the UK-administered International Fund for Ukraine. This brought Australia’s total overall support to Ukraine to $960m, including $780m in military aid. However, the Ukrainian government is increasingly anxious about “fatigue” in western support, particularly amid a holdup in the US congress of a $60bn package for Ukraine.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,705,West condemns ‘undemocratic’ Russian election as results show Putin landslide,"Western nations have widely condemned Russia’s presidential election, in which Vladimir Putin claimed a landslide victory that will keep him in power until at least 2030 amid a crackdown on dissent and opposition. “These Russian elections starkly underline the depth of repression under President Putin’s regime, which seeks to silence any opposition to his illegal war,” said the British foreign secretary, David Cameron, as EU foreign ministers met to approve new sanctions against 30 individuals and organisations in response to the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. “Putin removes his political opponents, controls the media, and then crowns himself the winner. This is not democracy,” Cameron said. In Washington, the state department spokesperson Vedant Patel denounced the election as “undemocratic” and said the US would not congratulate Putin. “This was an incredibly undemocratic process,” Patel told reporters, detailing the jailing and disqualification of opponents and Navalny’s death in an Arctic penal colony. “He is likely to remain the president of Russia, but that does not excuse him of his autocracy,” Patel said. Calling Russia a dictatorship, a German government spokesperson said the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would not congratulate Putin on his re-election in a vote viewed by Berlin as “predetermined”. The official tally from the three-day election was a 87.28% share of the vote for Putin, which the Kremlin on Monday portrayed as a dominant victory, saying the results showed that the people had consolidated around the Russian president. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters: “This is the most eloquent confirmation of the level of support from the population of the country for its president, and its consolidation around him.” In a victory speech on Sunday, Putin dismissed western criticism of the election as unfair and undemocratic, telling his supporters it was “expected”. He also for the first time addressed Navalny’s death, which he called a “sad event”. At a concert on Moscow’s Red Square on Monday evening to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the annexation of Crimea, Putin basked in his election win, singing the national anthem with a crowd waving Russian flags. “Hand in hand, we will move forward and this will make us stronger ... Long live Russia,” Putin said. Putin’s swift seizure of Crimea in March 2014 is seen as the beginning of 10 years of military action against Ukraine and a cornerstone of Putin’s reimagined Russia. Putin told the crowd that Crimea was the “pride of Russia” and that the Black Sea peninsula had “come back to its native harbour” when Moscow annexed the region. He attended the concert alongside the three loyalist presidential candidates who ran against him. The Russian president usually speaks at the annual celebration that marks the Crimea annexation, a speech that was preceded on Monday by patriotic songs performed by pro-Putin singers. Several independent Russian outlets reported that state employees and students had been ordered to attend the celebrations. Russia has a long history of state employees being coerced to attend pro-government rallies. Together with the crowd, Putin sang the Russian national anthem before leaving the stage. Putin’s vote share, which equates to 76 million votes and is by far the biggest in post-Soviet Russian history, follows an election described as a mockery by an independent monitor group. The independent Russian election watchdog Golos said it had found unprecedented levels of fraud in the presidential elections. “Never before have we seen a presidential [election] campaign that fell so far short of constitutional standards,” said Golos, whose co-director is now in jail in Russia. “The elections failed to fulfil their main function: to reflect ​​the real mood of citizens, and they did not allow [citizens] to independently and freely make decisions about the future of their country,” it added. While shunned by the west, there were congratulations for Putin from the leaders of China and North Korea, two countries that have propped up Moscow in its fighting in Ukraine. Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed Putin’s “decisive victory”, the state news agency IRNA reported. Russia has deployed Iran-made drones against Ukrainian cities. Putin also received messages from India and the United Arab Emirates, two traditional western allies that Moscow has successfully courted since the start of the war in Ukraine more than two years ago. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered his “warm congratulations” to Putin, adding that he looked forward to developing their “special” relationship.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,706,Sunak and Badenoch put on united front in face of high-level fawning | Zoe Williams,"Before we go to the Business Connect conference in Warwickshire, a quick “previously in Tory endgame”: Rishi Sunak was under pressure, as even Conservative MPs who thought that however bad he was, changing leaders would be worse, were starting to revise their view. Penny Mordaunt’s name had been floated, but she was commonly thought of as the stalking horse candidate, for the more plausible Kemi Badenoch (at this point, you just have to imagine inverted commas round all the adjectives, a kind of “who-are-these-people?” confetti). Rishi had threatened a general election if people didn’t stop challenging his leadership. Kemi had told everyone not to be silly. And then the pair arrived before the burghers of Coventry and Warwickshire, to tell them how great the Conservatives were going to be for small businesses. Sunak had three main announcements: cutting taxes, cutting red tape and creating 20,000 apprenticeships. It was pretty dry fare. He didn’t even get a laugh when, talking about his determination to get rid of national insurance contributions, he said: “We’ll make more progress towards abolition in the next parliament.” Seriously? You seriously think you’ll be in parliament, rather than, say, California? He talked about the 2,000 EU regulations that have already been scrapped, the 500 more to go. He talked about the VAT threshold going up to £90,000. He talked about the absolute scandal that only 2% of equity investment goes to female founders. “I have two young girls,” he said, “and as a dad first and foremost, I want to make sure my girls grow up in a society where there isn’t a limit to their aspirations. Making sure that they have access to the finance they need is really important.” Right, so we definitely need a taskforce. No way could they ask their parents or, for that matter, their legit billionaire grandparents. Badenoch, afterwards, made the peculiar decision to repeat everything he’d just said, adding some truly minor tweaks to the machine, a new government advice body, to make sure everyone can use cutting-edge digital technology. She’s much more interesting when she goes off script, the business secretary. Describing in general terms (as Sunak did) the crises of this decade, she said: “What is actually phenomenal is that our businesses are still here.” Now she mentions it, it is quite surprising, but not because of Covid or Ukraine. How is anyone planning for the future in this permanent chaos? Then, off the cuff: “We all think of apprentices as being 19-year-olds who’ve never done a day’s work in their lives,” she said. Do we, though? Because that sounds like we think they’re lazy gits, whereas I think of them more as people who haven’t worked because they were busy at school and, before that, being babies. When I say “interesting”, of course I mean “scary”. Nobody wants to bandy around words like “North” and “Korea”, but my God, the fawning. First, to Sunak: “Your announcement is fantastic,” said Julie White of the construction industry. A bit more of a comment than a question, but hear her out. “But we seem to have devalued apprenticeships in the UK, because the only way into a fantastic job is through university.” “Perfect,” Sunak replied, presumably by accident. Indeed it was. A stage-managed praise-filled non-question, perfectly delivered. Then came George Paul, cheesemonger, who turns more than £10m a year in exports. “What advice would you give, for budding entrepreneurs, in our trade and all the rest of the British industries, to take that leap, to look for success?” Agog, we were. I like success as much as the next man. Can the prime minister help me look for it? “Start from a position of confidence in what you do,” he said. “The world wants to buy British. We stand for quality, we stand for best in class, we stand for innovation.” You’re already British, folks; now all you have to do is believe. Maybe close your eyes. If you have some red heels you could click, that might help. As hard as it to believe, Badenoch’s set piece was more sycophantic. She invited two entrepreneurs on to the stage, Thomas Hal Robson-Kanu who’s brought the turmeric shot to market, and Libby Hart, who makes women’s workwear, and asked them for their priority ask of government. Hart said two things: help British manufacturers find the skills (with apprentices) and invest in women. In other words, it would be beyond awesome if someone announced those two things you’ve just announced. Robson-Kanu went one better: “Really making the opportunities available, visible. By hosting days like today.” My businessman’s dream is if someone would put on an event like this one we’re currently sitting in. Journalists afterwards gave both a much tougher time, quizzing Sunak on his ungovernable party and Badenoch on Frank Hester, the racist stain that won’t go away. Their answers were variations on a theme; this is just Westminster nonsense, they’re interested in the real things that real people care about. Real things like whether the daughters of prime ministers will have access to venture capital, or be cruelly locked out by the scourge of sexism; like whether British businesses believe in their Britishness hard enough; like temporary tariff suspensions on 120 imports. Sunak and Badenoch put on a front in which not only were they united, but they’d found the last 15 people in the country who couldn’t agree more.",2024-03-18 16:13:37,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/18/rishi-sunak-kemi-badenoch-business-conservatives,The Guardian,706,go business connect conference quick previously tory rishi pressure even conservative thought however bad would worse starting revise view penny name commonly thought stalking horse candidate plausible point imagine inverted round kind rishi general election people didnt stop leadership told everyone silly pair tell great going small three main cutting cutting red tape 20000 pretty dry fare didnt even get laugh talking determination get rid national insurance said well make progress towards abolition next parliament seriously seriously think parliament rather say 2000 eu already scrapped 500 go vat threshold going £ 90000 absolute scandal 2 equity investment go female two young said dad first foremost want make sure grow society limit making sure access finance need really important right definitely need way could ask matter legit billionaire afterwards made peculiar decision repeat everything said truly minor machine new government advice body make sure everyone use digital technology much interesting go script business secretary general crisis decade said actually phenomenal still quite surprising covid anyone future permanent chaos cuff think 19yearolds never done day work said though like think theyre lazy whereas think people havent worked busy school say interesting course mean scary nobody bandy around like north korea god fawning first announcement fantastic said white construction industry bit comment question hear seem way fantastic job university perfect presumably accident indeed perfectly came cheesemonger turn £ 10m year advice would give budding trade rest take leap look success agog like success much next man prime minister help look start position confidence said world buy stand quality stand best class stand innovation already believe maybe close red could click might help hard believe set piece sycophantic two stage brought turmeric shot market hart priority ask government hart said two help find invest would beyond awesome someone two youve went one better really making available visible hosting day like today dream someone would put event like one currently sitting afterwards gave much time ungovernable party frank racist stain wont go away theme nonsense theyre interested real real people care real like whether prime access venture capital cruelly locked scourge like whether believe hard enough like temporary tariff 120 put front united found last 15 people country agree put united front face fawning
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,707,Are progressive politics the real reason why US lawmakers are spooked by Tiktok? | Arwa Mahdawi,"Tick tock, tick tock … that’s the sound of time running out for Gen Z’s favourite app. On Wednesday the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill would require the TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media platform or get banned in the US. It’s not clear whether the bill would pass in the Senate. However, the White House has said it supports the legislation. All in all, things don’t look great for TikTok. Lawmakers would have you believe that the reason they’re on the warpath when it comes to TikTok is because Beijing-based ByteDance is a national security threat. They’re worried that China is going to do nefarious things with personal user data and that the TikTok algorithm has the ability to unduly influence Americans. It should be noted that while these fears aren’t unfounded, lawmakers’ obsession with the platform being controlled by China seems to ignore the fact that – as the Financial Times notes – “some 60% of [ByteDance] is actually owned by ‘international’ investors, overwhelmingly American”. While the US government may be citing national security as their motivation for clamping down on TikTok, influential model and activist Emily Ratajkowski has other ideas. On Thursday Ratajkowski told her 2.7 milliom TikTok followers that she reckons the government wants to ban the platform because it has become a hub for progressive activism. “Because this is one of the few platforms that isn’t completely controlled by the US government, or through corporations that have the US government’s interest in mind, progressive politics have been able to blossom on here,” Ratajkowski said. “TikTok is being banned,” she added, “because the US government is legitimately scared with the influence that it’s having … which to me indicates that TikTok is a very powerful tool for organization, for alternative thinking and for activism.” There’s certainly an argument to be made that the US government isn’t pleased with some of the progressive politics popping up on TikTok. Last year, for example, a number of members of Congress, along with some conservative activists and tech investors, expressed their outrage about the amount of pro-Palestinian content on the platform and argued that TikTok’s algorithm was biased towards Palestine. Funnily enough these same people don’t seem to have much to say about reports which show the US mainstream media is biased towards pro-Israel coverage. Nor do these critics seem particularly concerned about reports from the likes of Human Rights Watch which say Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, systemically censors voices in support of Palestine. TikTok, for its part, has said its algorithm isn’t pro-Palestine. Rather, the company noted in a statement, content on the platform simply reflects the fact that it has a young user base and “attitudes among young people skewed toward Palestine long before TikTok existed”. That said, it’s not even clear that there’s more pro-Palestinian content on TikTok than pro-Israel content – a lot depends on how you interpret that data. Nevertheless, it is certainly perceived to be friendlier towards pro-Palestinian content than other social media platforms. To be clear: I’m not trying to argue that US lawmakers want to ban TikTok just because of pro-Palestinian voices on the platform. Nor am I saying that TikTok is some beacon of progressive values. Far from it. It has a history of censoring LGBT content in certain areas. And, like almost every other social media app out there, it sucks up swathes of your personal data and does god knows what with it. I think it is right to be wary of TikTok’s power and influence and I think everyone should be alarmed at how much power a single app has. But it’s hardly like TikTok is the only worrying social media platform out there is it? If the US government wants to regulate how much influence tech companies have, and the extent to which they can mine our personal data, then they need to do it across the board, rather than singling out one particular platform. Again, I don’t think TikTok is, in itself, a beacon of progressive values. However, Ratajkowski is right in saying it has been a useful platform for a lot of progressive activists. Not just when it comes to Palestine, but also when it comes to issues like abortion, trans rights and anti-racism efforts. In increasingly authoritarian times we need to protect free speech with everything we’ve got. Banning TikTok is a blatant attack on our first amendment rights and the bipartisan support this ban is receiving should worry us all. Cheering on government-led censorship is a dangerous road that doesn’t lead anywhere good. Earlier this week Stone told the Louis Theroux podcast that she’d been pressured into sleeping with Baldwin in the 1993 film Silver. Per Stone, the late Robert Evans, who headed production at Paramount, said she should have sex with her co-star to improve his performance. “Not sure why Sharon Stone keep talking about me all these years later?” Baldwin tweeted on Tuesday. “Does she still have a crush on me or is she still hurt after all these years because I shunned her advances?” He added: “Wonder if I should write a book and tell the many, many disturbing, kinky and unprofessional tales about Sharon? That might be fun.” Baldwin (not to be confused with his more successful brother Alec) has had an extremely forgettable career and I’ve got a feeling these sexist tweets are going to end up being what he’s most famous for. “Because Butler is a human rights activist, as well as a theorist, the urgent point conveyed by this book is the same as it is in all their work,” writes Finn MacKay in a Guardian review of Butler’s new book, which advocates for gender diversity. “Why are so many people seemingly happy to give away their power to increasingly authoritarian forces? And why are they so confident that this power will never be used against them?” This law isn’t new but has recently gained nationwide attention.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,708,‘Everything is possible’: a worrying new book explores the danger of disinformation,"You might not have heard of Rosanne Boyland. She made the 10-hour drive from Kennesaw, Georgia, to Washington on 5 January 2021. The next day, the 34-year-old died after losing consciousness in the crush of a mob of Donald Trump supporters as it surged against US Capitol police. She would never have been there, her sister said later, “if it weren’t for all the misinformation”. The tragedy opens Barbara McQuade’s new book, Attack from Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America. The NBC News and MSNBC legal analyst explores how the deliberate spreading of lies disguised as truth has been weaponised to consolidate power in the hands of the few, undermine legal structures and drive voters such as Boyland. It is both cause and symptom of the US’s corrosive polarisation. A former national security prosecutor, McQuade has seen the threat of disinformation evolve from al-Qaida to Islamic State to cyber-attacks from Russia. Teaching at the University of Michigan Law School, where she is a professor, she had her students study special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on 2016 election interference by Russia. “I was fascinated by the details of accounts that were created by Russian operatives with names like Blacktivist or Heart of Texas posing as grassroots activists on the right or the left or various groups, and then taking very divisive stands on various issues just in an effort to sow discord,” McQuade, 59, says in an interview in the lobby of a Washington hotel. It was then Trump’s bogus “stop the steal” movement in 2020, based on the big lie of widespread voter fraud rejected in more than 60 lawsuits and by his own attorney general, that inspired her to write the book. It considers lessons learned ahead of a potential repeat in 2024 as the US braces for a Joe Biden v Trump rematch. “We will definitely get interference from foreign adversaries, including Russia and probably China, North Korea, maybe Iran, but there is a domestic part of this now where we are already hearing Donald Trump talk about how voting by mail is unreliable and laying the groundwork so that, if and when he loses, and there are more Democrats who have voted by mail than Republicans, he will have credibility. “He will say: ‘See, I won the election and then it all flipped for me. It was fraud.’ The same strategy that he used in in 2020. I don’t know if he’ll have new strategies but ‘stop the steal’ was a classic disinformation influence campaign based on no evidence whatsoever.” Trump commentary falls into categories. Some stop short of drawing comparisons with Adolf Hitler, perhaps wary of Godwin’s law, which holds that as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches. Others dive in, arguing that some aspects of Trump’s authoritarianism, nativism and charisma do evoke the Nazi tyrant in enlightening ways. McQuade goes there with an “authoritarian playbook” charting a brief history of disinformation from Hitler and Benito Mussolini to Jair Bolsonaro and Trump and noting the tactics: demonising the other, seducing with nostalgia, silencing critics, muzzling the media, condemning the courts and stoking violence. She elaborates: “Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf that there are two things that are essential to effective propaganda. One was a very simple repeatable message because when people hear a message repeated again and again – and start hearing it from different sources – they begin to believe it to be true. “The other is that the bigger the lie, the more likely it is to be believed. All of us are guilty of white lies from time to time that we might say out of kindness. My sister might say your hair looks fine when she means anything but, or my husband might say to me, no, dear, that dress doesn’t make you look fat. “They’re saying these things out of kindness, even though they might be technically lying. As Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf, most people would not ever imagine that anyone could have the audacity to lie about something that is so significant – he was talking about the role of Jewish people in society, for example. “But here the big lie for Trump was that the election has been stolen because people say: ‘How could you possibly pull that off? It’s so ridiculous.’ That’s part of what gives it its credibility and he knows that so I worry we’re going to begin to hear that again, and there are a significant number of Americans who still believe that the 2020 election was stolen. There will always be people who are manipulated by those strategies.” Now the history of the January 6 insurrection itself is being rewritten, with the rioters recast as “patriots” and, if tried and imprisoned, as “hostages” whom Trump is promising to pardon if elected. Opinion polls show that more than a third of Americans believe that Biden’s election was illegitimate; Republicans are more sympathetic to the US Capitol rioters now than they were in 2021. McQuade says with some dismay: “They assaulted people, they brought weapons, they broke windows, they spread faeces on the walls of the temple of democracy, they carried Confederate flags in there. Now to refer to it as legitimate political discourse or ordinary tourist activity, and then to refer to people who have been arrested, charged and imprisoned for their crimes as hostages, is absolutely a brand of disinformation. I’m curious to see how many people will continue to fall for that in this election.” Trump svengali Steve Bannon, an arch election denier and vaccine conspiracy theorist, once memorably declared that the real opposition was the media and the way to deal with them was to “flood the zone with shit”. This brings to mind the Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. McQuade cites the Russian author and journalist Peter Pomerantsev on “the fog of unknowability”. She explains: “Everything is possible and nothing matters, and so everything’s PR because people begin to doubt the very existence of truth. One day Putin might say the missiles were shot by Ukraine; the next day the missiles were shot by Russia; the next day the missiles were shot by Nato. “People don’t know what to think and consistency doesn’t matter. In fact, inconsistency is part of the point, because first people become angry and then they become cynical and then finally they become numb and disengaged from politics altogether and so that’s a very dangerous place for democracy. “The other thing that people think in Russia is that truth is for suckers: you should just get what you can while you can and everybody is corrupt, which is one of the things that causes Donald Trump to constantly be suggesting that the Bidens are corrupt – if everybody is corrupt, then it gives you permission to overlook Donald Trump’s corruption, right? “‘Well, they’re all corrupt. Who knows what to believe? All these investigations are themselves weaponised and corrupt so I might as well look for someone who is strong, who will advance my values despite all of his corruption.’ This normalisation of corruption is something that is part of it all as well.” How has it come to this? McQuade, who was born in Detroit and lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan, identifies three central causes. First, the delivery mechanism of disinformation has changed. For centuries, the deceiver had to rely on word of mouth or leaflets or planting a false story, perhaps in a foreign newspaper, in the hope that someone would pick it up and pass it on. Now someone can spread a lie at the push of a button. “Social media is a wonderful tool and can connect us to people all over the world in wonderful ways, but can also be used as a weapon when people want to and so it has been a really efficient vehicle for delivering disinformation,” says the author. “They’re completely unaccountable and we have ceded all of our power on social media to a handful of young bro billionaires, whose interest, of course, is in their own profits, not in the social good.” Second, we are living through the worst political divisions in America since the 1861-1865 civil war. McQuade reckons it began with the combative, attention-grabbing Republican Newt Gingrich in the 1990s, and has grown as parties concentrate on turning out their bases rather than finding common ground. With elections framed as an existential struggle between good and evil, voters demand political purity. “If my tribe says X then I say X too, even if I don’t believe X to be true.” Third, there is anxiety about a changing world: the climate crisis, refugees and border security, economic shifts with potential job losses. It is fertile soil for demagogues who promise that they alone can fix it. “We have leaders who want to use that to stoke fear because they perceive that that will be in their own political interest to attract those voters who are concerned about those changes and attract them into their own fold. “It’s a combination of those three things that Donald Trump has exploited in this country like no one we’ve ever seen. I don’t think that he’s necessarily a political genius, but I do think he’s a conman and a marketing genius who knows how to sell things. He’s a huckster and he has taken advantage of this moment for personal and political gain.” The huckster’s rise nearly a decade ago caught the media off guard. The old and laudable rules of balance, impartiality and not editorialising no longer seemed to work when one candidate was so blatantly mendacious. The New York Times newspaper broke the seal in 2016 with the headline: Trump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent. But as another election looms, McQuade worries that journalists have still not figured out how to cover him. “That which is novel is always newsworthy, that which is controversial is always newsworthy, and so they present those things. But in an effort to present both sides of a story and in a tradition of not calling people liars, they have allowed Donald Trump and his supporters to manipulate them and play them. They’ll just say he made a statement that is not backed up by evidence; say he’s lying! You gotta say it out loud.” But Attack from Within is not a letter of surrender or obituary of America. McQuade offers solutions for countering disinformation and maintaining the rule of law, such as making domestic terrorism a federal crime, reviving local journalism, criminalising doxxing (the act of revealing identifying information about someone online) and considering a ban on online anonymous accounts. The former US attorney for the eastern district of Michigan urges politicians to get ahead of the curve of artificial intelligence. “I hope that our Congress can do something which we failed to do with social media, which is get ahead of it, because if it can put things in place before they create havoc, it’s much easier than trying to react after the fact.” Individual citizens, she says, can gain skills be critical consumers of social media. “We can educate ourselves and take responsibility by doing things like, when we read an article, don’t rely just on the headline; we should actually read the article before we forward it to someone else. “We should look for second sources of a story; if there’s an outrageous story, someone else will be reporting it. If there is data in a story, we should look at that data. How big was the sample set? Was it a sample of three or a sample of 3m? That makes a difference. Were the results of this study a causation or just coincidence with an outcome? We need to do that.” McQuade also calls for increasing media literacy in schools and a revival of teaching civics rather than focusing on test scores. “Civics education is important for all of us, because when someone explains to you how the separation of powers works and how the three branches of government work, it is impossible to believe that a president could be immune from prosecution. We all need that education.” Attack from Within is out now",2024-03-16 07:18:01,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/16/attack-from-within-book-dangers-of-disinformation,The Guardian,708,might

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,709,The Guardian view on child mortality: it’s bad – but it’s getting better | Editorial,"In 2022, almost 5 million children under five died around the world – equivalent to one death every six seconds. Each one of those deaths is a story of grief and of unfulfilled potential; of the farmers, scientists, labourers, poets and traders who will not be. The large majority of these deaths, tallied in a UN report published this week, were entirely preventable. Those growing up in the highest-mortality country face a risk of dying before age five that is 80 times greater than in the lowest-mortality country. Yet as grim as the figure is, it is also cause for optimism. This was a historic low. More children are surviving today than ever before. The global mortality rate for this age group has declined by 51% since 2000. There is no one simple explanation for this fall: it came from sustained hard work across a range of measures, from support in childbirth to vaccination drives to nutrition programmes. That same determination will be required if the sustainable development goal of ending preventable deaths of children aged under five by 2030 is to be met. That would save 9 million lives. But progress in reducing neonatal and young child mortality has slowed, compared to the leaps of the millennium development goal era. That largely reflects the fact that many of the easy wins available have already been made, such as increasing vaccine coverage and basic treatment. If current trends continue, 59 countries will miss the SDG target. And that is not the worst case scenario. The impact of the climate crisis, the economic effects of the pandemic and its disruption of vaccinations, and wars in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, Myanmar and elsewhere, are painful reminders that the risk is not only of health gains stagnating; they could well go into reverse. Children in conflict-hit countries are, unsurprisingly, much more likely to die. The global food crisis means that the number of people going hungry rose by 122 million, to 735 million, between 2019 and 2022. The report notes that “uninterrupted mortality decline is precarious, requiring unyielding commitment and investment.” It also warns of “the possibility that crisis, fragility and conflict become more frequent in the years to come”. The five countries with the highest child mortality rates are all in sub-Saharan Africa, with south Asia also showing high rates. Yet progress has not only come in relatively wealthier places. Three low-income countries – Malawi, Rwanda and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea – and four lower-middle-income countries – Cambodia, Mongolia, Sâo Tomé and Principe, and Uzbekistan – have reduced under-five mortality by more than 75% since 2000. Hans Rosling, the late Swedish physician whose book Factfulness argued that most of us fail to recognise global progress, once wrote: “Does saying ‘things are improving’ imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it’s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.” To say that millions of children are dying preventable deaths is to face a horrifying truth. But it need not mean succumbing to despair: though they have not been prevented, such future losses can be. Commitment to, and investment in, the health of children yields dramatic results. We must recognise and celebrate the resulting gains. We should also use them as a spur to redouble efforts.",2024-03-15 18:30:42,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-child-mortality-its-bad-but-its-getting-better,The Guardian,709,2022 almost 5 million five around world equivalent one death every six one story grief unfulfilled potential large majority un report week entirely preventable growing country face risk dying age five 80 time greater country yet grim figure also cause optimism historic low surviving today ever global mortality rate age group declined 51 since 2000 one simple explanation fall came sustained hard work across range support childbirth vaccination nutrition determination sustainable development goal ending preventable aged five 2030 met would save 9 million progress reducing neonatal young child mortality millennium development goal era largely fact many easy available already made increasing vaccine coverage basic treatment current continue 59 miss target worst case scenario impact climate crisis economic effect pandemic disruption elsewhere painful risk health gain could well go reverse much likely die global food crisis number people going hungry rose 122 million 735 million 2019 2022 report uninterrupted mortality decline precarious unyielding commitment investment also possibility crisis fragility conflict become frequent come five highest child mortality south also showing high yet progress come relatively three democratic republic korea four reduced mortality 75 since 2000 late physician whose book u fail global progress wrote saying improving imply everything fine worry bad better must think current state world say million dying preventable face truth need mean despair though future commitment investment health dramatic must celebrate resulting gain also use spur redouble guardian view child mortality bad getting better editorial
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,710,‘It’s so weird’: the TV show about a woman who turns into a chicken nugget,"Last December, Netflix released an exhaustive report entitled What We Watched, detailing the time its subscribers spent watching every film and television programme on its platform. One of the biggest surprises was the sheer number of foreign-language productions we consume. In total, these productions accounted for a full third of all streamed Netflix content. And leading the way was South Korea. The report revealed that, following the planet-conquering phenomenon that was Squid Game, the K-drama series The Glory was the third most-watched Netflix show globally. This, you have to admit, is incredible. There is a huge global hunger for Korean output. If it comes from South Korea, people will watch it in their droves. Possibly. Because the newest South Korean series to hit Netflix is Chicken Nugget. It’s a television series about a woman who turns into a chicken nugget and, as such, might be one of the oddest things currently available to watch. Based on a webcomic by Park Jidok, whose previous work includes comics called Potato Village and Killer Farts, Chicken Nugget is almost aggressively esoteric. The story is about a hapless intern at a machine company who harbours a crush on his boss’s daughter. But then a mysterious machine appears in the office, and she gets into it and accidentally says the words “chicken nugget” out loud, and it turns her into one. Imagine a version of The Fly where Jeff Goldblum gets fully turned into a fly after just 15 minutes and you’re on the right track. Also, in this version of The Fly, Goldblum gets turned into a small piece of chicken, one of the only things on Earth that is less dramatically interesting than a fly. That’s roughly where we are. Unlike something like Squid Game, which came swaggering in laden with extremely expensive Hollywood-level production design, Chicken Nugget was very clearly made on the cheap. It’s bright like a daytime soap opera, it has very few traditional action sequences and a big percentage of its visual-effects budget seems to have been spent on making a chicken nugget wobble very slightly. It’s so weird and bargain basement-y that there is a good chance you will get a few minutes into the first episode and decide that Chicken Nugget is simply not for you. But this would be a mistake. I was fully ready to bail on the show, until a brief sequence where the father of the woman who turned into a chicken nugget grieves her predicament. He remembers bringing her up alone after the death of her mother. He’s scared and overwhelmed, but he’s proud of the woman she’s becoming. And I’ll be damned if it isn’t one of the most unexpectedly moving things I’ve seen in an age. Somehow this stupid show, one that often feels as if it was free-associated rather than traditionally written, wrestled a true emotional response from me. From there, inexplicably, Chicken Nugget keeps getting better and better. It becomes less about the weirdness of a woman who is trapped in chicken form, and more about the bonding that happens between the two people who try to get her back. Soon, the girl’s father and the intern team up to try to discover what exactly happened to her, uncovering a long and complicated conspiracy that branches off down a number of incredibly strange tributaries that, among other things, provide a whistlestop journey through Korean culinary history. Sign up to What's On Get the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Monday after newsletter promotion Given its meagre budget, the show takes some bold formal leaps, too. We travel hundreds of years into the past, and several decades into the future, in our attempt to figure out exactly what happened to this poor nugget lady. Extraordinary new characters are introduced. There’s an ambition here that cannot be tamed. Had Chicken Nugget been given the blockbuster treatment, there’s a chance that all this would have come off as overwrought, as something being prestige just for the sake of it. But the show’s shonky, cheapo production prevents that. It has to rely on charm alone to get by, and this is something it has in spades. Realistically, Chicken Nugget won’t get close to equalling The Glory’s popularity. If it even makes the top half of the next What We Watched report I’ll be staggered. It’s far too bizarre and homemade for that.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,711,The one thing we’ve learned from the Kate photo scandal? There’s no such thing as a fairytale life | Zoe Williams,"Kensington Palace, which remains in its private quarters the London residence of Prince William and Kate (for ever to be known as) Middleton, currently has an exhibition in its public rooms of “Untold Lives”, a medley of royal servants. If any of the tourists walking round on Thursday felt the piquancy of treading so close to a home Kate Middleton may or may not be in (for the first time since her marriage, probably, nobody can say for sure where she is), that didn’t show on their politely interested faces. The opening portrait is of Bridget Holmes: 96 years old, carrying a mop in comedic representation of her role as a “necessary woman” to monarchs all the way from Charles I to William III. Taking into account the different conception of childhood in the 1590s, when she was born, we can reasonably assume Holmes spent about 90 continuous years shovelling shit, her life remaining untold so that the story of kings could be told. That’s the deal with the monarchy; inequality needs two halves – a large number of lives debased and made menial to enable some shiny ones at the top. It would have made perfect sense when kings, having divine right, were a bridge between men and God, and a reasonable amount of sense in an age of greater deference, but these days it only makes sense if the spectacle of enormous wealth is itself somehow nourishing to the national psyche. If William and Kate represent some fantasy life, that we can enjoy remotely as a fairytale, projecting ourselves into it, then – here’s a cute paradox – the more that costs, the more it’s worth it. It never did it for me, but what do I know? The Prince and Princess of Wales only have one job in this contract, which is to enjoy perfect lives. People always go on about how hard the royals work, and I’ve never really bought it – how hard can it be, going places, shaking hands, being polite, going home? But if the real job is to embody a life in which wealth, being magic, has erased every care, then I can see that would be awesomely hard work. Just how much damage this family has inflicted on itself since Kate was last seen in public on Christmas Day will be impossible to determine until the mystery has lifted. Certainly, they’ve breached their contract with the world’s media. When news agencies had to pull the Mother’s Day photo of the princess and her three children, believing it to have been doctored, this holed them beneath the waterline, trust wise, and it’s hard to see how they could now recover. Phil Chetwynd, global news director of Agence France-Presse, described neutrally on BBC Radio 4 that the Firm had moved into the same credibility bucket as North Korea, which seems harsh – almost nobody, except everyone on the internet, thinks Kate Middleton has been shot in the head – but fair. Trust is pretty binary: you either have it or you don’t. The relationship between the British press and the royals has been vexed for ages, observably since Meghxit but arguably since Diana. The deal was supposed to be this: the tabloid press would write fawningly about the core team, choose one or two hate figures whose privacy would be traduced and inner life relentlessly speculated upon, and the Firm would enable all that with tactical intel drops and the turning of a blind eye. It really did seem in 1997 as though that equilibrium had been destroyed. In the aftermath of Diana’s death, the red tops talked about a “vast outpouring of grief”, and that was real, but they omitted to mention the rage people felt towards the newspapers that had hounded her. The palace, though, sought no vengeance. Only Harry admitted even holding a grudge, and things were back to normal pretty soon. Harry and Meghan’s various cases against the press were a mixed bag – some won, some dropped. What they didn’t achieve was any significant realignment of the media/monarchy protocols. In the end, it’s Harry living in the US, trying to make sense of a life he wasn’t born to rule, not the Daily Mail. With the British public, though, the royals’ contract is completely different. A small but growing number of us wish they would simply desist, become normal, stop costing so much. A sizeable middle doesn’t care one way or the other, and those who do watch these lives with fascinated admiration need them to be perfect. We can talk loftily about William and Kate’s missteps – how could they have been so stupid as to Photoshop an image, and so amateurishly? Don’t they know the first rule of lying, in public life, which is: stop doing it and tell the truth? But they haven’t been stupid at all, they’ve behaved exactly as humans do, trapped in a deal they can’t uphold. They cannot lead the perfect, trouble-free lives that they have to lead in order to make sense. The rumours and theories about what’s happened to Kate Middleton are so varied and lurid now that whatever the truth is, I anticipate its landing as a bit of an anticlimax, which will hasten the return of normality. So maybe they’ve actually played a blinder, and with their secrecy and cack-handedness generated a drama against which the truth will look like no big deal. But I don’t think this was deliberate. I think their lives are, ironically, a bit like a fairytale, but one of the dark ones, where a troll (or a nation of trolls) holds them hostage to an impossible demand.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,712,Chinese state media body condemns police harassment at site of deadly blast,"China’s journalist association has issued a rare rebuke over police harassment, after videos emerged of state media journalists being pushed away from the site of a deadly explosion. In a statement published on Wednesday evening, the All-China Journalists Association (AJCA), a Communist party-backed group, said that “legitimate interviews are a journalist’s right”, adding that the authorities “should not simply and brutally obstruct the media journalists from performing their duties in a normal manner in order to control public opinion”. The unusually forthright comments came after videos emerged of two state media journalists being blocked from reporting from the scene of a explosion in the northern province of Hebei. The blast, which killed seven people and injured 27, was triggered by a suspected gas leak in a restaurant. In one video, uniformed men interrupt the broadcast of Yang Hailing, a CCTV reporter, as she speaks to news anchors in the studio of the state broadcaster from the site of the explosion. One of the anchors looks visibly shocked as the report is obstructed. In another, a group of police officers surround Xu Mengzhe, a reporter who is clearly wearing a badge displaying the logo of China Media Group, the state-media parent company of CCTV and other broadcasters. In the video, Xu says: “We are three reporters surrounded by a dozen people, a dozen people pushed [us] apart, come and take a look”. “With such a major public safety incident, people are looking forward to learning more information. Journalists use a professional lens to record the actual disaster situation and the rescue process,” said the ACJA. The association said that the work of journalists was necessary to tackle online misinformation and “protect the people’s right to know”. The videos sparked a debate on Chinese social media, with some users saying that the reporters were moved for their own safety. China’s constitution guarantees press freedom. In reality, state media is tightly controlled and journalists for domestic and international outlets are routinely harassed, often physically, in the course of their reporting. Last year, three police officers were detained after a Chinese journalist was assaulted while trying to investigate the deaths of two teachers in Guizhou. Reporters Without Borders ranks China as the second-worst country in the world for press freedom, with only North Korea scoring worse. The ACJA’s statement contained “very unusual language” said David Bandurski, director of the China Media Project. “They’re basically upholding the right to report” and “upholding an idea that information is valuable to the public”, two concepts which “sound very much like a view of journalism that has been actively opposed” in China, particularly under the rule of China’s president, Xi Jinping. As of Thursday morning, the statement had been deleted from the association’s website but was still available on WeChat. Many comments on Chinese social media expressed support for the statement, saying that the rights of journalists to report on news events should be protected. Other commentaries asked why the ACJA had not defended other journalists, such as one who was beaten up in Guizhou. “Is this the first day you know this truth?” asked one liberal commentator on Weibo. “If you really care about journalists’ interview rights, you don’t have to wait until something happens to a CCTV reporter before you speak out.” Additional research by Chi Hui Lin",2024-03-14 05:57:35,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/14/china-explosion-restaurant-blast-state-media-police-harassment,The Guardian,712,journalist association rare rebuke police harassment state medium away site deadly explosion statement evening association communist group said legitimate right simply brutally obstruct medium normal manner order control public opinion unusually forthright came two state medium blocked scene explosion northern province blast seven people injured 27 triggered suspected gas leak restaurant one video uniformed men interrupt broadcast yang reporter news studio state broadcaster site explosion one visibly report another group police surround reporter clearly wearing badge china medium group parent company video three surrounded dozen people dozen people u apart come take look major public safety incident people looking forward learning information use professional lens record actual disaster situation rescue process said association said work necessary tackle misinformation protect right know sparked debate social medium saying safety constitution press freedom reality state medium tightly domestic international routinely often physically course last year three police journalist trying investigate two without china country world press freedom north korea scoring worse statement unusual language said director china medium project theyre basically right report idea information valuable public two sound much like view journalism actively opposed china particularly rule president xi morning statement still available many social medium expressed support statement saying report news one beaten first day know truth one liberal commentator really care interview dont wait something reporter speak additional research chi lin state medium body police harassment site deadly blast
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,713,Dutton’s blast of radioactive rhetoric on nuclear power leaves facts in the dust | Temperature Check,"We may not yet be entering a nuclear age in Australia, but we would all be best advised to handle the rhetoric around the issue as carefully as we would radioactive waste. This week opposition leader Peter Dutton said an annual CSIRO report that had included estimates of costs for small modular reactors – which are not yet available commercially – was “discredited” because it “doesn’t take into account some of the transmission costs, the costs around subsidies for the renewables”. Dutton is referring to a report known as GenCost, which calculates the cost of generating electricity from different technologies when fuel, labour and capital are included. This metric is known as the levelised cost of electricity. Despite Dutton’s claim, the most recent GenCost report does include the cost of integrating renewables such as solar and wind into the electricity grid. That is, it includes the cost of building new transmission lines and energy storage such as batteries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The most recent GenCost report estimates a theoretical small modular reactor built in 2030 would cost $382 to $636 per megawatt hour. It says this is much more expensive than solar and wind, which it puts at between $91 and $130 per MWh even once integration costs are included. The calculations in GenCost don’t include subsidies for any generating technologies – including renewables or future SMRs. The cost estimates for SMRs are challenging because no commercial plant has been built. But the closest a project has got to existing – the Carbon-Free Power Project in Utah – was cancelled late last year primarily because the cost of the power would have been too high. And that project was given more than $2bn from the US Department of Energy. Mycle Schneider is an independent nuclear expert and coordinator of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status report that tracks nuclear power development around the globe. He points to research from US financial group Lazard that says in the US, the costs of unsubsidised solar and wind including firming costs, such as batteries, range from US$45 to $141 per MWh compared to new-build nuclear at US$180 per MWh. “That is no doubt one reason why global investments in stationary batteries outpaced investments in nuclear in 2023,” he said. On Tuesday, Dutton said he would soon reveal six potential sites for nuclear reactors around Australia – likely to be close to, current or retiring coal-fired power stations. Shadow energy minister Ted O’Brien claimed this week Australia could have nuclear power “up and running” within a decade. “Nuclear ‘up and running within a decade’ does not fit with the experience we have seen elsewhere,” said Prof MV Ramana, a nuclear expert at the University of British Columbia and a contributor to the nuclear industry status reports. Ramana points to Finland that has operated reactors since the 1970s, where parliament voted in 2002 to add a fifth reactor to the country’s fleet. Work started in 2005 but the reactor didn’t connect until 2022 “almost exactly 20 years after the parliamentary vote,” he said. “We can see similar long periods of time between decisions to build reactors and when they start operating, again in countries that already have nuclear plants, in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.” Dutton and O’Brien have both said there are 30 economies around the world using nuclear and “50 more” that want to. But Schneider says there are actually 32 countries with nuclear reactors, “but the top five generators produced 72% of the nuclear electricity in the world.” “Over the past 30 years, only four countries started nuclear programs (Romania, Iran, Belarus, UAE) and three phased out their programs (Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Germany). There are reactors under construction in three more newcomer countries (Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkiye). Most other ‘plans’ are vague.” On Sky News, O’Brien pointed to the United Arab Emirates as a country that had commissioned South Korea’s Kepco to build four reactors of the size that could be considered for Australia in less than a decade. In fact, each of the 1.4GW UAE plants was expected to be delivered in five years, but took eight, according to the industry status report. And it took 12 years from the announcement of the plan in 2008, to the first unit coming online in 2020. The problem with using the UAE as a case study is that it is not a democracy, but an autocracy. “The UAE is not a good model for Australia,” Ramana said. The full cost of the project isn’t known, and the country did not have to worry about selecting sites (the plant is built in the desert on the coast), passing legislation through parliament – including to create regulatory bodies – or gaining environmental approvals. In 2017, the Korea Times reported 17,000 workers from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, India and other developing countries had been brought in to work at the reactor sites. Another 3,000 South Koreans were also working on the plants, the newspaper said. Experts have told the Guardian that even if Australia were to remove its federal and state bans on nuclear energy, it would be unlikely to see reactors generating power until the 2040s – at which point most, if not all, of Australia’s coal-fired power will have been turned off years earlier. One nuclear advocate questioned whether Australia could actually find a company to build reactors. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion This week one political journalist said on Sky that “Canada is about to put in small modular reactors” and had selected a site in Ontario. While Ontario Public Generation does plan to build a fleet of four small modular reactors, the company doesn’t yet have a licence to construct them. If it does go ahead, OPG has said it doesn’t expect the first-of-its-kind unit – each about one-tenth the size of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant – to be working commercially until the end of 2029. O’Brien and Dutton have rejected the notion that Australia would be “starting from scratch” on nuclear, citing the existence of the tiny reactor at Lucas Heights near Sydney, the country’s existing reserves of uranium and the agreement to buy nuclear-powered submarines in the future. Glenne Drover, the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Institute of Energy and a broad supporter of nuclear power, said it was “quite a step up” from the 20MW Lucas Heights research reactor “to 1,000MW+ and to build, own and operate a pressure reactor”. Drover said the expertise within the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation was a good start “but [Australia] would need a lot more, and would be trying to do this at the same time as UK, France, Canada and USA, and a few others.” As for uranium reserves, he said: “Yes we have uranium, but we do not have processing/concentrating. That is very specialist. It would be quite a leap to start doing that here.” Writing in The Australian last weekend, Danish political scientist Bjørn Lomborg said the news media made it feel as though “climate change is making the planet unliveable” but such an impression was “wildly misleading”. “Deaths have dropped precipitously,” he wrote. “Across the past decade, climate-related disasters have killed 98% fewer people than a century ago.” To achieve fewer disaster deaths, we should promote prosperity, adaptation, and resilience.But when we are inundated with ‘weather porn’ and miss the fact that deaths have dropped precipitously, we end up focusing on the least effective policies first.https://t.co/T9n50Qx1GS pic.twitter.com/roT1gNnzgt Lomborg, whose same article appeared a few weeks ago in the New York Post, has been making a similar claim for several years, pointing to data from EM-DAT – the International Disaster Database. Dr Damien Delforge, a researcher at the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters that administers the database, said he regarded Lomborg’s claims as a “skewed and crude trend analysis” that was “irrelevant to current climate change management and discussions”. The database has well-known biases. The data also doesn’t fully capture the health impact of climate change, Delforge said. The creation of the US government’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the 1960s and gradual improvements in communication technologies has seen many more disasters being reported in modern times. The centre actually warns that pre-2000 data should be excluded from any trend analysis. Delforge said Lomborg’s starting decade of the 1920s had just 39 disasters in the database with mortality figures. Of the deaths from that decade, he said, 99% came from only four disasters – two famines in China that killed 3.5 million people, a 1921 drought that killed 1.2m in Ukraine and a 1922 typhoon that killed 100,000 in the Chinese city of Shantou. The famines were exacerbated by lack of relief and political decisions that left many to starve. “Were these events’ mortality impacts primarily driven by climate or political conditions?” Delforge asked. “Is it appropriate to base contemporary policy decisions on climate change on four events that occurred in China and the Soviet Union during the 1920s?” Factchecks by Reuters and USA Today about similar claims on death rates made by others have found them to be false or misleading.

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,714,The pope wants Ukraine to surrender. That would give Russia a green light for endless war | Nathalie Tocci,"The suggestion from Pope Francis that Ukraine should have the “courage” to raise the “white flag” and negotiate a settlement with (in other words, surrender to) Russia was deeply shocking for Kyiv and its backers. The understandably outraged response from Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was that the only flag Kyiv would raise was its own: the yellow and blue of Ukraine. Some may think that the pope’s words are inconsequential to how this war unfolds. It is not the first time Pope Francis has displayed overtly pro-Russian sympathies, nor has the Vatican’s mediation, for instance regarding the liberation of Ukrainian children kidnapped by Russia, been successful so far. So what if the pope speaks out again about the war, given that his views are already known and his practical efforts to address the humanitarian dimensions of the war have failed? Yet the pope’s words are extremely relevant, and dangerously so. First, they provide moral cover to an unabashedly pro-Kremlin line that runs deep in some quarters in the west, from Trumpian Republicans in the US to the nationalist right and populist left in Europe, to the point of being almost mainstream in countries like my own, Italy. Claiming that the war can only end with Ukraine’s surrender is precisely what Vladimir Putin has been preaching for more than two years. The fact that a religious authority such as the Vatican toes the same line provides incredible political ammunition to the Kremlin and its cheerleaders in Europe and beyond. Second, the pope’s words matter because they reflect views that are widespread in the global south. In fact, rather than a pro-Russian sentiment, what the pope projects is a deep-rooted anti-westernism. This consequently taints his reading of the war, with its emphasis on Nato’s presumed culpability and the agenda of the western military-industrial complex. The west’s failure to persuasively make its case in the global south is a problem for it, especially as the views and voices of the south matter more and more in today’s international relations. The problem has been greatly exacerbated by the US and Europe’s unwillingness to halt Israel’s catastrophic war in Gaza. Precisely because the pope’s words matter, it’s important to say why he’s wrong. I believe he’s wrong on the past, the present and perhaps most importantly the future. The pope betrays his underlying beliefs on the past causes of the war through both admission and omission. Two years since the invasion began, Ukraine is, it is now generally accepted, struggling on the battlefront. Some could claim that the pope’s call for surrender is therefore purely driven by detached political realism (perhaps an odd theoretical tradition for a religious authority, but nevertheless), so it is better to give in now than to persevere in defeat. However, if realism is really what motivates the pope, why didn’t he call on Russia to surrender and withdraw when its first attempt to subjugate Ukraine failed and Ukraine recaptured about half of the territory it lost in the first few weeks of the invasion? When the pope talks of Ukraine raising the white flag while making no mention whatsoever of Russia, what he’s actually doing is perversely blaming Ukraine (and the west) for provoking Russia into war (for instance, by aspiring to enter Nato), totally neglecting the imperial ambitions that drove the Kremlin to invade Ukraine. Yet the past is past, and there’s probably nothing that can change strongly held beliefs on the causes of the war. Those, like the pope, who believe that the west is to blame for it all, will probably continue to do so regardless of the evidence produced to prove the opposite. However, the pontiff’s mistakes are not limited to its causes. The war’s present dynamic, and particularly Ukraine’s problems on the frontline, stems from the fact that the western military-industrial complex, reviled by the pope, has done too little, not too much. Rather than the west’s defence industry fuelling war, Ukraine’s recent losses are due to a lack of manpower and especially a lack of weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion. Europe’s defence industry has not been put on a war footing (unlike Russia’s), while the US Congress still holds $60bn in military aid to Kyiv hostage to domestic political wrangling. There is nothing preordained in the war’s outcome, as the pope implies: if Ukraine is losing, it’s down to the fact that its artillery fire is a fraction of what it was last summer, and while the west dithers, Russia has replenished its military stocks and North Korea has sent Moscow roughly 1.5m shells. Ukraine needs weapons not “just” to defend its frontline, but also to protect the civilian population that should be dear to the pope. It’s thanks to western air defences that Ukraine can protect its citizens and civilian infrastructure across the country from Russian drone and missile strikes. It’s also thanks to western military capabilities that Ukraine has knocked out about a third of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, ensuring that grain can continue flowing to the global south, despite Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative last year. Looking to the future, the pope assumes that a Ukrainian surrender would put an end to the war, presumably via a deal allowing Russia to retain control of the five Ukrainian regions it has annexed illegally, and perhaps a few more (like Odesa). These are the kind of terms Donald Trump would probably also like to see. Of course, no one has a crystal ball. Yet if Putin’s past behaviour is any indication, there’s no evidence whatsoever to suggest this would represent a steady state ending the war. Sign up to This is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion What the pope chooses to forget is that this is not the first war that Putin has waged in Europe, beginning with Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. Every time the west sidelined and played down the Russian threat, Moscow came back to bite off a bigger piece. Likewise, the pope neglects Russia’s military buildup, which European intelligence claims could pose a direct threat to Nato in a few years’ time. In short, even in the morally reprehensible scenario in which the pope’s words are heeded and the west throws Ukraine under the bus, all signals point to the fact that this would not lead to peace in Europe. More likely it would open up the continent to an even more dangerous and deadly phase of this unjust war.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,715,"‘This music survived in a network of phones’: El Wali, the shapeshifting voice of Saharan struggle","Lying in a tent erected outside his house, Maulud Emhamed Sidi Bashir is listening to a small silver handheld radio. In the Sahrawi refugee camps near Tindouf in south-western Algeria, people often set up traditional tents like this on the doorsteps of newer buildings. The crackling electric guitar notes Bashir, 75, is listening to are a similar mix of traditional and modern. Many of the songs, his relatives say, are by a band called El Wali. It can take a while to figure out what, exactly, El Wali is. There is not much information on Google and only one album on YouTube (without the names of the singers or musicians). The very place where the band originated, the Western Sahara, is a question mark to most people. But El Wali has become a sort of national orchestra, a group whose songs don’t have credits and don’t belong to anybody; a shapeshifting entity that changes members over generations. Driving through the Hamada desert, Lud Mahmud, a member of the independence movement Polisario Front, tries to explain. He points to the camp spread across the flat rocky plain. “This is El Wali,” he says. A few kilometres later, at the next camp, he says again: “This is El Wali.” The concept is clear: everything is El Wali when it comes to Polisario music. Some members stay in the band longer than others, but there have been so many that each camp has certainly provided more than one. Situated between Morocco and Mauritania, this desert was a Spanish province – and one of the last European colonies in Africa – until 1975, when Spain handed it over to Morocco. The Western Sahara’s native people, the Sahrawis, were a mixture of nomadic tribes with almost no concept of nation before Morocco forced them from their land. In the late 1970s, they found refuge in south-western Algeria, where, unified by the common enemy, they laid the foundations of a new nation, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Led by the leftwing Polisario Front, they started a guerrilla war against Morocco that lasts to this day. The conflict has recently intensified, especially after the then-US President Donald Trump recognised Moroccan claims over the territory in 2020. Although largely forgotten by the international community, this is one of Africa’s longest wars and a continuing fight against colonisation (Western Sahara is considered by the UN a non-self-governing territory, essentially a colony of Morocco). Bashir and Mahmud were among the tens of thousands of people who had to leave their houses in Western Sahara and flee to the camps in Algeria, where the Polisario used music to help spark a national identity. Traditional poetry, infused with lyrics about the struggle against Morocco, was adapted into songs. The result was a stunning arrangement of western and local instruments played by a band that would soon take the name of El Wali. “I came from the bullets,” says Ahdaidhum Abaid Lagtab, a former member of El Wali, during a performance given by the current iteration of the band in the Sahrawi refugee camp of Laayoune. “I came in the middle of the occupation – and I remember the dead Sahrawis.” At the age of 16, Lagtab, like Bashir, escaped from the advance of the Moroccan army in the mid 1970s. “We didn’t sing about specific politics,” she adds, “but about society. We talked about freedom.” She joined El Wali in 1979, when the band was already active, with around a dozen members, and had taken the name of the co-founder and most famous martyr of the Polisario Front: El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed. With the look of a rock star and the charisma of Che Guevara, he galvanised the incipient nation before he was killed in 1976 aged about 28 during a raid. He is still the Sahrawis’ hero par excellence. Accustomed to a world of contracts and copyrights, breakups and reunions, we tend to frame a band in a definite space and time. For El Wali, this is not the case. “At the beginning, it was work for the nation, organised by the nation,” explains Salma Mohamed Said, AKA Shueta, a veteran singer and drummer who started with El Wali at its inception. “Each district would choose an artist to join the national band. Some would play traditional instruments, such as the drums. Others would play modern instruments, like the guitar and keyboard. The traditional balanced the modern.” Sitting in her living room, furnished with large carpets and cushions, Shueta remembers the 1980s and early 1990s with the band: “We played in concerts from Libya to South Africa, from Portugal to East Germany to North Korea.” In 1994, El Wali went to Belgium for a recording session organised by Oxfam. “I remember Shueta and the band,” says Hilt Teuwen, who managed the production. “I had met them in the camps and invited them to Belgium. The result was a very good quality recording.” This was a fabulous album called Tiris, 13 songs played with three singers, electric guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and tidinit, a traditional Sahrawi lute. It is a mix of joyful yet nostalgic tunes that tell the origins of the war against Morocco and the story of a people in exile dreaming of independence. “We kept in touch for a while, then the composition of the band changed – but El Wali as such still exists.” The world – or at least the west – would have probably lost track of Tiris if it wasn’t for a self-described “guerrilla ethnomusicologist” and producer from Oregon named Christopher Kirkley. Around 2009, Kirkley was touring the Sahel (a stretch of the southern Sahara) and west Africa to collect samples of local music for an album series called Music from Saharan Cellphones. “At that time,” he says, “the internet wasn’t very widespread in the region. But mobiles and Bluetooth were, and people used them to listen to and exchange music. The only way to get songs was to copy them from one phone to another. It was a network.” During his research, songs from El Wali kept popping up on memory cards and sims but Kirkley wasn’t aware of who the performers were at the time. “There wasn’t much information; they were often just titled Polisario.” According to Kirkley, Sahrawi music helped introduce the region to the electric guitar, which really took hold in west Africa in the 1990s. A lot of the better-known Tuareg guitar music – sometimes known as desert blues or Tuareg rock, played by the likes of Mdou Moctar and Grammy-nominated Tinariwen – was hugely influenced by Sahrawi guitar music. “Especially the upbeat and kind of reggae rhythm, those have an origin in Sahrawi music,” he says. “It was the definitive sound of Western Sahara.” After releasing Music from Saharan Cellphones Volume Two in 2012, he began an eight-year investigative journey to retrace the origins of those Sahrawi songs so in vogue on the region’s mobiles. Through people who were working in NGOs in Western Sahara, he got in touch with Sahrawi music producer Hamdi Salama, who introduced him to Ali Mohammed (the guitarist on El Wali’s Tiris), who told him about the recording session in Belgium with Oxfam. The studio engineer, Pierre Jonckheer, who recorded the album, happened to have a copy of Tiris on CD. “You couldn’t find any references to this CD anywhere in the world, it disappeared from the internet and any western media,” Kirkley says. “There is something fascinating in a music resonating and surviving on a network of phones. Without it, it probably wouldn’t ever have this second life.” In 2019, Kirkley and Salama rereleased El Wali’s Tiris, now available on Spotify and YouTube, where this whole story began. They are now working on a new release of music from the Sahrawi band. “The new album that we want to release was made by completely different people,” says Kirkley. “It’s confusing because you have to bring it to an audience and say: ‘Yes, this is also El Wali.’” Back in the desert, a large national parade is being held to mark the 50th anniversary of the Sahrawis’ struggle against occupation. The day is dominated by the military with armed vehicles carrying outdated rockets past onlookers who gather on top of cars under the punishing sun. The night, though, belongs to music. Shueta takes the stage, as she has many times before, to sing from exile. Much of the crowd is too young to ever have seen the homeland her lyrics speak of, but each strum of electric guitar carries with it the shimmering promise of a Sahrawi state and the unbroken music of El Wali.",2024-03-13 10:45:49,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/13/el-wali-the-shapeshifting-voice-of-saharan-struggle,The Guardian,715,lying tent outside house sidi listening small silver radio refugee near southwestern people often set traditional like crackling electric guitar 75 listening similar mix traditional modern many say band el wali take figure exactly el wali much information one album without place band western question mark people el wali become sort national orchestra group whose dont dont belong anybody entity driving desert member independence movement front explain camp spread across flat rocky plain el wali later next camp el wali concept clear everything el wali come music stay band longer many camp certainly provided one situated morocco desert province one last 1975 handed morocco western native people mixture nomadic almost concept nation morocco forced land late 1970s found refuge southwestern unified common enemy laid new nation democratic republic sadr led front guerrilla war morocco day conflict recently especially president trump territory 2020 although largely forgotten international community one fight western considered un territory essentially colony morocco among people leave western flee used music help spark national identity traditional poetry struggle morocco result stunning arrangement western local band would soon take name el wali came former member el wali performance given current iteration band refugee camp came middle occupation remember dead age 16 like advance army mid 1970s didnt sing specific politics society freedom el wali 1979 band already active around dozen taken name cofounder famous martyr front look rock star charisma che incipient nation 1976 aged 28 raid still hero par excellence accustomed world tend frame band definite space time el wali case beginning work nation nation salma said aka veteran singer drummer el wali inception district would choose artist join national band would play traditional would play modern like guitar keyboard traditional balanced modern sitting living room furnished large 1980s early 1990s band south east north korea 1994 el wali went recording session remember band hilt production met result good quality recording fabulous album 13 three electric guitar bass keyboard traditional lute mix joyful yet nostalgic tell war morocco story people exile independence kept touch composition band el wali still world least west would probably lost track wasnt guerrilla producer around 2009 touring stretch southern west collect local music album series music time wasnt widespread region people used listen exchange music way get copy one phone another network research el wali kept memory wasnt aware time wasnt much information often titled according music introduce region electric guitar really took hold west 1990s lot guitar music sometimes known desert blue rock hugely guitar music especially upbeat kind rhythm origin music definitive sound western music volume two 2012 investigative journey retrace vogue people working western got touch music producer guitarist el told recording session studio engineer album copy find anywhere world western medium something fascinating music surviving network without probably wouldnt ever second life 2019 el available whole story working new release music band new album want release made completely different people bring audience say yes also el wali back desert large national parade mark 50th anniversary struggle occupation day dominated military armed carrying outdated past gather top sun night though music stage many time sing exile much crowd young ever seen homeland speak strum electric guitar shimmering promise state unbroken music el wali music network el wali voice struggle
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,716,Collapse at regional mine – as it happened,"Thank you for joining us on the live blog today – here is a wrap of the main news: Authorities are working to rescue two people trapped under rock after a collapse in a regional Victorian mine. Aerial searches will resume for seven people who are missing amid flooding in remote Western Australia after severe weather hampered efforts. The billionaire mining magnate Clive Palmer has vowed to build a vessel “far, far superior than the original” as he unveiled designs for his Titanic II project – again. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said Australia has been “mugged by reality” over the Aukus submarine deal after the US announced it will halve the number of submarines it will build next year. Four federal politicians have defended taxpayer-funded trips that allowed them to attend the 2022 Melbourne Cup, costing more than $5,000 in accommodation and transport. The lives of detainees in Australia’s immigration detention centres are controlled by a secret rating system that is opaque and often riddled with errors, a Guardian investigation has found. The minister responsible for Victoria’s Suburban Rail Loop cannot say how much the underground railway will cost, despite lashing an independent analysis that suggested building and running the first two stages will total more than $216bn. See you bright and early tomorrow. Search to resume for seven people missing in WA floods The search for seven missing people – including four children – in Western Australia will resume in the next two hours, after delays due to severe weather conditions. Two vehicles, a beige-coloured Toyota LandCruiser and a white Mitsubishi Triton, were believed to have left Kalgoorlie-Boulder on Sunday between 10am and 2pm, making for Tjuntjuntjara, police said on Tuesday. Both vehicles contained elderly drivers, with the Mitsubishi Triton also containing five other passengers, four of whom are children aged between seven and 17. WA police says its air wing and the local Kalgoorlie helicopter and air services have now been deployed to search the vast area between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Tjuntjuntjara, which are around 650km apart. The road between the two areas is still dangerous. Suburban Rail Loop minister rubbishes cost blowout report The minister responsible for Victoria’s Suburban Rail Loop cannot say how much the underground railway will cost, despite lashing an independent analysis that suggested building and running the first two stages will total more than $216bn. Analysis from Victoria’s Parliamentary Budget Office, prepared for the state’s opposition leader, John Pesutto, suggested that building the first two stages of the railway from Cheltenham to Box Hill and then on to Melbourne airport would cost $96.4bn. An additional $120.2bn would be required to operate the line for 50 years. This was $16.5bn more than was forecast by the PBO in 2022, and well above the $50bn the government said it would cost to construct the entire 90km underground railway when it announced the project in 2018. Here’s Pesutto: The Labor government told the Victorian people that the SRL would cost $50bn. We’re now seeing with each new report the cost continues to blow up. The sensible and responsible thing for the Allan Labor government is to stop this project urgently. To proceed stubbornly, hellbent on a project that just doesn’t stack up but will rack up the debt, is highly irresponsible. The Suburban Rail Loop minister, Danny Pearson, rubbished the costings and said the government was forging ahead: John Pesutto is making yet another tired, lazy attempt to discredit a project that Victorians have voted for at the last two previous elections. Two people have been trapped under rock after a collapse in a regional mine, the Victorian Country Fire Authority has confirmed. The CFA responded to a call at about 4.50pm that reported two people were trapped underground at the Indicator Lane mine at Mt Clear, Ballarat. Ambulance Victoria and Victoria police are also on scene. The mine at Mt Clear is a goldmine owned by Victory Minerals Pty Ltd. Super funds must demand Woodside and Santos abandon expansion plans, activists say Gas giants Woodside Energy and Santos make up a bigger share of the Australian share market than ever but are attracting a smaller proportion of superannuation savings than other large companies. As AAP reports, research released by Market Forces has found the biggest super funds are going cold on the two “climate wreckers” by dedicating a decreasing share of their members’ investments to them. The shareholder activist organisation is ramping up pressure on big carbon emitters and their stakeholders ahead of the next round of annual general meetings. Here’s the group’s campaigner, Brett Morgan: Super funds must demand and deliver an end to Woodside and Santos’s oil and gas expansion plans and publicly divest if they fail to comply. NSW calls on commonwealth to come to the table on school funding The New South Wales deputy premier and minister for education, Prue Car, has warned the commonwealth to come to the table on school funding lest her state feels it has been “forgotten”. Car said it was heartening to see the federal government’s decision to double public school funding in the Northern Territory, which would provide “extraordinary assistance” amid chronic resourcing issues. But she backed her counterparts in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania who have demanded a 5% increase to meet 100% of the schooling resource standard (SRS). In NSW, the commonwealth currently covers 20% of funding for public schools, while the state government is expanding its commitment to 75% by 2026, leaving a 5% gap. We are pushing for our relatively modest request … given yesterday’s decision by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to recommend a record cut in GST funding to NSW, coming to the table on public schools funding for NSW would be a good place for the commonwealth to start in reassuring the people of NSW that they have not forgotten the country’s largest state. NSW treasurer protests cut in GST revenue from federal government The NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, is continuing to complain about a cut in GST revenue that has made the state government’s surplus “virtually impossible”. On Tuesday, the commonwealth grants commission released its latest report on the carve-up of GST between the states and territories. Decisions of the independent commission are applied by the federal government as a matter of course, despite protests from states losing GST, which this year includes New South Wales and Queensland. Here’s what Mookhey told the ABC a few moments ago: I think we need an explanation from the federal government as to why New South Wales is losing out when it comes to infrastructure, why it’s losing out when it comes to health agreements, why it’s losing out when it comes to education agreements. The reason why we are speaking out about all this is because it does have very serious implications for our capacity to deliver services to the people of New South Wales. State education ministers say commonwealth should increasing public school funding Education ministers are standing firm that the commonwealth should front a 5% increase to public schools after the federal government sealed its second funding deal with the Northern Territory. Under the statements of intent, WA has agreed to a 2.5% commonwealth funding boost to reach the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS), while the NT will have its funding doubled to 40% due to the additional need. But Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales have resisted a 2.5% boost, instead demanding the federal government up its funding by 5% before they agree to their own increases. South Australia’s minister for education, Blair Boyer, said the state “deserves its fair share of funding” from the commonwealth. That’s what I’m fighting for with my colleagues from Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and the ACT. Public schools are for every child … these students deserve the right funding levels. $190m extra per year for public schools would be a gamechanger for SA. It would mean more support for students and more support for teachers. It will change lives. Queensland’s education minister, Di Farmer, said the NT deal demonstrated the commonwealth could break the previous government’s cap of allocating 20% of SRS funding to public schools. Queensland has a continued commitment that the federal government will provide a 5% increase to 25% so that all state schools in Queensland can achieve 100% funding. Tasmania’s minister for education, Roger Jaensch, similarly said the state’s position “has not changed”. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has rejected suggestions the Biden administration is “backsliding” on its commitment to provide nuclear submarines under the Aukus deal. The US has announced it will halve the number of submarines it will build next year, throwing the Australia end of the agreement into doubt. The Pentagon budget draft request includes construction of just one Virginia-class nuclear submarine for 2025. Marles has been speaking about this to the ABC: The fact that the American industrial base is stretched in 2024, as it was in 2023 when we made this announcement, is not news. It formed part of the landscape against which this arrangement was agreed a year ago. I think what’s important to see in the budget that’s been put forward by the Biden administration is an $11bn commitment over the next five years to grow the industrial capacity within the United States to produce Virginia-class submarines, which will see an increase over that time in the tempo of Virginia-class submarines produced. That’s what we need to see. That’s as expected. A Sunshine Coast man has been charged with 116 offences against multiple children, including rape, indecent treatment, stalking and taking a child for immoral purposes. Queensland police alleged the 31-year-old had been actively targeting minors online since August 2023. He was arrested in February by the child protection investigation unit (CPIU) and taken into custody. The man has been refused police bail and is due to reappear in Maroochydore magistrates court on 18 March. Under Queensland law, a person is guilty of taking a child for immoral purposes who “entices away or detains a child who is under the age of 16 years and is not the husband or wife of that person” for the purposes of intercourse or indecent treatment. Clive Palmer ‘sure’ high court challenge against electoral spending laws will be launched Mining billionaire and one-time federal MP Clive Palmer has said he’s “sure” that “someone” will mount a high court challenge against the federal government’s electoral spending laws. Palmer held a press conference in Sydney earlier today to re-announce his plans to build a true-to-life replica of the Titanic, where he fielded questions from journalists about his history of making lavish political donations. Palmer, who donated more than $110m to his United Australia Party before the last federal election, criticised Labor’s plan to limit the amount of money a donor can give to a political party. He said: I think that’s contrary to what the high court said about [the] implied right of political free speech in Australia. So I’m sure that will be challenged by someone in the high court. Not necessarily me, maybe, but I’m sure it will be. Asked if he was trying to intimidate the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, out of introducing the legislation, Palmer said: I don’t think you can intimidate someone as steely-eyed as Mr Albanese, someone as strong and full of his faculty, I couldn’t possibly intimidate him. The real question should be, is he trying to intimidate me? Is he trying to intimidate Australians? We know that what the Liberal party and the Labor party would like in this country is to have a monopoly on public debate.

As AAP reports, the 90km orbital rail line is Victoria’s most expensive infrastructure project, designed to run from Cheltenham in Victoria’s south-east to Werribee in the southwest via Melbourne Airport. The first two stages, SRL East and North, will cost an extra $9bn to build and maintain and $7.5bn to run over the next 50 years, according to Victoria’s independent Parliamentary Budget Office. The analysis, requested by the state opposition, is an update to its 2022 report that calculated construction and operational costs for the first two stages at $200bn. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Henry Belot will take you through the rest of today’s coverage. Take care. Australians lost $15.9m to social media scams in three months, report says Consumer group Choice says urgent government action is needed after $15.9m was lost to social media scams in October to December last year, according to a National Anti-Scam Centre quarterly report. Choice argues that digital platforms should be forced to prevent scam losses. Their senior campaigns and policy advisor, Alex Soderlund, said it was “disappointing” platforms are “refusing to come to the table to stop scammers exploiting their tools”: From October to December last year, social media scams made up a huge 20% of losses for the quarter. In 2023, social media scam losses stole $95m, a 249% increase since 2020. 76% of 2023’s losses were through Meta-owned companies. We continue to see an overwhelming number of likely scam ads across Meta and Google-owned services. Big tech companies have a perverse incentive not to act on scams because they generate advertising revenue, so it’s clear that only strong mandatory rules to prevent scams developed and enforced by a regulator will result in any meaningful change for consumers. According to the report, a majority of the social media scams in 2023 occurred via Whatsapp (47% of losses), Facebook (20%), online dating sites (9%) and Instagram (9%). During the October to December period, people over 65 experienced the highest losses of any age group at 30% of all social media scam losses – a 57% increase compared to the previous quarter for this age group. Former US Marine Brian Earl Johnston has been sentenced to life in prison, with a non-parole period of 20 years, for the 2021 murder of his estranged wife, Kelly Wilkinson.The Queensland supreme court heard that Johnston “intended” to kill Wilkinson, and that he had gone to her home armed with weapons, duct tape, zip ties and a sedative. He was carrying a 20 litre can of petrol, which he poured on Wilkinson and set her on fire. Justice Peter Applegarth said: I find that you intended to kill her, and then kill yourself. Something you failed to achieve. Johnston was also sentenced to three years in prison for breaching a domestic violence protection order. Asbestos has been detected at two central Queensland facilities after a investigation by the state government. Queensland’s Department of Environment and innovation (DESI) confirmed asbestos was detected in a mulch stockpile at Emu Park transfer station after a joint inspection program by DESI and Workplace Health and Safety Queensland. Livingstone shire council has closed the station as a precaution while DESI investigates. The department said a small number of residents had picked up mulch from the transfer station over recent weeks. The contaminated material is believed to be bonded asbestos, which is less deadly than friable asbestos. Asbestos has also been detected at NuGrow Rockhampton. The department said the samples were not part of a stockpile and are not believed to have left the site. Saws down as Victoria’s forest logging firm gets the chop Victoria’s state-owned logging company will shut down within months, AAP reports. A 30 June end date was revealed this morning during a court hearing involving VicForests and environmental group Wombat Forestcare. The winding-up of the body is part of the Victorian government’s decision to end native forest logging, which took effect on 1 January. Stand-down payments to VicForests contractors are due to end on 30 June. The Victorian Greens’ deputy leader, Ellen Sandell, accused VicForests of being “environmental vandals” and said it was about time they were shut down: We now need Labor to focus its environment

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,717,Birdwatch: rare black-faced spoonbill turns up in Hong Kong wetland,"I opened the windows to the hide and was greeted by a mass of birds. Hundreds of cormorants, gulls, herons, egrets, ducks and waders, all feeding frantically as the rising tide covered up the fertile mud. Overhead, black kites patrolled half-heartedly, occasionally provoking the other birds to take to the wing in short-lived panic, before settling back down to feed or rest. I witnessed this spectacle at the World Wide Fund for Nature’s Mai Po nature reserve in Hong Kong, justly celebrated as one of the most important wetlands in the world. Either side of high tide, birds gather here in vast numbers against the backdrop of Shenzhen, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, just across the border in mainland China. Among the commoner species I spotted a spoonbill, but not the version I am familiar with. As it fed, sweeping its curious, spatulate bill from side to side in the shallow waters, I could see a distinctive dark face, contrasting with its white plumage, which marked this bird out as something different. The black-faced spoonbill is by far the rarest member of its family, with fewer than 6,000 individuals on the planet. Soon it will head back north to the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea where it can breed undisturbed. Hopefully, next autumn, it will return to Mai Po, a welcome haven in a world where wetland habitats are under constant threat.",2024-03-13 06:00:06,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/13/birdwatch-rare-black-faced-spoonbill-turns-up-in-hong-kong-wetland,The Guardian,717,hide mass feeding frantically rising tide covered fertile mud overhead black halfheartedly occasionally provoking take wing panic settling back feed rest spectacle world wide fund po nature reserve hong justly celebrated one important world either side high tide gather vast backdrop one world across border china among commoner specie spotted spoonbill version familiar fed sweeping curious spatulate bill side side shallow could see distinctive dark face white plumage marked bird something different spoonbill far member family 6000 planet soon head back north zone north south korea breed undisturbed hopefully next autumn return po welcome world constant threat rare spoonbill turn hong
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,718,Robert Hur says he ‘did not exonerate’ Biden and refuses to rule out role in a Trump administration – as it happened,"In his opening statement, former special counsel Robert Hur defended his descriptions of Joe Biden’s memory and its relevance in his report as “necessary, accurate and fair”. Hur said: There has been a lot of attention paid to language in the report about the president’s memory, so let me say a few words about that. My task was to determine whether the president retained or disclosed national defense information “willfully” – meaning, knowingly and with the intent to do something the law forbids. I could not make that determination without assessing the president’s state of mind. Hur said that for that reason, he had to “consider the president’s memory and overall mental state, and how a jury likely would perceive his memory and mental state in a criminal trial”. He added: My assessment in the report about the relevance of the president’s memory was necessary and accurate and fair. Most importantly, what I wrote is what I believe the evidence shows, and what I expect jurors would perceive and believe. I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the president unfairly. I explained to the attorney general my decision and the reasons for it. That’s what I was required to do. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Robert Hur, the justice department special counsel assigned to report on Joe Biden’s possession of classified documents, told Congress he was just doing his job when he shook up the US election campaign by criticizing the president’s apparent inability to recall certain events. In his opening statement, Hur defended his descriptions of Biden’s memory issues and the relevance of them to his investigation and in his report as “necessary, accurate and fair”. Appearing before the House judiciary committee, Hur said his investigation into Biden “did not exonerate” the president despite declining to charge him. Hur declined to rule out accepting a role in a potential second Trump administration. Hur was appointed as a US attorney by Donald Trump in 2017. A transcript of Hur’s interview with Biden shows the president repeatedly said he never meant to retain classified information after he left the vice-presidency, but he was at times fuzzy about dates and said he was unfamiliar with the paper trail for some of the sensitive documents he handled. Ken Buck, the hard-right Republican congressman of Colorado, announced he will leave Congress at the end of next week, putting the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House in further jeopardy. The Pentagon will send a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $300m, the White House announced, the first such move in months as fresh funds for weapons have stalled in the House because of Republican opposition. The White House’s announcement that the US will send a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $300m marks the first such move in months as fresh funds for weapons have stalled in the House because of Republican opposition. It comes as Ukraine is running dangerously low on munitions, and after months of statements from US officials that the it wouldn’t be able to resume weapons deliveries until Congress provided the additional replenishment funds. The aid announcement comes as Polish leaders are in Washington to press the US to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, met on Tuesday with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate and was to meet with Joe Biden later in the day. Donald Trump’s second White House chief of staff tried to stop him from praising Adolf Hitler in part by trying to convince the then president that Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist dictator, was “a great guy in comparison”. “He said, ‘Well, but Hitler did some good things,’” the retired marine general John Kelly told Jim Sciutto of CNN in an interview for a new book. I said, ‘Well, what?’ And he said, ‘Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.’ But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said, ‘Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing. I mean, Mussolini was a great guy in comparison.’ Kelly, a retired US Marine Corps general, was homeland security secretary in the Trump administration before becoming Trump’s second chief of staff. Resigning at the end of 2018, he eventually became a public opponent of his former boss. Kelly told Sciutto it was “pretty hard to believe” Trump “missed the Holocaust” in his assessment of Hitler, “and pretty hard to understand how he missed the 400,000 American GIs that were killed in the European theatre” of the second world war. But I think it’s more … the tough guy thing.” Trump’s liking for authoritarian leaders, in particular Vladimir Putin of Russia, is well known. His remarks to Kelly about Hitler – like his former practice of keeping a book of Hitler’s speeches by his bed – have been reported before. The Biden campaign is feeling good about Robert Hur’s testimony before the House judiciary committee today, a campaign official has told CNN. After nearly five hours, the House judiciary committee has adjourned its meeting and former special counsel Robert Hur has been released. Reaction is coming in to the announcement that Colorado Republican representative Ken Buck is leaving Congress before the end of the month. One GOP-er called it “alarming”. GOP Rep. Pat Fallon reacts to Ken Buck leaving Congress next week: “Very surprising. Very disturbing. Very alarming. Very concerning.”Meanwhile, a Democratic operative texts this: pic.twitter.com/1oA1oRfrrT Buck announced last November that he wouldn’t stand for re-election but gave no indication then that he would leave before the end of his term. He cited the dysfunction of Congress in general but also slammed the Republican party as it “continues to rely on this lie that the 2020 election was stolen” by Joe Biden from Donald Trump. Buck is currently questioning Robert Hur in the judiciary committee hearing. Rep. Ken Buck “I think this place is dysfunctional...Instead of operating in a professional manner, this place has devolved into this bickering and nonsense and not really doing the job for the American people.” pic.twitter.com/VWoHGF5PkR The House judiciary committee hearing has resumed in the questioning of now-former special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Joe Biden’s having kept hold of classified documents after he left office as the US vice-president. Hur concluded that the US president should not be punished, which enraged Republicans, but justified that decision by saying, essentially, that a jury would find Biden too forgetful, because of his age, to be able to conclude that he committed a crime. “I stand by every word in the document,” Hur said in testimony at the hearing. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the fresh consignment of $300m of weapons that the US is dispatching to Ukraine won’t last long. The weaponry including artillery ammunition will “maybe only last for a couple of weeks”, Sullivan said during a media briefing at the White House. Meanwhile, the outgoing Senate minority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, has just urged the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, to hold a vote in the lower chamber on the stalled bill that supplies new aid to US allies Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Reuters reports. The US Senate gave final approval to a $95bn wartime aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, including Taiwan, last month and sent the bill to the Republican-controlled House, where it screeched to a halt amid rightwing opposition. Sullivan has left the west wing briefing room now and White House the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, is answering questions that focus more on US domestic topics. The Pentagon will rush about $300m in weapons to Ukraine after finding some cost savings in its contracts, the Associated Press reports. The relatively small input will happen even though the US military remains deeply overdrawn and needs at least $10bn to replenish all the weapons it has pulled from its stocks to help Kyiv in its desperate fight against Russia, the White House announced a little earlier.It’s the Pentagon’s first announced security package for Ukraine since December, when it acknowledged it was out of replenishment funds. It wasn’t until recent days that officials publicly acknowledged they weren’t just out of replenishment funds, but overdrawn. The announcement comes as Ukraine is running dangerously low on munitions and efforts to get fresh funds for weapons have stalled in the House because of Republican opposition. US officials have insisted for months that the United States wouldn’t be able to resume weapons deliveries until Congress provided additional replenishment funds, which are part of a large supplemental package stalled in Congress. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, in announcing the $300m in additional aid: When Russian troops advance and its guns fire, Ukraine does not have enough ammunition to fire back. The aid announcement comes as Polish leaders are in Washington to press the US to break its impasse over replenishing funds for Ukraine at a critical moment in the war. Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, met on Tuesday with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate and was to meet with Joe Biden later in the day.The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, has so far refused to bring the $95bn package, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, to the floor. Republican congressman Ken Buck of Colorado is leaving Congress short of his elected term, he announced within the last half hour. Buck is a hard-right representative. He had already announced that he would not seek re-election but now he’s leaving much sooner, putting the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House in further jeopardy. Here’s the congressman’s post on X/Twitter: Statement from Congressman Ken Buck on his departure from Congress. pic.twitter.com/orjSzenZnv The congressional hearing for former special counsel Robert Hur to be questioned about his report into Joe Biden’s retention of classified documents after leaving the vice-presidency has taken a recess for lunch. There are some unrelated votes to be taken in the House and the hearing will resume after those this afternoon but without an exact time given. Here’s where things stand: National security adviser Jake Sullivan is now briefing the media in the west wing, and will be followed by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. We’ll bring you highlights. Robert Hur declined to engage in Republicans’ questions at the hearing in front of the House judiciary committee about whether Joe Biden is “senile”. Asked whether he found that Biden was senile, after interviewing the US president at length about how he hung on to classified documents after his vice-presidency, Hur said: “I did not. That conclusion does not appear in my report.” Hur said he “did not exonerate” Biden in his report. Hur interrupted Pramila Jayapal, the Democrat congresswoman from Washington, when she said Hur’s report amounted to a “complete exoneration” of the president. Hur shot back: “I did not exonerate him. That word does not appear in my report.” Hur declined to rule out accepting a role in a potential second Trump administration. Hur was appointed as a US attorney by Donald Trump in 2017. Trump is running for re-election to a second term as a Republican president. In his opening statement, Hur defended his descriptions of Joe Biden’s memory issues and the relevance of them to his investigation and in his report as “necessary, accurate and fair”. Hur is testifying before the House judiciary committee as a private citizen after leaving the justice department. According to a report by the Independent, Hur arranged his departure from the justice department to be official as of Monday, 11 March. Jerry Nadler, the Democrat House judiciary committee ranking member, began his opening statement at the hearing by saying that House Republicans are “desperate to convince America that white conservative men are on the losing end of a two-tiered justice system, a theory … that has no basis in reality”. Nadler opined that Biden “probably committed a verbal slip or two” in his interviews with Hur.",2024-03-12

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,719,Russia-Ukraine war: Russian schools in Kursk close after claims of Ukrainian cross-border incursion – as it happened,"Schools in the Russian city of Kursk are switching to online classes after an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the region, the TASS news agency cited local authorities as saying. Ukraine-based armed groups claimed on Tuesday they had crossed the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, while Russia said it had prevented such incursions. The Kursk region also came under attack from Ukrainian drones overnight. Here are all the key developments in the Russia-Ukraine war today: Schools in the Russian city of Kursk are switching to online classes, local authorities said, after an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the region. Ukraine pounded targets in Russia with dozens of drones and rockets in a sweeping attack that inflicted serious damage on a major oil refinery and sought to pierce the land borders of the world’s biggest nuclear power with armed proxies. Russia said its forces prevented incursions from Ukraine on Tuesday and inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, after Ukraine-based armed groups said they had launched cross-border raids. French President Emmanuel Macron’s Ukraine strategy will be put to a symbolic vote in parliament’s lower house on Tuesday as political tensions rage in the run-up to June’s European Parliament elections. Denmark will provide a new military aid package including Caesar artillery systems and ammunition to Ukraine worth around 2.3 billion Danish crowns ($336.6 million). The United States is preparing a new military aid package for Ukraine that could be worth as much as $400 million, two US officials told Reuters. European Union countries are set to agree on a new 5 billion euro ($5.46 billion) top-up to a fund used to finance military shipments to Ukraine, the Financial Times reported. Thanks for following. I’m closing the blog for the rest of the day, but we will reopen it tomorrow morning. European Union countries are set to agree on a new 5 billion euro ($5.46 billion) top-up to a fund used to finance military shipments to Ukraine, the Financial Times has reported, citing four officials briefed on the discussions. Ukrainian Security Service said on Tuesday it has uncovered one of the largest networks in the country allegedly spreading pro-Russian “informational sabotage”, coordinated by a cleric of the minority Moscow-linked church. Reuters reports: Kyiv officials said Moscow planned to step up its informational war this spring, spreading disinformation in an attempt to divide Ukrainian society in the third year of its invasion. The SBU agency said it has exposed 15 members of the network linked to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), detaining four of them, including the cleric of a Kyiv-based temple of the minority Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). SBU said on its Telegram channel.: It is one of the largest FSB networks that has been operating in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The group was involved in spreading pro-Kremlin narratives aimed at destabilising society and inciting religious hatred, according to the agency. The church describes itself as independent, saying it cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, which supports Moscow’s war in Ukraine. A government commission has ruled that the church is still canonically linked to Russia. The international Red Cross movement is under pressure to take action against the Russian Red Cross (RRC) over close links between the group and the Kremlin’s war and propaganda machine, The Guardian’s central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker writes. The evidence includes the RRC president’s central role in a pro-Putin “patriotic” organisation, senior RRC staff who speak of the impossibility of peace with “Ukrainian Nazis”, and RRC participation in military training for children. There are also allegations, revealed in leaked Kremlin documents obtained by the Estonian publication Delfi and shared with a consortium of outlets including the Guardian, that the Kremlin plans to replace the work of the international Red Cross on Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine by funding new, puppet Red Cross organisations. n response to the previous publication of some of these allegations, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) said it was “reviewing the claims closely”. It is now under pressure from donor governments to take action against the RRC. The United States is preparing a new military aid package for Ukraine that could be worth as much as $400 million, two US officials have told Reuters. This would be the first such move in months as additional funds for Kyiv remain blocked by Republican leaders in Congress. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an announcement was expected later on Tuesday. One of the officials said that the funding for this package is from credits refunded to the Pentagon for recent purchases. Separately, leaders of US intelligence agencies urgently pressed members of the House of Representatives on Tuesday to approve additional military assistance for Ukraine, saying it would not only boost Kyiv as it fights Russia but discourage Chinese aggression. CIA Director Williams Burns told the House of Representatives’ Intelligence committee’s annual hearing on Worldwide Threats to US security: That has consequences for American interests that go ... directly to our interests in the Indo-Pacific. That kind of an outcome will stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership, and they’re going to undermine the faith that our partners and allies in the Indo Pacific have in our reliability. Russia’s elite is expecting President Vladimir Putin to reshuffle government positions to bring in younger people after what it sees as the formality of his resounding election victory this weekend, four sources close to the authorities have told Reuters. In control of all state levers and with no serious political competitors, Putin - in power as president or prime minister since the last day of 1999 - is widely expected to win what will be his fifth presidential term and another six years in power. The four sources, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject, said they expected younger people to be brought into more senior government positions, including perhaps as deputy ministers and heads of ministerial departments, and for an older generation of government officials to be demoted or retire after the election. One of the sources said ministerial portfolios were being reviewed too and that the reshuffle was expected to take place in May. Changes at major state corporations, state energy behemoths and in Russia’s more than 80 regional governorships are also seen as possible, the sources said. The Kremlin says it never comments on planned personnel changes ahead of time. At a time when Russia is waging war with Ukraine and needs continuity, two of the sources said they did not expect Putin to change his defence and foreign ministers, however. “You don’t change horses mid-stream,” said the first source, who added that it would be surprising if Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, 68, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who turns 74 later this month, did not keep their posts. In office since 2020, Mikhail Mishustin, the 58-year-old technocratic prime minister, is also expected to keep his job, they said. So is Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, three sources said. Planned changes at the top of major ministries and in security agencies will only take place after the end of what Putin calls his special military operation in Ukraine, the first source said. Denmark will provide a new military aid package including Caesar artillery systems and ammunition to Ukraine worth around 2.3 billion Danish crowns ($336.6 million), the Danish Defence Ministry has said in a statement. In Russia, Tass has reported that the foreign ministry has imposed sanctions on 347 people from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia which it claims are “hostile figures”. Tass quotes the ministry claiming: The hostile policy of the Baltic states towards Russia, active lobbying by Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia for sanctions measures against our country, interference in the internal affairs of Russia, persecution of the Russian-speaking population, a barbaric campaign for the mass demolition of monuments to Soviet liberating soldiers, rewriting history, glorifying Nazism, as well as the criminal line pursued to pump the Kyiv regime with weapons require retaliatory measures against those involved in these atrocities. Germany’s military still lacks sufficient equipment and personnel despite a €100bn (£85bn / $109bn) special fund set up after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces said on Tuesday. Reuters reports Eva Högl said “Despite the remarkable efforts, it remains to be said that substantial improvements in personnel, equipment and infrastructure are still a long way off.” Germany is in the second year of the “Zeitenwende” policy, announced by chancellor Olaf Scholz just days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It is designed to deliver a more assertive foreign policy backed by more military spending. Here are the latest images coming out of Belgorod, Russia, which according to local authorities was hit by Ukrainian drones this morning. Here are the key developments from the day so far: Schools in the Russian city of Kursk are switching to online classes, local authorities said, after an attempted Ukrainian incursion into the region. Ukraine pounded targets in Russia with dozens of drones and rockets in a sweeping attack that inflicted serious damage on a major oil refinery and sought to pierce the land borders of the world’s biggest nuclear power with armed proxies.

Ukraine-based armed groups claimed on Tuesday they had crossed the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, while Russia said it had prevented such incursions. The Kursk region also came under attack from Ukrainian drones overnight. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned Switzerland’s ambassador over the Swiss parliament’s approval of motions authorising the government to work on a way to seize and transfer Russian assets to fund reparations for Ukraine. Russia summoned Ambassador Krystyna Marty Lang to protest at the narrowly passed Swiss motions which authorised the Swiss government to work on creating a reparations mechanism in international law for a country illegally attacked. The foreign ministry said: Russia strongly condemns this step by the Swiss authorities that grossly violates the fundamental principles and norms of international law regarding state immunity. Any encroachment on Russian state property under the guise of any far-fetched ‘reparative mechanism’ would be nothing more than theft at the state level. The ministry said Russia would retaliate if the Swiss plan was implemented. The Swiss foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Switzerland said last year that it had frozen an estimated 7.7 billion Swiss francs ($8.81 billion) in financial assets belonging to Russians under sanctions designed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that Russian forces have taken control of the village of Nevelske in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, the RIA news agency reported. A Russian Il-76 military transport plane crashed in the Ivanovo region northeast of Moscow on Tuesday with 15 people on board, the Interfax news agency cited Russia’s defence ministry as saying. Another agency, TASS, cited the ministry as saying one of the plane’s engines had caught fire, causing the crash. It was unclear whether there were any survivors. Reuters has the full report on the drone strikes: Ukraine pounded targets in Russia on Tuesday with dozens of drones and rockets in a sweeping attack that inflicted serious damage on a major oil refinery and sought to pierce the land borders of the world’s biggest nuclear power with armed proxies. Russia and Ukraine have both used drones to strike critical infrastructure, military installations and troop concentrations in their more than two-year war, with Kyiv hitting Russian refineries and energy facilities in recent months. Russia said Ukrainian proxies had sought to cross the Russian border in at least seven attacks which Russian forces had repelled. The Russian-speaking Ukrainian proxies said they had breached the border, a claim denied by Russia. In one of the biggest Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia to date, Russia said it had downed 25 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions including Moscow, Leningrad, Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Tula and Oryol. Many more drone attacks were reported. Russian officials reported attacks on a slew of energy facilities, including a fire at Lukoil’s LKOH.MM NORSI refinery and a drone destroyed on the outskirts of the town of Kirishi, home to Russia’s second largest oil refinery. Gleb Nikitin, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, posted a picture of a fire truck beside the NORSI refinery and said emergency services were working to put out a blaze there. He said on Telegram: A fuel and energy complex facility was attacked by unmanned aerial vehicles. Industry sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the main crude distillation unit (AVT-6) at NORSI was damaged in the attack, which means that at least half of the refinery’s production is halted. Lukoil declined to comment. NORSI refines about 15.8 million tonnes of Russian crude a year, or 5.8% of total refined crude, according to industry sources. Striking Russian oil facilities is a problem for President Vladimir Putin as he faces off against the West over Ukraine, with domestic gasoline prices sensitive ahead of a March 15-17 presidential election. The Kremlin said the Russian military was doing everything necessary and that what it calls its military operation in Ukraine would continue. European Union leaders are ready to respond with new and significant measures against Iran amid reports that Tehran may transfer ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine, draft conclusions of a summit to be held next week said. The draft text, seen by Reuters, said: The European Council calls on third parties to immediately cease providing material support to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Reports that Iran may transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine are very concerning. The European Union is prepared to respond swiftly and in coordination with international partners, including with new and significant measures against Iran. Iran has provided Russia with a large number of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, six sources told Reuters, deepening the military cooperation between the two countries, which are both under US sanctions. The conclusions also said the leaders would call on High Representative Josep Borrell and the Commission to prepare further sanctions against Belarus, North Korea and Iran.",2024-03-12

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,720,Aide tried to stop Trump praising Hitler – by telling him Mussolini was ‘great guy’,"Donald Trump’s second White House chief of staff tried to stop him praising Adolf Hitler in part by trying to convince the then president that Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist dictator, was “a great guy in comparison”. “He said, ‘Well, but Hitler did some good things,’” the retired marine general John Kelly told Jim Sciutto of CNN in an interview for a new book. “I said, ‘Well, what?’ And he said, ‘Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.’ But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world. And I said, ‘Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing. I mean, Mussolini was a great guy in comparison.” Kelly, a retired US Marine Corps general, was homeland security secretary in the Trump administration before becoming Trump’s second chief of staff. Resigning at the end of 2018, he eventually became a public opponent of his former boss. Sciutto is a CNN anchor and national security analyst. His new book, The Return of Great Powers, will be published on Tuesday. CNN published a preview on Monday. Kelly told Sciutto it was “pretty hard to believe” Trump “missed the Holocaust” in his assessment of Hitler, “and pretty hard to understand how he missed the 400,000 American GIs that were killed in the European theatre” of the second world war. “But I think it’s more … the tough guy thing.” Trump’s liking for authoritarian leaders, in particular Vladimir Putin of Russia, is well known. His remarks to Kelly about Hitler – like his former practice of keeping a book of Hitler’s speeches by his bed – have been reported before. But Sciutto’s recounting of his conversation with Kelly comes amid resurgent fears over Trump’s authoritarian leanings, with Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee despite facing 91 criminal charges and multimillion-dollar civil defeats, and having seen off attempts to disqualify him for office. Kelly’s remarks to Sciutto were published shortly after Trump welcomed to his Florida home Viktor Orbán, the strongman leader of Hungary. Singing Trump’s praises, Orbán said that if Trump defeats Joe Biden for re-election, the US would not “give a penny” more in aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian invaders. Kelly told Sciutto Trump “thought Putin was an OK guy and Kim [Jong-un] was an OK guy … to him, it was like we were goading these guys. ‘If we didn’t have Nato, then Putin wouldn’t be doing these things.’” Trump recently said that if re-elected, he will encourage Russia to attack Nato members Trump deems not to pay enough into the alliance. Condemning those remarks as “dumb, shameful and un-American”, Biden has sought to portray Trump as a threat to world security as well as US democracy. Kelly told Sciutto: “The point is, [Trump] saw absolutely no point in Nato. He was [also] just dead set against having troops in South Korea, again, a deterrent force, or having troops in Japan, a deterrent force” to North Korea. Kelly was not the only general to fill a civil role in Trump’s administration. James Mattis, also a marine, was Trump’s first secretary of defense while HR McMaster, from the army, was Trump’s second national security adviser. Kelly told Sciutto Trump thought US generals would prove as loyal to him as German generals did to Hitler. “He would ask about the loyalty issues,” Kelly said, but “when I pointed out to him the German generals as a group were not loyal to [Hitler], and in fact tried to assassinate him a few times, he didn’t know that. “He truly believed, when he brought us generals in, that we would be loyal – that we would do anything he wanted us to do.” A Trump spokesperson told CNN Kelly had “beclowned” himself and should “seek professional help”. Kelly said: “My theory on why [Trump] likes the dictators so much is that’s who he is. “Every incoming president is shocked that they actually have so little power without going to the Congress, which is a good thing. It’s civics 101, separation of powers, three equal branches of government. “But in his case, he was shocked that he didn’t have dictatorial-type powers to send US forces places or to move money around within the budget. And he looked at Putin and Xi [Jinping, of China] and that nutcase in North Korea as people who were like him in terms of being a tough guy.” On Tuesday, the Biden campaign responded to Kelly’s remarks. A spokesperson, Sarafina Chitika, said: “Donald Trump’s praise for Hitler is disgraceful but wholly unsurprising from the man who has parroted Nazi rhetoric on the campaign trail, called his political opponents ‘vermin’, and sucked up to dictators and authoritarians like Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orbán, Kim Jong-un, and the rest of the gang. “When Donald Trump talks like a dictator, praises dictators, and says he wants to be a dictator, we should probably believe him.”",2024-03-12 14:42:53,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/12/mussolini-trump-hitler-john-kelly-jim-sciutto-book,The Guardian,720,second white house chief staff tried stop praising part trying convince president fascist dictator great guy comparison said well good retired marine general kelly told interview new book said well said well rebuilt economy rebuilt economy turned people world said sir never say anything good guy nothing mean great guy comparison kelly retired u marine corp general homeland security secretary trump administration becoming second chief staff end 2018 eventually public opponent former bos anchor national security analyst new book return great preview kelly told pretty hard believe trump holocaust assessment pretty hard understand 400000 second world war think … tough guy thing liking authoritarian particular russia well known kelly like former practice keeping book bed conversation kelly come amid resurgent authoritarian trump presumptive republican presidential nominee despite facing 91 criminal civil seen disqualify office shortly trump home leader singing said trump joe u would give penny aid fight kelly told trump thought guy kim guy … like didnt wouldnt trump recently said encourage russia attack trump pay enough alliance condemning dumb shameful sought portray trump threat world security well u democracy kelly told point trump saw absolutely point also dead set south korea deterrent force japan deterrent force north korea kelly general fill civil role administration also marine first secretary defense army second national security adviser kelly told trump thought u would prove loyal german would ask loyalty kelly said pointed german group loyal fact tried assassinate time didnt know truly brought u would loyal would anything u trump told kelly seek professional help kelly said theory trump much thats every incoming president actually little power without going congress good thing civics 101 separation three equal government case didnt send u move money around within budget xi china north korea people like tough guy campaign said praise disgraceful wholly unsurprising man rhetoric campaign trail political vermin like kim rest gang trump like dictator dictator probably believe aide tried stop trump praising telling great guy
FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,721,The global outlook is perilous. But here are three things Labour can do to make the world a safer place | Simon Tisdall,"An incoming Labour government will face a daunting array of foreign and defence policy challenges, many of which are beyond the ability of any one country to resolve. Willingness to engage in multilateral, cooperative approaches to common problems – and unstinting support for the UN charter – must be guiding principles. Immediate challenges include the foreign and domestic ramifications of the wars in Ukraine and Palestine, and the prospect of a new rightwing US administration. If a re-elected Donald Trump broke with Europe and Nato and dissolved the “special relationship”, Britain could be dangerously isolated, considering it is already divorced from Europe. Longer-term challenges include vexed efforts to tackle the climate crisis, food insecurity, mass migration and political instability; poverty, protectionism, and debt relief; the rise of China and similar authoritarian, anti-democratic regimes; the deteriorating global security situation; disrespect for international law and human rights; and AI and cyberterrorism. Here are three priority policy areas where a Labour government could demonstrate global leadership and make a positive difference. The proliferation of nuclear weapons poses an existential threat to humankind and is accelerating around the world. There are nine nuclear weapon states, ranked by total number of warheads: Russia, the US, China, France, the UK, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea. In addition, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Belarus “host” nuclear bombs. Other countries, for example Iran, Saudi Arabia and Japan, either have, or might quickly acquire, the ability to build nuclear weapons. Most nuclear weapon states are expanding or updating their arsenals. The development of smaller, low-yield “battlefield” nukes and drone delivery systems is raising the risk of nuclear warfare. Labour should set an example by drastically lowering the total number of UK nuclear warheads in line with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It should announce its intention to phase out Britain’s unaffordable, US-supervised Trident at-sea ballistic missile deterrent. The UK should join other Nato countries in developing a common European defensive nuclear shield while prioritising global disarmament. Labour should launch a drive to maximise Britain’s ability to influence world affairs and international public opinion through the imaginative use of non-military soft power tools – a more effective form of defence than building sitting-duck aircraft carriers or firing off missiles at Houthis at America’s behest. It should immediately reverse the cuts to the overseas aid and development budget imposed by Boris Johnson’s government in 2020 and restore the target spend to at least 0.7% of gross national income. Foreign aid saves and builds lives. It is an invaluable means of promoting British values and democratic standards. Labour should make it easier for foreign nationals to study at British universities. Funding for the British Council’s worldwide work in education, cultural outreach and English language teaching should rise. Likewise, the BBC World Service should be cherished – and adequately resourced. BBC Arabic and BBC Persian are closing down. That’s plain crazy. The 2020 merger of the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development was a destructive act that should be unpicked. UK diplomacy has suffered damaging cutbacks and appalling leadership in recent years. Labour should recruit a new generation of diplomats with an ambitious brief to boost UK interests and leverage, build international coalitions, and assist in conflict resolution. Membership of the EU maximised Britain’s soft power through close association with 27 mostly likeminded countries. Labour must be candid about the huge damage done by Brexit, do everything possible to repair and strengthen UK-EU ties, and bury silly Tory ideas about Global Britain’s “tilt to Asia”. Unlike the US, Britain maintains full diplomatic relations with Iran and can draw on long-established institutional knowledge of the country. Labour should use this traditional engagement to restart the dialogue with Iran’s leadership that was fatally undermined by Trump. Improved western relations with Tehran, arguably the leading regional power, are the key to a safer, less volatile Middle East – and to reducing Islamophobic and antisemitic spillovers in Britain. Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen are all countries where Iran wields significant influence. Less confrontational policies and careful diplomacy could deliver more productive relationships. Resuming talks on limiting Iran’s nuclear arms-related capabilities in return for lifting sanctions would be a confidence-building start. Yet Labour’s larger aim should be to enlist Iran’s help in resolving the Israel-Gaza conflict and turning dreams of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state into reality. A Labour government should immediately offer diplomatic recognition to the state of Palestine while pushing for meaningful democratic reform of the Palestinian Authority. It should increase UK financial support, including resumed funding of the UN’s aid agency in Gaza. Labour must tell Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, if it is still in office, that bilateral relations will suffer serious consequences if Israel continues to try to veto the two-state solution the world wants.

FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,722,Aged care report released – as it happened,"Thank you for joining us on the live blog today – hear is a wrap of the main news: Police hold “serious concerns” for seven people – including four children – who are missing in Western Australia, which has recorded heavy rainfall and flooding. Older farmers are leading an attack on practices used by the major supermarkets that they say are sending the fruit and vegetable industry broke. Labor’s longest serving foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has urged the Australian government to “get off the fence” and immediately reinstate funding to a key UN agency to help avert mass starvation in Gaza. Older Australians with more wealth should have to pay more for the cost of their aged care, a government-appointed expert panel has recommended, potentially from their superannuation balances. Western Australia will receive $6.2bn more GST this year as a result of a Turnbull-government era deal backed by Labor, triggering $5.2bn in payments to other states to ensure they are no worse off. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi will be able to use statements from X users on how a tweet by Pauline Hanson made them feel, as well as examples of alleged racially charged statements from Hanson’s 30-year political career, in her racial vilification case against the One Nation leader. A man has been charged with murder after being accused of a fatal stabbing in a Gold Coast shopping centre car park. Thanks for sticking with us today. We’ll be back with you, bright and early, tomorrow. Western Australia police have provided an update on the seven people – including four children – who have been missing since Sunday. According to police, two vehicles left Kalgoorlie Boulder on Sunday between 10am and 2pm. Officers believe the group were returning to the remote community, Tjuntjuntjarra, 650km north-east of Kalgoorlie. The force’s Mick Kelly said police believe the seven people are family members and members of the Tjuntjuntjarra community: Concerns are held due to the fact that we’ve had severe weather and rain and more has been forecasted over the next 24 hours. We are unsure of what food and water resources they have on board. These are local members of the community of Tjuntjuntjarra and we are actively trying to communicate these people. Kelly said efforts to find the group have been affected by the weather conditions. The group were travelling on an unsealed track. A helicopter search for the group was abandoned earlier today due to poor visibility. Western Australia police has serious concerns for seven people – including four children – who are missing in a remote and flood-affected region of the state. According to police, two vehicles left Kalgoorlie Boulder on Sunday between 10am and 2pm. Officers believe they were travelling to Tjuntjuntjarra, 650km north-east of Kalgoorlie. Here’s the statement from police: The first vehicle is a beige coloured Toyota Landcruiser registration number ‘A683’, which is believed to contain an elderly driver. The second vehicle is a white Mitsubishi Triton registration number ‘KBC8881’, which is believed to contain an elderly driver and five other occupants of which four are children aged between 7-17 years. Concerns are held for the occupants of these two vehicles due to serious weather conditions. It is unknown how much food and water the occupants have in their possession. As my colleague Mostafa Rachwani pointed out a few moments ago, the state has experienced heavy rain and flooding in recent days. Land routes into WA remain cut off due to rain Heavy rain and flooding has cut off road and rail links into Western Australia. The Eyre Highway has been closed since the weekend and is likely to remain out of operation for several days. The Trans-Australian Railway line has also been affected, with key freight routes running between WA and South Australia through the Nullarbor closed amid the rain. Parts of WA experienced more than half a year’s rain in 24 hours over the weekend, with more than 155mm of rain recorded at Rawlinna, 900km east of Perth, since 9am Friday. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast totals of up to 130mm for parts of the Goldfields, Eucla and south interior districts on Tuesday. Christmas Island is being battered with heavy rain and strong winds, and could be facing a tropical cyclone in coming days. Will Parker from WeXplore Travel sent this video to Guardian Australia, showing some of the weather chaos. Matildas sell out again Australia’s love for the Matildas shows no signs of abating, with their next home game against China in May selling out in a matter of hours. The match against the world No 19 team is one of two farewell friendlies the Matildas will play before kicking off their Olympic campaign in Paris. The fixture at the 53,500-capacity Adelaide Oval will mark the 13th consecutive sellout crowd for the team and one million fans through the gates since 2017. 1️⃣,0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣,0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ fans through the gates!South Australia’s iconic Adelaide Oval is on the brink of making history as it prepares to welcome the one-millionth person to watch us play at home since 2017! 🇦🇺 v 🇨🇳 31.05.24 - @TheAdelaideOval#Matildas #TilitsDone The Football Australia (FA) boss, James Johnson, said the unprecedented demand was “a testament to the growing popularity and support for football in Australia”. We are confident that the upcoming matches for both the CommBank Matildas and the Subway Socceroos will continue to draw full stadiums, reaffirming the strong connection between our teams and their supporters. FA said a limited number of tickets for the Adelaide game may be released closer to the date, while tickets for the second friendly against China in Sydney on 3 June go on sale from this Friday. Tasmanian Labor leader reiterates support for AFL team Tasmanian Labor leader, Rebecca White, has sought to make it clear the state’s proposed AFL team would not be at risk if she is elected later this month. The proposed AFL stadium at Macquarie Point has been a controversial issue in Tasmania, with the issue featuring in debate ahead of the election on 23 March. Here’s what White told the ABC a few moments ago: The team is not in jeopardy under a Labor government. I grew up around regional football. It has been a part of my life forever and I support us getting our own team. We have been very clear that what we want to do is sit down with the AFL and make sure we have a great deal for Tassie, which hasn’t been delivered so far. I take on face value the fact they will work with us, if we are elected to government. There is no risk to the Tasmanian team. Bob Katter clashes with fellow MP Ross Cadell over supermarket inquiry The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, says Ross Cadell should not be removed from a Senate inquiry into supermarket pricing. Independent MP Bob Katter has demanded Cadell be replaced on the committee after the pair clashed at a press conference earlier today. You can see a bit of that clash in this video: Mad as a Katter - Bob sees red in Orange pic.twitter.com/9ebKu13Wgf Littleproud has defended Cadell’s conduct, while also attacking Katter’s. Late last month, Katter and fellow independent MP Andrew Wilkie dressed up in pig suits at Parliament House to protest against the supermarkets. Here’s what Littleproud told the ABC: What Ross Cadell showed today was the frustration of many producers, particularly in Orange. Producers that have been done over by Coles and Woolworths. They are wanting a voice. But don’t want stunts. They want adults in the room. Not people dressed up in pig suits trying to bring attention in an undignified way. This is a serious topic. WA rail link remains closed after record rains The only rail line connecting Western Australia to the rest of the country is likely to remain closed for several days as parts of the state experience more than half a year’s worth of rain in 24 hours. The Trans-Australian Railway line, a key freight route running between WA and South Australia through the Nullarbor, has been closed since Sunday with floodwaters inundating parts of the track. The Eyre Highway – the main road connecting WA with SA – was also closed due to flooding, but re-opened on Tuesday morning. National weather update for this week: Temps to drop on the south-east coast from Tuesday but will stay high inland. More rain for interior & southern #WA, Severe Weather Warning in place. Potential tropical #cyclone developing north-west of WA. Latest: https://t.co/jlOoTZL1iF pic.twitter.com/2hoVABMIR8 More than 155mm of rain has fallen on Rawlinna, 900km east of Perth, since 9am on Friday, while the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast 24-hour totals of up to 130mm for parts of the Goldfields, Eucla and south interior districts. Average rainfall in those areas is about 260mm a year. Local share market stabilises The local share market has closed marginally higher, stabilising after Monday’s 1.8% plunge, as traders await another inflation readout from the US that could determine the path of interest rate cuts. AAP reports the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index on Tuesday finished up 8.3 points, or 0.11%, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 9.4 points, or 0.12%. The Australian dollar was buying 66.18 US cents, from 66.15 US cents at Monday’s ASX close. Minister admits people in Gaza ‘clearly need help ‘ Cabinet minister Murray Watt has been asked what would need to happen before the Australian government restores $6m in emergency funding for UNRWA. Australia was among more than a dozen donor countries to suspend funding to the agency in late January, after the Israeli government alleged that 12 UNRWA staff members were involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Here’s what Watt told ABC a few moments ago: I think there is widespread recognition not just within the government, but right around the world, that we do need to see more aid delivered into Gaza at the moment. The conditions that people are living in our horrible and they clearly need help. The issues with UNRWA have been widely ventilated and it is appropriate that an investigation is undertaken. But I know that [foreign minister] Penny Wong is working incredibly hard to have this situation resolved and to explore the best way to get aid in where it is most desperately needed.",2024-03-12

TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,723,South Korea doctors’ strike: government moves to suspend thousands of medical licences,"South Korea’s government has started taking steps to suspend the medical licences of thousands of striking doctors, as concern grows that the month-long dispute is affecting frontline health care services. The walkout by almost 12,000 doctors from 100 teaching hospitals has led to surgery cancellations, longer waiting times and delays in treatment, including for patients seeking emergency care, according to media reports. The health ministry said it had put in motion procedures that could see 4,900 of the striking doctors lose their licences if they continue to defy orders to return to work. The ministry also said it had sent administrative notifications, following up on warnings that strikers faced a three-month suspension – a punishment that could delay their ability to qualify as specialists for at least a year. The increasingly acrimonious dispute began as a protest against government plans to dramatically raise the number of trainee doctors to address shortages in rural areas and greater demand on services caused by South Korea’s rapidly ageing population. But the 11,994 striking doctors, who make up 93% of the trainee workforce, claim the recruitment of 2,000 additional students a year from 2025 will compromise the quality of services. Instead, they have called for improvements to pay and conditions. This week the health ministry said it would assign 20 military surgeons and 138 public health doctors to boost staff numbers at selected hospitals, but denied that the country’s health services had descended into chaos. Chun Byung-wang, director of the ministry’s health and medical policy division, suggested that doctors who return will avoid punishment. “The government will take into account the circumstance and protect trainee doctors if they return to work before the administrative measure is complete,” Chun said. He added: “The government will not give up on dialogue. The door is always open. The government will respect and listen to opinions of the medical community as a companion for the medical reforms.” In an attempt to resolve the dispute, the government last week announced measures to improve pay and conditions for trainee medics, as well as a review of continuous 36-hour shifts – a key grievance among junior medics. But the concessions have failed to placate doctors. Demands are growing for the two sides to negotiate. “Doctors and the government are not in a boxing ring,” the Kyunghyang Shinmun newspaper said in an editorial. “People’s patience is wearing thin … the exit from this quagmire must be found through dialogue between the two sides.” Critics of the recruitment plan have accused the country’s conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, of using the medical reforms to boost his People Power party’s prospects at next month’s national assembly elections. A poll published last week by the Yonhap news agency found 84% of respondents supported hiring more doctors, and 43% said striking physicians should receive severe punishments.",2024-03-12 05:06:24,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/12/south-korea-doctor-strike-government-suspends-medical-licenses,The Guardian,723,south government taking suspend medical striking concern dispute affecting health care walkout almost 12000 100 teaching led surgery longer waiting time treatment seeking emergency care according medium health ministry said put motion could see 4900 striking lose continue defy return work ministry also said sent administrative following faced suspension punishment could delay ability qualify least year increasingly acrimonious dispute protest government dramatically raise number trainee address rural greater demand south rapidly population 11994 striking make 93 trainee claim recruitment 2000 additional year 2025 compromise quality instead pay week health ministry said would assign 20 military 138 public health boost staff selected health chaos chun director health medical policy division return avoid punishment government take account circumstance protect trainee return work administrative measure complete chun said added government give dialogue door always open government respect listen medical community companion medical attempt resolve dispute government last week improve pay trainee well review continuous 36hour key grievance among junior placate growing two side negotiate government boxing ring newspaper said editorial patience wearing thin … exit quagmire must found dialogue two side recruitment plan accused conservative president medical boost people power next national assembly poll last week news agency found 84 43 said striking receive severe south korea strike government suspend medical
