He called it “a tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people.” The workers were traveling in clearly marked vehicles, and World Central Kitchen said it had coordinated its movements with Israel’s military.

It is the network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East dedicated to reducing U.S. influence in the region and ultimately eliminating the state of Israel. The network’s name is a play on former President George W. Bush’s 2002 claim that Iran, Iraq and North Korea made up an Axis of Evil. The Axis of Resistance includes Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and other groups, and both its strategy and its tactics have long been radical. The official slogan of the Houthis — the Yemen-based group that has attacked commercial ships in the Red Sea — includes “death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews,” for example.

"Biden and Japan’s Leader Look to Bind Ties to Outlast Them Both","When President Biden welcomes Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to Washington this week for a visit highlighted by the pomp of a state dinner, there will be an inescapable subtext to all the ceremony: Both leaders are in a fight to keep their jobs. With Mr. Biden facing a tight re-election contest with his predecessor and Mr. Kishida’s approval ratings falling to record lows amid a political scandal, the leaders are expected to discuss ways to entrench their countries’ alliance so it remains strong even if they are no longer around to nurture it. The goal is to “create a situation where no one can unbind their ties,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor of international relations at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.

The topics raised by Mr. Biden included fighting narcotics production, the Middle East conflict, North Korea’s nuclear program and China’s support of Russia during the Ukraine war, according to a White House summary of the call. Mr. Biden intended the talk to be a “check-in” rather than a discussion with concrete outcomes, said a senior administration official, who spoke to a small group of reporters on Monday night on the condition of anonymity, as is customary for such Washington briefings. But it was a crucial marker during a pivotal political year and as the countries try to steady a relationship that hit a multi-decade low last year.

"Tesla’s Sales Drop, a Sign That Its Grip on the E.V. Market Is Slipping","Tesla appeared to be losing command of the market it effectively created after it reported a stunning drop in quarterly sales on Tuesday, raising fresh questions about Elon Musk’s leadership of the company. The sales decline caught investors off guard as rivals like BYD of China and Kia and Hyundai of South Korea reported increases in electric vehicle sales, suggesting that slower overall demand for battery-powered models was not the only explanation for Tesla’s problems. Tesla pioneered the market for electric vehicles with its Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, which proved that battery-powered cars could be appealing, practical and profitable. The cars revolutionized the auto industry and forced established carmakers to develop their own electric models. But the market is evolving in ways that may not favor Tesla. In contrast to the early adopters who fueled Tesla’s rise, mainstream buyers may be put off by the vehicles’ unconventional design, including minimalist interiors and lack of buttons and switches. Almost all functions in Tesla vehicles are controlled from a large screen on the dashboard. The system “makes it thoroughly distracting to adjust almost anything within the vehicle while motoring down the road,” Consumer Reports wrote in a review on Tuesday of a new version of the Model 3. Tesla, which sells cars online and does not have many showrooms, is often the target of complaints about poor service. That may provide an advantage to established carmakers, like Ford Motor and General Motors, that have extensive dealer networks and are ramping up production of electric vehicles. Tesla seems at a loss to respond to those challenges. It has been slow to follow up its initial success with new models, and Mr. Musk appears disengaged. He did not react Tuesday to the sales figures on X, the social media platform that he owns and posts on prolifically. Instead, he threw barbs at Walt Disney Company executives whom he accuses of being “woke.” Such remarks have made him a hero to conservatives but may be pushing liberals, who are more likely to buy electric cars, away from Tesla. Tesla said it delivered 387,000 cars worldwide in the first quarter, down 8.5 percent from 423,000 in the same period last year. This was the first time Tesla’s quarterly sales have fallen on a year over year basis since a modest drop at the start of the pandemic in 2020. The sales figures were also significantly lower than the estimates of Wall Street analysts who had expected a modest increase. “Tesla can’t stand still,” Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, said in an email. “Chinese E.V.s are already gaining a foothold in Europe, and it is unclear how long they will be forbidden from entering the U.S.” More affordable cars would help Tesla appeal to a broader spectrum of buyers, Mr. Rose said. To be sure, some of the sales decline may have reflected production problems beyond the company’s control, including a fire at a Tesla factory near Berlin that was the result of an arson attack. And the company’s cars still have many fans. While panning the Model 3’s controls, Consumer Reports said the latest version provided a better ride than its predecessor and had improved handling. But investors are clearly alarmed. Tesla’s shares have fallen more than 30 percent this year — including a 5 percent drop on Tuesday — because of concern that the company has lost momentum. In China, Tesla faces BYD and dozens of other rivals with ambitions to expand worldwide. In Europe, established carmakers like Volkswagen and BMW have introduced more compelling battery-powered models. And in the United States, sales of electric cars are not growing as fast as they were a year ago, and many buyers are opting instead for hybrid models that pair a gasoline engine with batteries and electric motors. Our business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover. Tesla rivals have continued to report sales increases. BYD said on Tuesday that it sold about 300,000 electric vehicles, up 13 percent from a year earlier. The company also sold 324,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles in the first quarter, up 15 percent. BYD and other Chinese automakers have introduced new models rapidly, often undercutting Tesla on price. Those companies are also increasingly exporting cars to Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America. Kia, based in South Korea, said Tuesday that its sales of electric vehicles in the United States more than doubled in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier after it introduced a new large sport utility vehicle, the EV9. Kia’s sister company, Hyundai, said it sold more than 10,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter in the United States, up 75 percent. Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, doesn’t sell many fully electric vehicles. But the company said U.S. sales of electrified vehicles, a category largely made up of hybrids, under the Toyota and Lexus brands was up 74 percent in the first quarter. Tesla pioneered mass-market electric cars, but its lineup is aging. The company’s only new model since 2020 is the Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that went on sale in limited numbers last year. The least expensive version that Tesla says it can deliver this year starts at around $80,000, which makes it unaffordable to most car buyers. Rivian, whose R1 pickup competes with the Cybertruck, said its sales, including of the truck and its two other models, rose 70 percent in the quarter, to 13,600 vehicles. Tesla is working on an electric car that would cost around $25,000, but the model is not expected to go on sale in large numbers until 2026. In the meantime, Tesla remains dependent on the Model Y and the Model 3 for most of its sales. The company has repeatedly cut prices, but analysts say the strategy has lowered its profits without doing enough to stimulate sales. The company has recently modestly raised the prices of some cars in the United States and China. The Model Y starts at nearly $45,000 before federal and state tax breaks, after an increase of $1,000 announced this week. The quarterly sales figure shows Tesla managers “they need a real sales strategy and can’t rely on cutting price alone,” Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm, posted on X. Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, has not given a clear indication of how the company plans to regain momentum. At the same time, his polarizing statements and endorsement of right-wing conspiracy theories have alienated many of the left-leaning customers who are most likely to buy electric cars. Raphaelle Cassens, a Los Angeles resident, gave up her leased Tesla Model Y last year and replaced it with a leased electric BMW i4. Mr. Musk was one reason she switched, she said. “Honestly, I don’t like him as an individual at all,” said Ms. Cassens, who is a registered Democrat but described herself as nonpartisan. She also said she received poor service from the company. “The attitude from the company definitely reflects the owner,” Ms. Cassens added. At least one other large automaker is also struggling with electric vehicle sales. G.M. reported on Tuesday that its U.S. sales for the first quarter fell 1.5 percent, in large part because deliveries of battery-powered cars were down by about a fifth to around 16,000 vehicles. The drop in battery-powered vehicle sales was the result of a sharp decline in sales of the Chevrolet Bolt, which G.M. stopped making at the end of 2023. Sales of other electric models that use G.M.’s newest battery technology rose but not enough to make up for the loss of the Bolt, which was one of the most affordable electric cars in the United States.","2024-04-02 13:16:44","https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/business/tesla-auto-sales-first-quarter.html","New York Times"
"‘Sugar’ Review: In a Lonely Place With Colin Farrell","This much I can tell you: Colin Farrell plays a private detective in “Sugar.” He has a license. We see it being handed to him and everything. I can also tell you that his character, John Sugar, is not an ordinary private detective, in ways that go beyond his fetishization of the film noir heroes he emulates. But I can’t really get into it because “Sugar” — which premieres Friday on Apple TV+ with two of its eight episodes — is a show with a congenital vulnerability to spoilers. The show is the first television project of Mark Protosevich, whose short list of screenplays across more than two decades includes “I Am Legend” and Spike Lee’s remake of the South Korean revenge drama “Oldboy.” Based on “Sugar,” it is fair to guess that he shares his protagonist’s obsession with noir.

"Lou Conter, Last Survivor of the Battleship Arizona, Dies at 102","Lou Conter, the last known survivor of the battleship Arizona, which sank with the loss of 1,177 sailors and Marines in Japan’s sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, plunging the United States into World War II, died on Monday at his home in Grass Valley, Calif. He was 102. The death was confirmed by Warren R. Hull, a co-writer (with his wife, Annette Hull) of Mr. Conter’s 2021 memoir, “The Lou Conter Story: From U.S.S. Arizona Survivor to Unsung American Hero."" Mr. Conter, who held the rank of quartermaster, a position assisting in the Arizona’s navigation, was on his shift shortly after 8 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, when a Japanese armor-piercing bomb penetrated five steel decks and blew up more than one million pounds of gunpowder and thousands of rounds of ammunition stored in its hull as the ship was moored in the harbor, in Honolulu, Hawaii. “The ship was consumed in a giant fireball,” he wrote in his memoir. Mr. Conter, who was knocked forward but uninjured, tended to survivors, many of them blinded and badly burned. When the order to abandon ship came, he was knee deep in water. A lifeboat took him ashore, and in the days that followed he helped in recovering bodies and putting out fires. Only 93 of those who were aboard the ship at the time lived; 242 other crew members were ashore. Advertisement Mr. Conter later attended Navy flight school and flew 200 combat missions in the Pacific, some of them involving nighttime dive bombing of Japanese targets. During one three-night period, his crew rescued 219 Australian coast watchers from New Guinea who were in danger of being overrun by approaching Japanese. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for that exploit. How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here. Holding the rank of lieutenant, Mr. Conter went on to fly 29 combat missions during the Korean War and serve as an intelligence officer for a Navy aircraft carrier group. In the late 1950s, he helped establish the Navy’s first SERE program (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) to train Navy airmen in how to survive if they were shot down in the jungle and captured. He retired from the Navy in 1967 as a lieutenant commander and was later a real estate broker and developer in the Los Angeles area. Louis Anthony Conter was born on Sept. 13, 1921, in the northern Wisconsin town of Ojibwa, a son of Nicholas and Lottie Conter. His father was involved in construction work that eventually took the family to Wheatridge, Colo., outside Denver. After graduating from high school, Lou joined the Navy in 1939 and reported to the Arizona in January 1940. Advertisement His wife, Valerie, died in 2016. His two previous marriages ended in divorce. He had three children from his first marriage and another three from his second, along with many grandchildren. Complete information about his survivors was not immediately available.  His death came almost a year after that of Ken Potts, the second-to-last survivor of the attack, who was also 102. Mr. Conter’s home in Grass Valley, in Northern California near Tahoe National Forest, was filled with memorabilia from the Arizona, including a piece of the wreckage. He once said that “each morning I wake up, pay homage” to all the Americans killed on Pearl Harbor Sunday, “including the 1,177 of my shipmates on the Arizona, and go from there.” He rejected any notion that the dwindling number of Arizona survivors should be hailed as heroes. “The 2,403 men that died are the heroes,” he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press, referring to all the Americans who perished in the Pearl Harbor attack. “I’m not a hero. I was just doing my job.” Advertisement Until 2020, when the infirmities of age limited him, Mr. Conter attended annual memorial services at Pearl Harbor organized by the Navy and the National Park Service. The U.S.S. Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, which is overseen by the park service, marks the resting place of 1,102 of the crewmen killed in the attack on what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called “a date which will live in infamy” when he asked Congress for a declaration of war with Japan. The memorial, built in 1962 and visited by nearly two million people annually, straddles the sunken hull of the Arizona without touching it. It reads: “To the memory of the gallant men here entombed and their shipmates who gave their lives in action on December 7, 1941, on the U.S.S. Arizona.” The battleship’s sunken remains are a National Historic Landmark.

The move raised questions about its plans as the war reached the six-month mark — Israeli media reported that the withdrawal meant there were no Israeli troops actively maneuvering in southern Gaza. It was unclear what the latest drawdown of forces meant for the prospect of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city.

"NATO Weighs Taking Over U.S.-Led Group Directing Ukraine Military Aid","With continued American aid to Ukraine stalled and the looming prospect of a second Trump presidency, NATO’s top diplomat said on Wednesday that the alliance was poised to take more control over military support sent to Ukraine — a role that the United States has played for the past two years. Details are still being worked out, but Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed to pursue plans to give the military alliance more oversight in coordinating security assistance and training for Ukraine.  Should the plan comes to fruition, it would represent a shift from NATO’s previous reluctance to be pulled more directly into the conflict and risk a severe military response from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. And it is not certain that NATO’s most powerful member, the United States, ultimately will agree to a measure that could dilute its influence.

"Monday Briefing","The Israeli military said that it had withdrawn a division of ground troops from the southern Gaza Strip. The drawdown, from the southern city of Khan Younis, means that no Israeli troops are currently maneuvering in southern Gaza, the Israeli news media reported. It was unclear what the withdrawal might signal for Israel’s oft-stated plan to invade the southernmost city of Rafah. Israel has significantly reduced the number of troops on the ground in Gaza over the past several months. But officials made clear that the army would stay in other parts of Gaza to preserve its “freedom of action and its ability to conduct precise intelligence-based operations.” And Israel’s defense minister said the military was preparing for “follow-up missions” that included Rafah. News of the withdrawal came as international mediators gathered in Cairo in hopes of brokering a temporary cease-fire, six months into a war that is now the longest involving Israel since the 1980s.

Glas had been living at the embassy since December and was granted political asylum by Mexico hours before he was arrested.

"Help Ukraine Hold the Line","After more than two years of brutal, unrelenting war, Ukraine is still ready and has the capacity to defend its democracy and territory against Russia. But it cannot do so without American military assistance, which the United States had assured the Ukrainians would be there as long as it was needed. A majority of Americans understand this, and believe that curbing the revanchist dreams of Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, is America’s duty to Ukraine and to American security. A survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Ipsos found that 58 percent of Americans favor providing economic help to Ukraine and sending more arms and military equipment to the Ukrainian government. And 60 percent of respondents said that the U.S. security relationship with Ukraine does more to strengthen American national security than to weaken it. While that support has declined somewhat since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, and it is weaker among Republicans, many Republican members of Congress also support continuing military aid. So it is distressing that the fate of Ukraine has fallen prey to internecine Republican politicking. House Speaker Mike Johnson has the power to do the right thing, but time is running critically short. Without American artillery, as well as antitank and antiaircraft shells and missiles, Ukraine cannot hold off an army that has a far deeper supply of men and munitions. “Russia is now firing at least five times as many artillery rounds as Ukraine,” as Andrew Kramer of The Times reported. As summer approaches, Russia is expected to prepare a new offensive thrust. Mr. Johnson knows this. He also knows that, if he brings it to a vote, a $60.1 billion aid package for Ukraine would most likely sail through the House with bipartisan support. Many Republican members and most Democrats want to pass it. The Senate passed it in February. Yet so far, Mr. Johnson has avoided a vote, fearing that a clutch of far-right House members, who parrot the views of Donald Trump and oppose any more aid for Ukraine, could topple him from the speaker’s post. To placate them, the speaker has said he will produce a proposal with “important innovations” when legislators return to work on Tuesday. These may include lifting the Biden administration’s hold on liquefied natural gas exports, including a proposed terminal in his home state, Louisiana; calling the aid a loan; or seizing billions of frozen Russian assets. None of those conditions are wise. Tying aid for Ukraine to unrelated political goals, such as undoing President Biden’s climate change agenda, may be typical of congressional horse trading, but it turns Ukraine into a pawn in partisan conflict. “This is not some political skirmish that only matters here in America,” Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, said on his visit to Washington last month. The speaker’s decision, he said, “will really cost thousands of lives there — children, women. He must be aware of his personal responsibility.” Nor does it make sense to force Ukraine to take on massive debt when it’s fighting for its life, and its economy is already dependent on aid. Seizing large sums of money from another sovereign nation could also have unpredictable legal and economic consequences. Given Ukraine’s perilous position, however, most Democrats and Republicans would likely accept what Mr. Johnson cobbles together, even measures they have reservations about, particularly since the package also includes aid for Israel and Taiwan. Those lawmakers are right to pursue a reasonable compromise. The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has also suggested that Democrats will support Mr. Johnson as speaker to avoid yet another damaging and pointless fight over the speakership. Those moves are welcome steps to try to loosen the grip of Republican extremists on America’s ability to support its allies. Of course, recalcitrance in Congress is not Ukraine’s only problem. Europe has been slow to step in to meet Ukraine’s military needs, and the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, may have taken too long to lower the recruitment age to 25 in the face of a shortage of soldiers. But American weapons and artillery are essential to Ukraine’s ability to hold the line and, eventually, to negotiate for an end to hostilities from a position of strength. No country has the stockpiles or the production capabilities to match the United States in producing and providing the 155-millimeter artillery shells, HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) or air defense systems that Ukraine requires to hold the Russians at bay. Russia, by contrast, has successfully ramped up military production and is receiving supplies from North Korea and Iran, and Mr. Putin has used the recent terror attack on a concert hall in Moscow to ramp up recruitment. Ukraine is already suffering the consequences of America’s faltering support. Russian forces took the eastern city of Avdiivka in February, and U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that this happened because Ukraine ran out of artillery shells. The Russian command is doubtlessly aware of this as it plans its next moves. Mr. Putin gambled from the outset that the United States would not go the distance in its support for Ukraine, and he must be reveling in the goings-on in Congress. Allowing Russia to impose its will on Ukraine would be a devastating blow to America’s credibility and leadership — fulfilling one of Mr. Putin’s long-term goals. That, in turn, would risk encouraging him to test waters further afield, whether in the Baltic States, in western Europe or to the south, and would signal to Xi Jinping that China, too, can throw its weight around. Mr. Trump and his followers may argue that the security of Ukraine, or even of Europe, is not America’s business. But the consequence of allowing a Russian victory in Ukraine is a world in which authoritarian strongmen feel free to crush dissent or seize territory with impunity. That is a threat to the security of America, and the world. Congress is prepared to stand up to this aggression; it is Mr. Johnson’s duty to bring this effort to a vote.

"Biden Threatens to Condition Israel Aid","During a tense 30-minute call today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Biden threatened to condition future American support for Israel on whether it improves its treatment of civilians in Gaza. Biden called the humanitarian situation in the enclave “unacceptable,” and insisted to Netanyahu that he quickly put in place specific protections. It was the first time that the president has sought to leverage American aid to influence the conduct of Israel’s war against Hamas, a step some of his closest allies have publicly supported. Biden’s frustration with Netanyahu has grown in recent months. But in public, he has staunchly supported Israel’s right to respond to Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. During the call, Biden urged Netanyahu to negotiate a deal that would result in an “immediate cease-fire” and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. A spokesman said the White House expects Israel to make announcements of specific changes within hours or days.

"Lou Whittaker, Mountain Adventurer and Entrepreneur, Dies at 95","Lou Whittaker, a patriarch of the nation’s foremost mountaineering family, who helped to make climbing broadly accessible by building a trusted guide company and creating a tourism industry on Mount Rainier, died on March 24 in Ashford, Wash., a town at the base of that mountain. He was 95. The cause was congestive heart failure, his son Peter said. In spite of his many accomplishments in the business, culture and sport of mountaineering, Lou was not the best-known Whittaker. That distinction belongs to Jim, Lou’s identical twin brother, who was the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest, in 1963, and the longtime chief executive of the outdoor gear company REI. Jim is something of an alpine John Glenn — the doer of a feat of will and skill considered transcendent in the 1960s, a friend of the Kennedy family and the subject of action-shot portraits on the cover of Life magazine. Lou’s sons, too, have become prominent climbers: Rainier Mountaineering Inc. (RMI), the guiding company that Lou co-founded, is now run by Peter and employs his brother, Win, as a veteran guide. Advertisement The originals of the Whittaker line shared not only a height of 6-foot-5 and a shoe size of 13 but also impeccable timing. Lou and Jim rose to prominence and success right as the nation took an interest in mountaineering as a death-defying sport for pros and a pastime for tourists and rich adventurers. After being confused for each other even by acquaintances into their 30s, the twins led increasingly independent lives. Jim grew to be the reserved hero of a past era: Four decades after reaching Everest’s summit, he described the experience as “the high point of my life” to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Lou, conversely, was the toast of the town: an institution-building entrepreneur and voluble drinking buddy known for wearing loud turtlenecks, cracking ribald jokes and eating like a barn animal. The story of their shared passion began in 1939, when two 10-year-olds with asthma discovered that they could breathe freely in the high mountains. Louis Winslow Whittaker was born 10 minutes after Jim on Feb. 10, 1929, in Seattle, where they grew up. Their father, Charles, sold and installed burglar alarms, and their mother, Hortense (Gant) Whittaker, raised them and their older brother, Barney. Lou and Jim started climbing when they accompanied Barney on a Boy Scout trip. They soon joined a troop themselves with an inspiring scoutmaster, Tom Campbell, who had lost much of his arm early in World War II and climbed by unscrewing a wooden hand, revealing a hook, then hooking up rock faces. Advertisement By 18, the boys had conquered most of Washington’s major peaks, though much of their mountaineering came on rescue missions. They learned lessons from tragic mistakes: After one climber, who stepped on his poncho on a ledge, slipped and fell to his death, they never wore loose clothing at elevation. They also gained stories with which they would regale listeners for decades to come. Twice while climbing the highest mountain in North America, Denali, in Alaska, they heaved an injured climber into a two-seater helicopter, then had to grab the vehicle by the pontoons and pitch it off a cliff to be able to take off. Lou and Jim both received basketball scholarships to attend Seattle University. Both were pre-med majors and education minors, and both earned Bachelor of Science degrees in 1952. Instead of being deployed to the Korean War, they taught members of the Army’s 10th Special Forces Group how to ski and climb in the Colorado mountains. They were both honorably discharged when the superintendent of Mount Rainier National Park told the Defense Department that the mountain needed guides. “Him and I would think and speak alike, and even finish each other’s sentences,” Lou wrote in his book “Memoirs of a Mountain Guide,” published in 1995. “We’d just have to look at each other to know what the other was thinking.” Advertisement In the early 1960s, the brothers were selected to join a team of mountaineers aiming to be the first to summit Everest. As their training went on, Lou worried about supporting his wife and two children while earning no income for months. At the same time, he had the chance to buy into a sporting-goods store in Tacoma. He opted out of the expedition. When Jim returned as a celebrity, Lou met him at the airport. “Now you know you can do it, Lou,” Jim said. Yet their lives began to diverge. Jim got involved in politics, running Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 Democratic presidential primary campaign in Washington State and cutting back on mountaineering, while Lou got more involved in business. The two brothers tried climbing K2 together in 1975 but found themselves fighting, with Lou believing that Jim’s second wife, whom he had brought on the expedition, was in over her head. The two brothers, Lou wrote, stopped going on hikes together. Advertisement In 1969, he partnered with a local lawyer, Jerry Lynch, to establish RMI. Mr. Lynch handled the business side, and Lou trained guides, planned the routes and oversaw hikes. Early on, he gained a concession from Mount Rainier National Park to be the sole sanctioned guide service. Some of the world’s top climbers, like Ed Viesturs, have worked as RMI guides. Mount Rainier is an active volcano covered in glaciers that dominates its landscape: It can been clearly seen from Seattle, about 75 miles away. It is accessible enough for amateurs to climb but difficult enough to make reaching its summit feel like a major achievement. “I never get tired of seeing people’s faces when we get to the summit, of hearing them shout, or weep, with joy,” Lou wrote in his memoir. Lou and his sons founded many businesses and activities in Ashford, including a gear retailer, a shuttle bus service, a mountaineering training facility, a bar and grill, a bunkhouse and a film festival — all of which have made what was an old timber town into a popular base for tourists heading in and out of Mount Rainier National Park. Last year, when Jim visited Lou at home, Peter recalled, Lou walked over to his front door, using a cane — then put it aside, stood erect, threw his shoulders back and opened the door. The two old mountain men looked each other in the eye. “How much do you weigh?” Jim asked. “Two hundred,” Lou said. Jim smirked. “I’m 205,” he said. Advertisement He was the winner — the twins prized burliness. At 94, they were still trying to impress each other. Lou Whittaker married Patricia Wales in 1950; they separated in 1969 and later divorced. He married Ingrid Widmann in 1976. In addition to her, his brother and his sons, he is survived by three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Lou’s memoir chronicles a stomach-churning amount of death and injury. In 1981, 11 people died in an icefall during a climb guided in part by Peter. It was later determined to be an unavoidable act of nature. Lou himself led two Everest expeditions; during the first, in 1982, a beloved RMI guide, Marty Hoey, fell to her death. Lou estimated that he saved only half of the people he went after on rescue missions throughout his life. When he was not jovially holding court around Rainier, Lou revealed an introspectiveness he had gained reflecting on brushes with death and long hours alone on mountainsides. To explain his love of climbing high peaks, despite the risks, he liked to quote a line from “Dying Speech of an Old Philosopher,” a poem by Walter Savage Landor: “I warm’d both hands before the fire of Life.”","2024-04-05 13:04:13","https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/us/lou-whittaker-dead.html","New York Times"
"A New Way of Looking at the Nude","THE ARTIST PAUL Cadmus was flipping through Modern Maturity, the AARP’s official magazine, in 1991 when he saw something that made him angry. A disgruntled reader had written a letter to the editor slamming the publication for reproducing the Italian Renaissance artist Masaccio’s famous painting of Adam and Eve without including the fig leaves that church officials later added to cover their genitals. In response, Cadmus, then 87, created a drawing, titled “Shame!,” which was recently on view at New York’s DC Moore Gallery as part of the first major solo exhibition of the artist, who died in 1999, in more than 20 years. It shows a lithe white man, woman and child standing tall and naked, arms intertwined. At their feet, a cluster of grotesque, clothed figures, including a hooknosed priest and a mother covering her child’s eyes, writhe in disgust. Cadmus, who is best known for homoerotic images that relish the male form, later wrote that the letter’s author had provided “a profound definition of the word ‘pornography’: a naked man and woman.” In an ironic twist that surely would have provoked the artist’s ire, it’s impossible to access a reproduction of “Shame” online today without clicking a “N.S.F.W.” button. Nudes are one of the oldest and most stubbornly provocative tropes in Western art. Today, anyone with an internet connection can see a naked body at a moment’s notice (even if they have to press an extra button to do so). But the world in general, and the art world in particular, has remained largely conservative about what kinds of bodies it chooses to depict, celebrate and immortalize. In an age when Instagram polices nipples even as television shows like Euphoria traffic in erotic drama, a new generation of artists are mining this irony and working to broaden the aperture, breaking away from the idealized (usually white and thin) forms that have pervaded art for most of its documented existence. Instead, they are conjuring nudes that reflect a more fluid, more inclusive and fuller understanding of the body. At the same time, scholars and collectors are taking a new look at artists who were previously excluded from the canon because of the naturalistic, warts-and-all approach they took to the nude. Advertisement Fresh interpretations of the nude are front and center in a wave of exhibitions on view in New York this spring. At Bortolami gallery, there is Philip Pearlstein, whose dramatically cropped, unsentimental figures were profoundly unfashionable when he introduced them in the early 1960s. Gagosian is presenting its first exhibition of the photographer Francesca Woodman, who, before her death in 1981 at 22, created hundreds of strange, haunting photographs in which she used her naked body as a prop. Then there is Emily Coan, 32, at Dimin Gallery and Clarity Haynes, 52, at New Discretions, part of a group of contemporary artists who are using their own bodies and those of their friends to explore how femininity, gender identity and queerness can breathe new life into this often-vexing tradition. The story of the nude in Western art begins in ancient Greece, where sculptors sought to pay tribute to the gods by capturing them in idealized human form. When Renaissance artists revived interest in classical antiquity, the nude came along for the ride, mostly as a vessel to idealize the figures of the Christian faith and the Roman Catholic Church, which dominated Renaissance Europe. Some of these works had the suggestion of sensuality or, in the case of Donatello’s sculpture of St. Jerome, deflated classical beauty by focusing on a body in decline. Such notions violated the conservative sensibilities of the church, but it wasn’t until the 19th century when the nude truly began to skirt the borders of taste and propriety. Edouard Manet’s “Olympia” was a sensation. The combination of subject (a prostitute in the classical pose of a reclining female nude) and style (brushwork so flat that it highlights the artificiality of the image) was so shocking that visitors to the Paris Salon of 1865 tried to stab the canvas with their umbrellas. The painting was recently on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York — only the third time it has ever left Paris, though it cast a wide influence on the next century or so of nudes, from the frankness of Gustave Courbet’s “Origin of the World” (painted the year after the debut of “Olympia”) to Picasso’s 1932 series about his mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter, which brought explicit nudity into the world of abstraction. In his 1956 book “The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,” the art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that “the nude is not the subject of art, but a form of art.” In other words, the nude, with all its art-historical baggage, is an efficient means for artists to telegraph how their own perspective is distinct from that of their peers and predecessors. The trope can be especially powerful for women, queer people and artists of color, who have historically been more likely to be seen painted nude in a gallery or museum, rather than have their paintings of nudes exhibited there. No other genre has the capacity to interrogate, in a single figure, how we see and how we are seen. Advertisement WOMEN WEREN’T PERMITTED to study life drawing in the traditional Western art academy until the late 19th century; no female artist was included in Clark’s authoritative 400-page tome. But more recent scholarship has recovered a number of female and queer artists, including Cadmus, whose nudes were dismissed as unseemly or unserious in their own time and feel considerably more forward thinking now. In 2018, the Museum aan de Stroom in Antwerp staged an exhibition of the 17th-century Flemish artist Michaelina Wautier, who, the art historian Alison M. Gingeras notes, created the first known portrait of a nude man by a woman. Many of Wautier’s works had previously been misattributed to her brother. Last year, an ambitious exhibition organized by the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia argued that the French artist Marie Laurencin’s paintings of stylized nude women and animals were not a quirky footnote but rather a significant contribution to the turn-of-the-century Parisian avant-garde. Today’s artists embrace the nude for reasons ranging from the political to the personal to the practical (several mentioned that clothing automatically dates a painting). When Sasha Gordon, 26, was assigned to sketch her own body in a college anatomy class, the teacher didn’t know what to make of her billowy form. “The professor had a hard time stepping away from the European way of thinking, with all the certain muscles and bones that you could normally see in a leaner body,” says Gordon, whose mother is Korean. Today, Gordon places her own body — rendered in hyperrealistic detail — front and center in surreal scenes. (Her work was recently the subject of a solo show at the ICA Miami.) In “Trimmings” (2023), a nude Gordon uses garden shears to create a larger-than-life hedge version of herself. Looking out impishly at the viewer mid-snip, it’s as if she had broken into the pristine European-style garden to leave her mark. In a metaphor for her larger body of work, she makes herself into a monument without asking for permission. Advertisement Artists who seek to imbue the nude with new meaning still encounter some resistance. Doron Langberg, 38, whose lyrical portraits of queer lovers with their underwear around their ankles are rendered with the same gauzy reverential treatment as Claude Monet gave to the water lily, says that sexually explicit works still remain a hard sell to many institutions. (He is heartened, however, that the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Kunsthal Rotterdam are currently showing his erotic paintings.) Clarity Haynes, who is best known for painting the torsos of cancer survivors, queer and trans people, recalls a group of outraged museum donors walking out on her presentation of such works at the NADA art fair in Miami in 2018. And Emily Coan, whose witchy nude doppelgängers huddle around fires, drink and have sex with one another, notes that she and many of her contemporaries are unable to promote their work on Instagram because of the platform’s nudity policy. Even within the feminist art community, disagreements remain over whether certain kinds of nudes are objectifying or empowering. An earlier generation of painters who dealt with explicit imagery, including Joan Semmel and Betty Tompkins, received similar pushback in the 1970s, criticized for appealing to the male gaze even as they tried to subvert it. What makes this moment different is both the wider spectrum of bodies taking up space on the canvas and the sheer delight, playfulness and weirdness with which they are represented. Many of the artists engaging with the nude today grew up taking photos of themselves and posting them on the internet. They are comfortable toying with images of the body because they know what it’s like to be looked at — not only by someone on the subway or at the grocery store but by everyone all at once online. Advertisement What artists playing with the unclothed human form today share in common is a fundamental lack of shame. For Haynes, the act of painting the nude is, more than anything else, an antidote to shame. Before she turned her focus on her community, she started out in 1997 depicting her own torso. It was a way, she recalls, to reacquaint herself with her body after getting sober, leaving her job as a stripper and recognizing how much of her existence had been informed by being sexually harassed on the street. “I thought I would see an exaggerated sexy person,” she says, “and what I saw was just a human being. I saw myself as a human being for the first time.”","2024-04-03 16:16:25","https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/t-magazine/contemporary-nude-art.html","New York Times"
"Her Art Is at Odds With Museums, and Museums Can’t Get Enough","Inside the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, little pieces of Antarctica were melting: cross-sections of an ice core from the continent’s Newall Glacier, each one about the size of a beverage coaster and encased in a vacuum-sealed plastic bag. The artist Gala Porras-Kim watched approvingly during a visit in March, pointing out the air pockets that had started to form. “The ice cores are an archive of ancient air, because the air gets stuck in the layers of ice,” she said, pointing at the display during an interview at the museum. This particular core, which Porras-Kim had obtained from the National Science Foundation’s Ice Core Facility in nearby Lakewood, Colo., contained ice that had formed some 10,000 years ago, around the beginning of the Holocene period, in geological terms. Porras-Kim, an interdisciplinary artist who often questions how museums collect material from previous civilizations, was also planning to debut what she called an “ice performance” at the opening of her solo exhibition on March 8: “Gala Porras-Kim: A Hand in Nature.” That night, and at monthly intervals thereafter, an unsealed piece of the core would be placed on a silver tray and allowed to thaw. “The ancient air will get released into this room — a reunion of this old air with the new air, mixing together,” she said, describing it as an “organic de-accession process.” Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.","2024-04-05 09:02:03","https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/arts/design/gala-porras-kim-denver.html","New York Times"

"Where to Drink Wine in Chicago","The motto of Chicago ought to be, “Too much to do, not enough time.” That’s how I feel whenever I visit. Whether restaurants, architecture, museums or music, Chicago overflows with wonderful options, and that certainly extends to great places to drink wine. On a recent trip that unfortunately coincided with a biting Arctic blast, I sought out warm refuges with superb food and intriguing wine lists. I was looking for casual, comfortable places that served full meals and offered lists with a clear personality. I omitted the sorts of classic, expensive Michelin-starred restaurants where you would expect to find extensive wine lists. These eight places stood out as distinctive emblems of Chicago’s singular Midwestern character. I could have included many more, like Beautiful Rind, a lovely cheese and wine shop where you can pay a small corkage fee to open bottles with cheese and salumi; Easy Does It, an excellent natural wine bar with a modest menu; Bronzeville Winery, a thoughtful wine bar that celebrates its South Side neighborhood; Daisies, a fascinating restaurant with a small selection of Midwestern wines embedded in its list; and other places I loved, like Lula Cafe and Avec. Not enough time. Here they are, in no particular order. This French Canadian restaurant in Lakeview looks exactly as I picture a French Canadian place: cozy and warm, knotty wood floors, a bit spare. There’s no place I would rather be on a freezing winter day, though I think I might feel that way any time of year. The food is soulful, the wine list chosen with care and the hospitality gracious. My cold-weather menu included delicate, oceanic fried smelts; Canadian bacon with a refreshing corn relish and wonderful, housemade bread; a crisp, perfectly seasoned pork schnitzel; and striped bass with brown butter topped with sunchoke chips. To end, what else but Canada’s favorite dessert, an exquisite butter tart. The wine list is not exhaustive, but it’s hard to go wrong. Every bottle was something I wanted to drink, whether a dry riesling from Forge in the Finger Lakes, a white blend from Luis Seabra in the Douro or a teroldego from Elisabetta Foradori in Trentino. Almost every bottle is under $100. I settled on a focused, gentle 2018 Savigny-les-Beaune aux Clous from Louis Chenu Père & Filles. 2965 North Lincoln Avenue, dearmargaretchi.com. This small, spare, amiable restaurant in Logan Square on the northwest side offers just a few modest yet beautifully detailed dishes on its ever-changing menu and a concise, well-chosen list of natural wines almost entirely under $100. You might begin with a 2021 Le Rose from Ca’ de Noci in Emilia-Romagna, a light, fresh sparkling malvasia that is so good you won’t want to stop drinking it. That went brilliantly with fried onions tempura-style with romesco sauce and an earthy pig’s head terrine. We followed that up with a 2021 riesling from Jean Ginglinger in Alsace, a stony, floral wine that was alive in the glass, superb with cheesy gnocchi in a savory ham broth and nutty braised broccoli rabe. Neither the menu nor the list is exhaustive, but with either, it was hard to go wrong. 3025 West Diversey Avenue, cellardoorprovisions.com. Monday brunch, as this excellent French bistro in River North calls that day’s midday meal, comes with a bubbly benefit: half-price bottles of Champagne. It has another thing going for it, too. While Obélix looks like a modern spot for hushed business meetings, situated in a nondescript downtown building, it’s actually relaxed and unpretentious, the kind of place business people go to escape uptight offices. The food is classic French with a few creative touches. A beautifully composed pâté en croûte was made with wild boar and duck, while a generous Lyonnaise salad was topped with a duck egg, crisp duck confit and duck fat croutons. This being brunch, Obélix offered deviations from the standard fare, like merguez served as a hot dog and Korean-style fried chicken on a burger bun, with excellent frites. The wine list is almost entirely French and contains predictably expensive Burgundies, Bordeaux and other trophies. But it also offers plenty of bottles under $100, including some gems, like a 2020 Brézème from Éric Texier, an excellent syrah from the Côtes-du-Rhône, and a 2019 Domaine de Galouchey Vin de Jardin, a delicious natural Bordeaux. And if you come midday Monday, Champagne is a treat and a great value. 700 North Sedgwick Street, obelixchicago.com. Even if you’ve never been to the Village in the Loop, you most likely know the genre. Sinatra ate there. So did Capone. At nearly a century old, covered with photos of celebrities of the past, it’s the sincere incarnation of the sort of place Carbone was meant to parody and augment. The wine list, however, is enormous and astounding. You will not find cutting edge Italian wines here, but you will see deep reserves of Italian classics here, including older vintages of Brunellos, Barolos and Super Tuscans, a label coined in the 1980s for top Tuscan wines that did not conform to appellation rules. The Village is red wine territory, but you might start with a crisp sparkling wine like a 2016 Ferrari Perlé Rosé Riserva, with its mild but pure scent of berries. Where to go after that? I chose a lovely expressive Barolo, a 2012 Renato Ratti Conca, which I thought was a good value at $130. The unsurprising Italian American food is a mixed bag — terrific beef ravioli served under an ocean of meaty red sauce, and sweet, tender eggplant parmigiana. But veal marsala was bland and muddy. Stick with red sauce and enjoy exploring the list, with upward of 1,200 bottles. 71 West Monroe Street, thevillage-chicago.com. This sprawling restaurant in the West Loop manages to straddle the Adriatic Sea, blending Italian and Croatian elements in what the chef, Joe Flamm, calls “Adriatic drinking food.” The wine list is wide-ranging, with concentrations from France, Germany and the United States, but the most exciting element is the small selection of Eastern European wines from Slovenia and Croatia. These might include a lively sparkling refosco rosé from Rodica, an organic winery in Slovenia, or a Vinas Mora Andreis, a fresh, bright, natural Croatian red made of the babic grape, which tastes like a combination of pinot noir and gamay. These wines go beautifully with Adriatic dishes like burek, a flaky pastry filled with chard and cheeses, grilled clams in a shockingly green herbal sauce, mezzaluna pasta in a bright duck ragù and tender lamb saddle with roasted carrots, full of garlic and herbs and served off the bone like a porterhouse. Rose Mary is by no means a sedate date place. It’s lively, maybe even boisterous in the best possible way. 932 West Fulton Market, rosemarychicago.com. Not far from Rose Mary in the West Loop is El Che, an Argentine steak house with a superb wine list made up entirely of South American bottles. Yes, you can drink inexpensively here, with many wines under $100 like, among whites, a liter of Pipeño Blanco from A Los Viñateros Bravos, a farmer’s blend from Itata in Chile, or an Argentine sémillon from Mendel in Mendoza. But this is an opportunity to try some of the better reds South America has to offer, like a 2020 Concreto malbec from Zuccardi, a superb, minerally malbec, or even splurge on something special, like a 2016 Zuccardi Finca Piedra Infinita for $360. Reds like these are meant for beef. El Che’s are all cooked over wood coals. Options include a dry-aged strip, which has all the funk and tang you look for in dry-aging, or, if its available, a picanha, a smaller cut like a rump steak. The crisp beef-fat fries are not to be missed, while an endive salad is an archetypal steakhouse salve for the conscience. 845 West Washington Boulevard, elchechicago.com. This sprawling neighborhood spot with a welcoming vibe is the granddaddy of Chicago wine bars, having opened in 1994 in Lincoln Park and still going strong in its second location in Logan Square. The wine list, primarily European, is wise, seemingly tempered by years of experience. It resists the temptation to offer a bunch of trophy labels either too young or unaffordable to any but the wealthy. Instead, it’s impeccably chosen, with bottles selected to drink now. With oysters, I drank an excellent biodynamically farmed 2020 Boissonneuse Chablis from Julien Brocard, combining the seashell character of Chablis with the richness of the 2020 vintage. The food extends beyond classic wine bar fare to include pasta, seafood and a steak frites. 2601 North Milwaukee Avenue, websterwinebar.com. This small, casual restaurant in Logan Square, practices a considered eclecticism in both its food and its wine. The food combinations and juxtapositions are unconventional with an overriding goal of deliciousness. The same is true with wine. Consider dishes like sweet, tangy Japanese eggplant, flavored with South Asian spices and served with pita, or okonomiyaki, eggy Japanese pancakes under a pile of greens, a riot of textures and flavors. Chiramonte, a tortelloni-like pasta, is served in a nutty lentil ragù with mint and bright Meyer lemon, a brilliantly balanced dish. The worldly, beautifully chosen wine list follows suit, with plenty of versatile, refreshing bottles, the vast majority priced at under $100. I particularly enjoyed a fresh, herbal 2021 Sonoma trousseau gris from Jolie Laide, which came alive in the glass, and a graceful crunchy 2022 gamay from Ochota Barrels in the Adelaide Hills of Australia. 3209 West Armitage Avenue, 773-252-0997, giantrestaurant.com.

"What’s the Quickest Path to World War III?","THE RETURN OF GREAT POWERS: Russia, China, and the Next World War, by Jim Sciutto UP IN ARMS: How Military Aid Stabilizes — and Destabilizes — Foreign Autocrats, by Adam E. Casey Every few months in the years that Donald J. Trump was president, Iran made a show of its ballistic missiles — the powerful rockets that can deliver nuclear warheads from one nation to another — and set off a small panic in Washington. The tests went like this: A missile flew up from one part of Iran, traveled through the country’s airspace and, ideally, blew up harmlessly in another part of Iran, hundreds of miles away. The former White House political adviser John Kelly remembers that, on one such occasion, after intelligence of an impending missile launch came in, Trump said he wanted to shoot the weapon down. “Well, sir, that’s an act of war,” Kelly recalls telling him. “You really need to go over to Congress and get at least an authorization.” “They’ll never go along with it,” Trump apparently replied. “Well, I know,” Kelly said. “But that’s our system.” This anecdote and many other alarming scenes appear in Jim Sciutto’s “The Return of Great Powers,” an absorbing account of 21st-century brinkmanship. Sciutto has interviewed several of Trump’s former advisers, including Kelly, who explains that he managed to talk his old boss out of some of his worst ideas only by suggesting they would hurt his standing in public opinion. “Americans, generally speaking by polling, think that we should be involved in the world,” he recalls telling Trump when the president threatened to pull the United States out of NATO. The former national security adviser John Bolton is even more blunt about this episode. “Honest to God,” Bolton says, “it was frightening because we didn’t know what he was going to do up until the last minute.” That such political figures would speak so candidly can be partly credited to Sciutto’s standing as CNN’s chief national security analyst and his earlier stint with the State Department under Barack Obama. He’s the kind of well-connected reporter who, as we learn in this book, gets a call at 3 a.m., in February 2022, from an unnamed Congress member to warn him that a war in Ukraine is imminent. It also reflects the unbridled horror that insiders like Kelly and Bolton feel at the prospect of a second Trump administration taking charge amid a perilous superpower chess game. “The Return of Great Powers” argues that we are living through a Cold War redux that once again pits the United States against Russia and China. The battle is being waged on every imaginable front, from undersea communication cables to satellites in outer space and the growing frontiers of artificial intelligence. Sciutto begins with cinematic jumps between an eclectic assortment of personalities — American generals and congressional leaders, Finnish diplomats and Taiwanese naval captains — in the days and hours leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In later sections, the white-knuckle tension he experiences as Russian warplanes close in on a NATO fleet conducting exercises near the Baltic Sea is eerily echoed by Chinese jets operating in the Taiwan Strait. One great difference between this cold war and the last, Sciutto contends, is that the guardrails erected to prevent superpower rivalries from sliding into catastrophe have been steadily dismantled. Over the past quarter-century, both the United States and Russia have abandoned one arms control treaty after another and lines of communication between all three powers have been purposely reduced. As one unnamed State Department official tells Sciutto, when a mysterious Chinese balloon drifted across North America last fall, the Chinese military “refused to pick up the phone.” Add to this precarity those proxy mischief-makers — North Korea, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, to name a few — that might see advantage in provoking a superpower showdown. It’s enough to send those with a front-row view into the old basement bomb shelter. Or to cause them to share their fears with a reputable journalist. Virtually all of Sciutto’s interlocutors are aligned: A defeated Ukraine will embolden Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, to attack one of the other countries, perhaps Estonia or Moldova, that have already caught his covetous eye. It might also encourage an impatient Xi Jinping of China to force a military solution to “the Taiwan question,” an event that some observers see as a precursor to global war. Having identified the peril, Sciutto’s panelists also agree on the solutions: unwavering commitment to the defense of Ukraine; greater integration of NATO forces; much closer cooperation between the European and Asian blocs of democratic nations. Ironically, many of these recommendations are now being enacted thanks to the Russian invasion and Chinese encroachments — long-neutral Sweden and Finland have joined NATO, and East Asian nations have strengthened their mutual defense pacts. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t cause for concern. Trump, once again his party’s presumptive presidential nominee, has fought against U.S. military aid to Ukraine and urged Russia “to do whatever the hell” it wants to NATO members who fail to meet their financial obligations. The litany of international dangers Sciutto describes, set alongside the recollections of some of Trump’s closest former advisers, is the stuff of unholy nightmares. For all its strengths, “The Return of Great Powers” sometimes displays a peculiar awkwardness in conveying others’ views. Sciutto can let his subjects meander around points that are not particularly interesting or original — or, at times, even comprehensible. On the matter of standing up to Russia, for example, he quotes a senior Western diplomat as stating: “The idea that we can’t do this is completely false, but the problem is also economically and physically we have that capability. But then, do we have it politically? It’s going to be a different game. But am I concerned? Yes.” I suppose I’d be concerned, too, if only I could grasp what he’s talking about. Still, these are mere quibbles when set against the import of Sciutto’s book, one that should be read by every legislator or presidential nominee sufficiently deluded to think that returning America to its isolationist past or making chummy with Putin is a viable option in today’s world. The ideal way forward for a great power like the United States has always been fraught, and looking back at the mistakes and successes of the Cold War is often instructive, but not always. Adam E. Casey’s “Up in Arms” is well written and clearly the product of prodigious research; it also shows how Cold War comparisons can sometimes go too far. Casey, a former academic who is now a national security analyst for a curiously unspecified branch of the U.S. government, sets out to re-examine the accepted wisdom that U.S. aid to totalitarian regimes served to maintain and prolong those dictatorships during the latter half of the 20th century. In rebutting this thesis, he sets out some statistics that are initially eye-catching. According to his examination of hundreds of Cold War authoritarian regimes, Soviet-supported rulers survived, on average, twice as long as American-supported ones. Most startling, in any given year, U.S.-backed dictators were about seven times more likely to fall than their Soviet counterparts. As he points out, though, the Soviets exported their own military model to client states, which meant an armed forces thoroughly infiltrated by Communist Party commissars, and counterintelligence officers whose primary focus was keeping watch over the ideological steadfastness of their own rank and file. The result was an army wholly subordinate to the party and the state, drastically reducing the odds of a military coup. By contrast, the U.S.-military model called for building out an anti-communist army independent of whatever tyrant happened to be in power at the time, often leading to the creation of a parallel power base that might ultimately challenge said tyrant. The American method was less durable, because it often yielded a round robin of military coups led by anti-communist officers against other anti-communist officers. How did these different approaches alter the global chessboard? Remarkably, hardly at all. While Casey astutely points out that the American model was a perfect breeding ground for corruption, human rights abuses and governmental instability, he also notes that over the entire half-century span of the Cold War, only one military coup — Laos in 1960 — led to an actual ideological realignment of a U.S.-backed regime, and then only briefly. This is why, Casey explains, American cold warriors weren’t inclined to change course, despite their awareness of the chaos they had wrought. Casey gamely suggests his findings might have currency as the planet enters another period of superpower jockeying, but it is hard to see precisely how this military-proxy dynamic of yore replicates itself. China has never shown much interest in extending its martial reach to countries beyond Asia, and Russian military tutelage is surely trading at a deep discount after its dismal Ukrainian outing. As for the United States, while displaying little reservation about cozying up to despots when convenient — witness some of the grotesqueries it has climbed into bed with for the so-called “war on terror” — it’s hard to imagine any eagerness to go back to the days of army-building in the wake of America’s Iraq and Afghanistan war hangovers. That being said, the last Cold War went on for decades. In 10 or 20 years, the hangovers could fade. China’s economic ties to countries like Uganda and Ethiopia, Russia’s support of Cuba and Venezuela and American entanglements in Southeast Asia and the Middle East all have the potential to turn from cold to warm, or from warm to boiling hot. Giving up on democracy is all the rage these days. The leaders of the great powers could start eyeing Cold War-inspired playbooks like Casey’s, with dire results for everyone caught in between.

"Why States Have Spent Billions Subsidizing Hollywood","By Matt Stevens A reporter covering arts and culture State governments use our tax dollars to build roads, fund schools and provide health care.

"Secrets of a Danish Castle","My first conscious memory occurred on the lower landing of a staircase that spiraled up four floors of the 14th-century, moat-encircled Gjorslev castle in Denmark.

I was 3 years old.

"Joe Biden Is More Than His Age","To the Editor: Re “The Overlooked Truths About Biden’s Age,” by Frank Bruni (Opinion, March 30): Mr. Bruni was absolutely right to point out that the presidency is not a one-person job. When we go to the polls in November we are electing a general manager/captain/coach. His job is then to get the team assembled and come up with a plan. That is what our executive branch is about. The president needs the right people under him and around him. Joe Biden put together a great cabinet and other advisers quite quickly three and a half years ago. Seven and a half years ago, Donald Trump put together a band of conniving circus performers. The country needs a team that will offer support as well as alternatives and criticism to the president and will keep us all safe “from sea to shining sea.” Let’s not focus on the speed of Mr. Biden’s gait or the loudness of his voice. We need to keep our sights set on his sanity and on his mental abilities, which are still functioning quite well. Janis DelsonNew York To the Editor: Like President Biden, I turn 82 this fall. As I imagine is true for us both, the stairs have gotten steeper, the newsprint smaller, sleep more interrupted. And, yes, we sometimes experience brief memory freezes as the memory bubbles surface more slowly through our brain’s molasses. As fellow old men, we understand the difference between forgetting a name and dementia. Yet my profession — psychological science — documents that we octogenarians retain or grow three important strengths, which, to affirm Frank Bruni, “get too little consideration”: Crystallized intelligence. Our knowledge and the ability to apply it crest later in life. Thus many historians, philosophers and artists produce their most noteworthy work in late career. Wisdom. With maturity, people can better take multiple perspectives, offer sagacity amid conflicts and appreciate their fallibility. The wisdom to know when we know a thing and when we do not is born of experience. Emotional stability. As the years go by, our feelings mellow. With age, we find ourselves less often excited, but also less often depressed. Compliments produce less elation; criticisms, less despair. So, yes, the president will sometimes misspeak or forget. But he will also benefit from the maturity that enables his navigating the “battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses” (his words). David G. MyersHolland, Mich.The writer, a Hope College social psychologist, is the author of “How Do We Know Ourselves: Curiosities and Marvels of the Human Mind.” To the Editor: Our Constitution mandates that a president must be at least 35 years old. Given the advanced ages of Joe Biden and Donald Trump, coupled with rampant dissatisfaction on all sides of the political spectrum, this may be the ideal moment to amend the Constitution. If we require a minimum age, why not a maximum age limit, perhaps 75? Like many older voters, I value the contributions of our generation, but it’s time to pass the torch. Judith BishopNew York To the Editor: Frank Bruni has it about right in citing Joe Biden’s positive presidential attributes and the importance of the team around him in defending him against attacks based on his age. But the best summation I’ve heard thus far came from an independent voter interviewed after voting in a primary, who said, “I’d rather vote for a guy who has 81 years behind him than a guy who has 91 felony charges ahead of him” (recently reduced to 88). David RubinCanton, Mass. To the Editor: Re “Speaker Floats Possible Terms for Aid to Kyiv” (front page, April 2): The U.S. Congress has to understand that support for Ukraine is an investment in the freedom and independence of a sovereign nation that was invaded by Russia. Investing now in victory for Ukraine will avoid the need to spend billions to counter aggression by the autocratic regimes in China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, which will see weakness and take steps to exploit it. Ed HoulihanRidgewood, N.J. To the Editor: Re “Gabriel García Márquez Wanted His Last Novel to Be Destroyed,” by Álvaro Santana-Acuña (Opinion guest essay, March 17): At first, I was quick to condemn the sons of Gabriel García Márquez, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. García Márquez died 10 years ago, and against his wishes, Rodrigo and Gonzalo have now published “Until August.” For shame! Such greed! Yet I was swayed by Mr. Santana-Acuña’s excellent guest essay. He argues that “Until August” is the “unpolished work of an aging master” and “should be read as such.” He reminds us that Franz Kafka ordered his friend Max Brod to burn his unfinished works — but Brod did not: “This betrayal changed the history of literature and the life of a young man who, after reading ‘The Metamorphosis,’ decided to become a writer.” Indeed, as García Márquez told The Paris Review, when he read that Gregor Samsa awoke as a gigantic insect, “I thought to myself that I didn’t know anyone was allowed to write things like that. If I had known, I would have started writing a long time ago.’” I recently borrowed “Until August” from the library. In the preface, Rodrigo and Gonzalo question whether “the fading faculties” that kept their father “from finishing the book also kept him from realizing how good it was. In an act of betrayal, we decided to put his readers’ pleasure ahead of all other considerations. If they are delighted, it’s possible Gabo might forgive us. In that we trust.” I for one was delighted to hear the great writer’s voice again. Carol WestonArmonk, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Toxic Gun Culture Begins at Home,” by Elizabeth Spiers (Opinion guest essay, March 28): Ms. Spiers writes about “how the Crumbleys’ attitudes and actions reflect an increasingly insidious gun culture that treats guns as instruments of defiance and rebellion rather than as a means of last resort.” She was referring to Ethan Crumbley, who shot and killed four students and wounded seven others at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021, and to his parents, Jennifer and James Crumbley, who were convicted separately of involuntary manslaughter in the massacre by their son, then 15 years old. The Crumbleys were the first parents in the United States to be directly charged for the deaths caused by a child in a mass shooting at a school. As the father of two children who survived the Oxford High School shooting, I have reflected very often on this tragedy over the last two years and believe that Ms. Spiers’s essay strikes at the heart of a difficult truth about our nation’s relationship with guns. It is obvious that the Crumbleys could have taken simple steps to prevent this tragedy. It is true that legislation matters and will make a difference. However, the hard reality is that until we come to terms with these deeply rooted aspects of gun culture in the suburbs and exurbs, where many of these mass shootings occur, we will regrettably experience more of these tragedies.
